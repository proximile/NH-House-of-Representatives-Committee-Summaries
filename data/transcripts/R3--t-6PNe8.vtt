00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm going to charge the
 
00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
committee with
 
00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 align:start position:0%

that can present on some of the issues
 
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
that we're facing but this isn't going
 
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
to be the only presentations we'll hear
 
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 align:start position:0%

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
um Bob Quinn and Crystal Norwood for New
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%

thank you for having us so I am uh Bob
 
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
Quinn I am the CEO of the New Hampshire
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I am Chris Norwood and I am the 2023
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
public policy chair for the New
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association and I'm also an
 
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
owner of a real estate brokerage firm uh
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
focusing primarily in the commercial
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
real estate space uh but there is a
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
connection there with the housing crisis
 
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
so I think our role today is sort of uh
 
00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
help you set the scene of where the
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
housing market has been recently
 
00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
um and potentially where it's going uh
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we hear from folks
 
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
the thought that that the housing
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
inventory crisis is a result of
 
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
increasing interest rates or uh the
 
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
increasing interest rates or uh the
pandemic

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
um but hopefully we're going to walk you
 
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.250 align:start position:0%
um but hopefully we're going to walk you
through

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
um some statistics and show you that
 
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
this inventory crisis has been a long
 
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
time in the making
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
um and while the pandemic may have
 
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
accelerated uh some of the some of the
 
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
issues it's been going on now for at
 
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
least a decade
 
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
so if I can get this to work
 
00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if you guys can see
 
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
this but this is um uh our housing
 
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
affordability index
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to hand out something
 
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
to you afterwards so you guys can all
 
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
have a copy of this but uh basically
 
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 align:start position:0%
what the index says is uh if you have
 
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
120 index that means that median income
 
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
across the state is a hundred and twenty
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
percent of what the median sale price of
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
a home is so 120 index is a good number
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
we're at 76 right now
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
so what that means is the median income
 
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
the one on the left
 
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
is the one that's everything so right
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
it's just that one just did a spotlight
 
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah
 
00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just you know I will hand out
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
the specifics I think it's just
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
generally to get a sense of you know
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
um of what's going on so we're at the
 
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
index at 76 hope and that's a unique
 
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
thing for the first time in
 
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.689 align:start position:0%
thing for the first time in
um

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
so for the first time in uh whitson's
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
we've been
 
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.550 align:start position:0%
we've been
um

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
we've been Distributing this index the
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
numbers have dropped below 100. so the
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire residents now
 
00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
cannot afford and the median price of a
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
home in January was 415 000 the other
 
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
thing I just point to is you'll notice
 
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
um and you've hard drives C here but the
 
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
yellow line is single family homes the
 
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
blue line is condos but that
 
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
affordability number started dropping
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
around 2013 and you see a slow decline
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and that's going to be a theme you're
 
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
yeah representation thank you
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
um if you could go back to the last
 
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
slide really quick that big spike in the
 
00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.790 align:start position:0%
slide really quick that big spike in the
middle

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
middle
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
um is that 2008 I'm trying I can't
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
really see the numbers so 2010
 
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.529 align:start position:0%
really see the numbers so 2010
um

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's sort of the the recession
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
um started in 2000 and
 
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
really nine eight nine uh and how it
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
impacted the Housing Industry in New
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for about four years five
 
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
years afterwards so the peak was 2013
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
so on me and sale price uh trend line
 
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
going the opposite way uh so pricing has
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
gone up and I would just point out
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
um you'll notice that we sort of left
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
median sale price uh at two hundred
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars at about 2013. we hit
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
300 000 five years later in 2018.
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
we then hit
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
400 000 in about two and a half years
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
and last year we topped out at 460 000
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
and that only took one year
 
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.309 align:start position:0%
and that only took one year
so

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
um it is it sort of it is accelerating
 
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
this since 2019 pre-pandemic
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
single-family housing median sale price
 
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
has increased 46 percent
 
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.110 align:start position:0%
has increased 46 percent
um

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
it went from 300 000 in 2019 to a peak
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
of 2022 of 440 thousand dollars at this
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
point if you just looked at uh CPI from
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
2019 to 2022 that would be just under
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
three it should be under just under 350
 
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
000. so housing obviously and we're up
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
we're ninety thousand dollars above that
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
so housing is accelerating much quicker
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
than CPI is just a quick question please
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
um you said that um it's accelerating
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like you expect that to
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
continue is that correct I'm going to
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
get to that in just one second oh thank
 
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.610 align:start position:0%
get to that in just one second oh thank
you

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so that's median sale price that's
 
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
one end of the equation and now we'll
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
look at total number of closed sales so
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
in January of this year
 
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
um there were a total of 628 closed
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
sales uh in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
that is the lowest monthly number that
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen since
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
um uh February of 2011. so
 
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.430 align:start position:0%
um uh February of 2011. so
as

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
we've seen uh pricing increasing
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
closed sales are are decreasing
 
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
what about demand
 
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.769 align:start position:0%
what about demand
um

00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
so this is uh the days in the market for
 
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
an average single family home and you'll
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
notice here that we're at about in
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
January is about 37 days so that's the
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
time that it would go on the market
 
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:12.500 align:start position:0%
until you get an offer that you accept
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
so right now in January there was 37
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
days this past summer we saw it get as
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
low as 13 days so two weeks you've all
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
heard stories about houses that go on
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
the market on a Friday afternoon they
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
get 10 offers and one's accepted on
 
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.210 align:start position:0%
get 10 offers and one's accepted on
Monday

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:28.220 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
that I think it's fair to say
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
anecdotally you may not see that quite
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
as much as you did in 2020 but I'm
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
talking to a lot of Realtors saying hey
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's back there are lines to showings
 
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm getting many multiple offers on
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
properties again and keep in mind we're
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
talking about January and February that
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
is the low point of
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
real estate is cyclical so you're going
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
to start to see medium price go up in
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
the summer time January February is when
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's at the lowest mark representative
 
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.949 align:start position:0%
it's at the lowest mark representative
Reed

00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
Reed
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:00.370 align:start position:0%
thank you
um not

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:00.380 align:start position:0%
um not
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly to your point but I was
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's impacted the time it
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
takes to close as well is that also
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
gotten shorter or has that basically
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
been the same I think that's pretty much
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
been the same I don't think there's
 
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
something any we don't have any data on
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
that that might be something do you have
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
an uh do you happen to just from your
 
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
experience have about a ballpark
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to Ballpark it I mean
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's I've known some closings to occur
 
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:28.019 align:start position:0%
very quickly in a matter of just 10 days
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
I've also known closings that can
 
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
because it really does become what kind
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
of inspections do you want what's in the
 
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
contracts sometimes the the property
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
owner may want to sell the home and I've
 
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
heard stories saying we're going to stay
 
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
in this home for six months afterwards
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to rent it back to us or
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
something like that so the closing
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes can take a while
 
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.769 align:start position:0%
sometimes can take a while
just

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah cash closing would you say a cash
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
close goes quicker than
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
the finance close no question about it
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and then that's always the
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
challenge and we just saw it was just an
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
article this week about that in terms of
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
the increase on cash sales
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
um and that's really been a put a lot of
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
pressure on first-time homebuyers
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
um because obviously a first-time
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
homebuyer is usually younger they don't
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
have the cash the competition that
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes occurs because you've got a
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
young couple who are looking to buy a
 
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
starter home at the same time you have a
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
retiree who may be looking to downsize
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
they've just sold their home obviously
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
looking at that median sale price
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of cash so they come to
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
the to the negotiation with that cash
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
if you're a seller more times than not
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to take the cash offer
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
because it goes quicker less chance of a
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
um that's also a huge a huge issue here
 
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
representative freedom
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
sort of a follow-up and so you made a
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
comparison between a young couple that
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
might not have a lot of cash in say an
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
older couple but that's also true
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
obviously if say corporate buyers things
 
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
of that nature they would have money up
 
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.870 align:start position:0%
of that nature they would have money up
front

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
front
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
of a single family home sure
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
well I wasn't going to bring this up and
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
I didn't have another presentation but
 
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.090 align:start position:0%
I didn't have another presentation but
um

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
so I guess it's a defining a corporate
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
buyer in a single family home
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'm talking about single-family
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
homes Chris can talk about multi-family
 
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.030 align:start position:0%
homes Chris can talk about multi-family
so

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
the National Association of Realtors
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
just did a study on investment and
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
basically corporate buyers or properties
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
in every state in the country New
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was actually only Alaska was
 
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
had fewer of those sorts of buyers than
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire most of the corporate
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
buyers that are occurring um you see
 
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
them at Texas and Georgia lead the way
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
the reason is large corporations come in
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
they'll find opportunity right they're
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
looking for opportunities they're
 
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:38.660 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
undervalued homes there aren't that many
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
of them in the country right now but in
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
certain areas they are so they'll go in
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
they'll buy up 50 100 properties
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
in an underserved area and they'll fix
 
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
them up so maybe they're renting a
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
number 800 bucks they fix them up
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
knowing that they can rent them for 17
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
1800 to a different type of person
 
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:04.100 align:start position:0%
um and that creates obviously
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
gentrification and issues with uh
 
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.449 align:start position:0%
gentrification and issues with uh
displacement

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
displacement
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
but in New Hampshire was four percent uh
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
total single-family homes were purchased
 
00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.269 align:start position:0%
total single-family homes were purchased
through

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
um uh an investment like a corporation
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind that includes llc's and
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure representative Broody can
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
tell you a lot of families purchase
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
homes through llc's as well for tax
 
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
reasons and other and other purposes so
 
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
reasons and other and other purposes so
um

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative Reed thank you Mr
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
chair for your patience and thank you
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question again just to
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
kind of follow up on that I'm wondering
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
why and I am including llc's in that
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
um and this may be more pertinent to
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
multi-family so maybe we can answer that
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
later down the line but uh there have
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
been numerous reports of people who are
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
going into specifically to rent out
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
units that are paying actually over our
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
current market rate sometimes over 50
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
percent more than the current market
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
rate with the philosophy and this is a
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
direct quote saying that there's no
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
amount you can pay that wouldn't make
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
that profitable so I'm wondering how you
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
kind of square what you just said with
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
what we've seen
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
in those comments
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm going to let Chris answer
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
that question I I would just say I I
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't know anyone who would come into a
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
property and say I'll pay anything
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
because I can make my money back all
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
right so you should be happy to because
 
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
at some point you're gonna have to have
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet that shows you that a
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
product can reoccur so I'll let when
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
Chris get maybe we could finish this up
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'll let them continue for a while then
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'll take more questions
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
all right so I just want to point out
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
that the days on the market the demand
 
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
for single-family housing is still
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
extremely strong all right so we have a
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
lot of demand and not a lot of closings
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
so why would that be
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
um and what we would say it's because of
 
00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.670 align:start position:0%
um and what we would say it's because of
inventory

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
and again you look at inventory here
 
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
yellow uh is the single family homes
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
Blue is condos there has been a study
 
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
decline in inventory
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
um total number of homes for sale over
 
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
the past decade yes it's sort of
 
00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:16.019 align:start position:0%
accelerated during the pandemic but we
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
were already on the path for uh the
 
00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
total number of homes being for sale so
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
right now in January for instance there
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
were 1200 they're about 1300 homes in
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for sale you know you go
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
back just five years and you can easily
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
find up to five thousand homes uh for
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
sale so a significant drop in inventory
 
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.069 align:start position:0%
sale so a significant drop in inventory
um

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to encourage the
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
committee to write your questions down
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
you can ask right after to allow them to
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
present fully on everything thank you
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
another way of looking at inventory is
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
Supply uh months of Supply so this is if
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
everything that is on the market right
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
now uh were to where to sell how fast
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
would that be depleted
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
um so what healthy environment is
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
somewhere between four and six months
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
that means buyers and sellers are on
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
equal footing in terms of the
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
negotiation so we're at 1.1 months in
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
January and we have certainly seen that
 
00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:16.339 align:start position:0%
drop below uh one month as well so
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's certainly another indication that
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
inventory is a problem
 
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:22.970 align:start position:0%
inventory is a problem
um

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
this gets to I think someone's question
 
00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:26.810 align:start position:0%
this gets to I think someone's question
regarding

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
um where we see things kind of where
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
things are headed so this is year over
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
year uh medium price change so this is
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
2022. so
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
um on the far left is January and the
 
00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
far right is December and so the January
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
number would be comparing the change
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
from 2021 to 2022. so for instance in
 
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
January was about 14 median price
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
increase but as you can see as the year
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
has gone down gone by
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
pricing is still increasing from 20 in
 
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
2022 from 2021 but the rate is starting
 
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
to decline we're at uh in January it
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to January we're now at four
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
percent so I guess that's a big question
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know when we get to April where we
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
start to see that being zero but again I
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
think it's important to put everything
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
in context we're comparing 2023 to 2022
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%
um when we all knew that there was a
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
significant inventory and housing
 
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.429 align:start position:0%
significant inventory and housing
shortage

00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
we also hear a lot of concerns a lot of
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
questions that hey
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
this is a national issue
 
00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
um so New Hampshire is no different from
 
00:17:29.289 --> 00:17:29.299 align:start position:0%
what's taking place elsewhere
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
Nationwide the National Association of
 
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
Realtors shows that there's 2.9 months
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
of inventory this was in December
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire we're at 1.3 months
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
so about 40 percent of what it is
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
nationally and if you look at certain
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
counties in the state it's lower than
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
that Hillsboro we're under one month of
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
inventory in the state in December
 
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.350 align:start position:0%
inventory in the state in December
um

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
not every state tracks sort of this uh
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
months of inventory we're about where
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is but if you go to
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania New York New Jersey Texas
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
and other states they're at three
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're about three months significant
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
you know you want to be at that four to
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
six months they can kind of see it we're
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
still a long way from it
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
this next one would be hard to see so I
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
will I will I will email this to you but
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
um I just threw in here some data that
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
we have that's available on our um on
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
our website this is very specific
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
Community data so I picked randomly of
 
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
course Manchester hooks at New Market
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
and Concord
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
um but you'll see that in each of those
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
uh communities
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
from 2021 2022 and 23 2023 median sale
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
price is continuing to increase
 
00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:39.470 align:start position:0%
price is continuing to increase
um

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah now granted in a new market
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the number of closed
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
sales being pretty small but it's still
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
the point is uh the pricing is
 
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.150 align:start position:0%
the point is uh the pricing is
increasing

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
and if you're interested uh in looking
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
at your own Community
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
um we do have this if you go to nhr.org
 
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
something I've called Fast stats you can
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
get all this data uh uh on on on your
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
local community and it shows sort of
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
historically median sale price going
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
back about a decade
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
and this is updated every single month
 
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
so you can come back and and check on it
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
um this is from the National Association
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
of Realtors so uh Dr Lawrence Yoon is
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
the national Economist for for the
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
Realtors and these are sort of his
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
predictions of what's going to happen uh
 
00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
and also a bit of a look back so
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
the I'm not the the best PowerPoint but
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
the the red uh numbers on the home price
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
so nationally for instance in 2019 it
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
saw 4.9 increase in New Hampshire it was
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
six percent
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
2020 it went up 9.1 New Hampshire went
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
up 11.7 16.9 nationally in 2021 17.9 the
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
important thing to remember here is this
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
is always compounding so when there's a
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
little bit of a split in terms of New
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus nationally
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
um as even a one percent as you start
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
you start separating even further and
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
that's what we're seeing New Hampshire
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
is always just above the rest of the
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
country in terms of median sale price
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
and we were again in 2022 actually it
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
was 10 and we were at 11.4 so moving
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
forward they're predicting uh a one
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
percent meaning increase so they're
 
00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:24.539 align:start position:0%
looking at kind of a flat market in
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
terms of uh pricing which is again keep
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
in mind we topped that at about 460 in
 
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
in mind we topped that at about 460 in
2022.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
but then they're looking at 2024 that's
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
starting to accelerate again obviously
 
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
this has impact the interest rates and
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
the larger economy is going to impact
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
this but this is kind of the snapshot
 
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
right now so with that I will turn it
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
over to Chris
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Bob and thank you members of
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
um so as I said before I'm Chris Norwood
 
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
and I focus primarily on Commercial Real
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
Estate which does also include
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
multi-family investment sales
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and what I just we're going to throw
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of data there's obviously a lot of
 
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
data on the PowerPoint I didn't present
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
to PowerPoint so I'm happy to summarize
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
any of this uh in an email
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
um I want to just say what I found
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
interesting in coming to Concord over
 
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
the last number of years in in lobbying
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
what you're hearing now is from
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
employers and we didn't used to hear
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
that it used to be just you know the
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
Realtors the housing Advocates and so
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
forth their employers there are chambers
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
of commerces the Bia and so forth that
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
see this as a huge thing and and I'll
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
let them lend their ear to this
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee uh to see how much employers
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
are looking and this is a this is a
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
Statewide issue
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
um a couple things on data for uh for
 
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.230 align:start position:0%
um a couple things on data for uh for
multi-family

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
multi-family
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
if you were to go back to Bob's slide
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
where he talked about the median price
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
going from 200 000 and then accelerated
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
to 300 000 and then 400 and how quick
 
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
that acceleration is so I'm going to
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
speak specifically to Manchester for
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
multi-family uh sales and that's because
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
the data is the most robust there
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
um you know historically there's about
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
300 or so properties that sell through
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
the MLS of multi-families in Manchester
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
which gives you a pretty good sample
 
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.970 align:start position:0%
which gives you a pretty good sample
size

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
size
 
00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
um and I will say that the majority of
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
the data that that I'm going to talk
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
about right now are the smaller stick
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
built ones I'm not talking about the
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
large 40 to 50 units those are different
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
classifications which I'll mention in a
 
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.409 align:start position:0%
classifications which I'll mention in a
moment

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
the four to say 10 units in the trough
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
of the Great Recession we're selling
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
Thirty to forty thousand dollars per
 
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.529 align:start position:0%
Thirty to forty thousand dollars per
door

00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
just before the pandemic they were
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
starting to sell between 70 and 90 000
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
adore right so you've got maybe it took
 
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
them about eight years to double in
 
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.890 align:start position:0%
them about eight years to double in
price

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:47.900 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
then now
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
2022 if you look at those they're 120 to
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
150 000 a door so it took about three
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
years to almost double again right so
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
the velocity is increasing and I think
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
what Bob said is true the velocity of
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
increase is is a number of things it's
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
the incredibly low interest rate I
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
started this business 20 years ago so I
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
don't know interest rates higher than
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know six and a half percent right
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
when I started 20 years ago
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
um but that would that's been the norm
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
is if you look at the trend line we were
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
in some hyper hyper low interest rates
 
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
we were also in a period the last three
 
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
years of a number of stimulus dollars
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
coming in and a lot of these things just
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
compounded so I I want to just kind of
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
briefly mention that environment and if
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
you are looking on the rental rate side
 
00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.890 align:start position:0%
you are looking on the rental rate side
obviously

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
um the best source of that data and I'm
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
also a board member of the New Hampshire
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority full
 
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.390 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority full
disclosure

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and Ben and um Heather and their team
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
have great data but roughly in the last
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
five years the the cost of a two-bedroom
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
unit has grown by about 30
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
let's call it 30 plus or minus right
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
depending upon how you want to look at
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
it so the overall dollar amount that
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
people are paying for these units is
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
gone up uh but also the rental rates
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
have gone up as well
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh on the on the higher end cost of
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
construction let's talk about that for a
 
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
second because that's part of the
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
problem in my opinion we've gotten to a
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
point where the only type of
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
construction that is Affordable
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
those large-scale construction when you
 
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
drive down 93 you'll see large buildings
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
going up in Londonderry right these
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
large huge complexes and and I think
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
that there's a number of reasons behind
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
this but quite frankly it's economies of
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
scale and I think that that's the
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
largest reason but the price of new
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
construction for what I will call a
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
quality units not B quality like they're
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
in downtowns these a quality are 250 to
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
300 000 and that's an all-in cost
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
including land and what I find
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
interesting about the data when you look
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
at the cost of construction is the value
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
of the land is increasing but it's
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
nominally so so I I what I want the
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
committee to understand that the price
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
is not being driven up by people who
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
have held on to all this land and all of
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
a sudden now they're selling it and
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's really fueling the costs it's the
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
soft cost the legal fees the engineering
 
00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:24.059 align:start position:0%
fees the architectural fees it's the
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
overall cost of construct action and
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
those costs are weighing heavily on
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
development projects and again I think
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
that that's why we're seeing these
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
larger scale projects because the
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
inflection point for construction is at
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
least 40 units to make a go at
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
um at a new project
 
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.630 align:start position:0%
um at a new project
um

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
just staying with that large and small
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
um you know why don't I just go here I I
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave here with a bunch of
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
negative pieces so I just want to
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
consider a couple
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
um areas where I see for for opportunity
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
and I think being in the field one of
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
the things that I see is we need to
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
create incentives for the small and
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
medium-sized contractors and how can we
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
get something that's less than 40 units
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
built because I respect the fact that
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
not every Community wants a hundred unit
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
complex sitting outside of their Main
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
Street and so you know some bills that
 
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
have either that are in this session or
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
previous sessions anything that can
 
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
support increased density particularly
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
where there's already Municipal Water
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
and Sewer and we don't have to concern
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
ourselves we're building excess septic
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
systems I think those are positive
 
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.269 align:start position:0%
systems I think those are positive
things

00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
adus which is something that this body
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
passed a number of years ago that has
 
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
been helpful but something to allow for
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
increased density broadly across the
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
state we see as a positive
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
um and I will I'll leave on this one
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
statistic which is
 
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:57.890 align:start position:0%
statistic which is
um

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
OSI and I believe correct OSI is no
 
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
OSI and I believe correct OSI is no
longer

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
nhbe a now uh tracks this data
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
um but the OSI has been tracking for a
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
number of years the total number of
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
building permits
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
um and if you ever look at the data
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
um and you graph it everyone knows you
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
know Great Recession years and so forth
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
we were at a state producing seven to
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
nine thousand building permits just
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
before the Great Recession
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
by no means am I stating we should go
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
back to over building and we could talk
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
about whether seven to nine thousand was
 
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
over building but then after the Great
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
Recession we didn't break 3 000 for a
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
finally finally in 2000 I think 20 or
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
2021 we got up to five thousand and I
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
think as Bob was talking earlier there
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
is kind of a a there are ranges which we
 
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
should all strive to I think New
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is it needs to be in that four
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
to five thousand building permits per
 
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:03.299 align:start position:0%
year how we get there I want to
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
emphasize there's no silver bullets I
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple bills that that I
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
think I personally think are positive
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
but uh overall we cannot seek a um a
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
silver bullet I think we all have to
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that we're going to have to
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
do a number of different things to
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
encourage development to increase that
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
Supply I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um are there questions from
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.890 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
Mr Quinn you had mentioned that there
 
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
had been a steady decline in the
 
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
inventory of homes for sale in New
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the question that I wanted
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
to ask is do you have any idea why this
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
is so
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
so I think I mean I don't think there's
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
just again there's probably not one
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
answer to that I mean obviously a lot of
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
folks want to come to New Hampshire
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
um it's we've seen although it's
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
happening now in Maine and Vermont as
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
well there's been more of an influx into
 
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
the state than you've seen in other
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
parts certainly of New England where
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
there maybe has been an outflow of of
 
00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:09.310 align:start position:0%
there maybe has been an outflow of of
population

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
but clearly I think it gets to Chris's
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
point which post recession the number of
 
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
permits that were being issued were
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily low so we weren't
 
00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:22.700 align:start position:0%
building enough homes units apartments
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
in order to satisfy the demand and I
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
think that's you know the simple part of
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
it you know and
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
we kind of believe if the legislature
 
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.330 align:start position:0%
we kind of believe if the legislature
empowers

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
empowers
 
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
empowers
um

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
the individual the private property
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
owner to utilize their property in a
 
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:43.580 align:start position:0%
manner that they feel is of best use
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
then a lot of this inventory issue
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
will subside over time it's oftentimes
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
When government local governments
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
especially kind of get involved it can
 
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
really increase dramatically the price
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
of of construction and in some ways
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
limit the ability of that property owner
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
to provide the necessary units the state
 
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
needs representative
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
um in in your discussions about the
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
selling price
 
00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:17.750 align:start position:0%
selling price
um

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
you're you are essentially
 
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
I think kind of grouping everything
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
together do you have any data as far as
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
like dollar per square foot if that is
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
going up or a dollar per acre
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.430 align:start position:0%
um as far as
um

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
maybe I guess that would that would help
 
00:30:38.649 --> 00:30:38.659 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:30:41.889 --> 00:30:41.899 align:start position:0%
what types of buildings maybe
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
you know is this
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
a building that was previously one
 
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and is Tiny and
 
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
now it's four hundred thousand dollars
 
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
that's being sold or are we just
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
building giant buildings and not
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
building small buildings that would
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
would possibly bring this number down is
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
kind of what I'm
 
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
um if you but you know if you built a
 
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
smaller building that was a hundred and
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars that might bring
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
the average down whereas if we're
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
building all four hundred thousand
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
dollar houses then obviously the the
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
median is going to be above four hundred
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
thousand right and so that information
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
and if I could one not statistics but
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we are building more and
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
more studios in more and more really
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
efficiencies you know 500-ish square
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
feet and
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
um we're no longer building as many two
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
three and four bedroom units and we can
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
talk about motivations behind that but I
 
00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
mean I know my first plate crash pad out
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
of college was a three bedroom unit we
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
split it three ways
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
um but now you have an efficiency which
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
cost you know that same price point
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
um but the newer construction or the new
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
trend in multi-family tends to be uh
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
smaller smaller units
 
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
and then just to go to your your point I
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
think the key I think we would want to
 
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:03.539 align:start position:0%
underscore is the need for more density
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
um so whether or not that's multi-family
 
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
or it's single-family homes a
 
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
subdivision uh developers can build more
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
densely it's good for the developer and
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's also good for the the potential
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
renter or buyer because they can do
 
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
things at a more affordable price
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
density great represent representative
 
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
McConkey after
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I appreciate
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
the presentation today I think it's very
 
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.210 align:start position:0%
the presentation today I think it's very
informative

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
informative
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
um on a more Cosmic level Beyond
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
um just identifying the problem but
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
justifying fixing the problem
 
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
in the legislature especially in last
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
year with a couple of the four Flex
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
bills one of the arguments that I heard
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
made from the floor of the house was
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
well a lot of us in the legislature have
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
invested our time and money over the
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
years and now our home value has gone up
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
and we are concerned that passing this
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
four Plex bill will decrease the value
 
00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
of those homes and it seems that one of
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
the major roadblocks to addressing this
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
very important problem is the fact that
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
some folks will see
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
a threat in a decrease of the value of
 
00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:12.059 align:start position:0%
their homes so I'm kind of curious as to
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
what the elevator pitch is from the New
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Realtors association as far as
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the justification for not just
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
identifying the problem but why it's
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
specifically to that bill representative
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
but I think in general
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
um our communities Thrive when there are
 
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
people moving in and I think that we in
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we've been fortunate even
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
though we've had a declining birth rate
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
declining School population for about
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
two decades now
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
um we've we've been the beneficiary of
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
net in migration and I think the
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
challenge that I see generally for all
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
housing bills is if we stop seeing that
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
net in migration if we stop giving
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to come in and
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh grow and have kids
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
um those are the people that make the
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
community Thrive those are the people
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
working those are the people spending
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
money at the local coffee shops
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
um and so I I think that perhaps again
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
not specifically to that bill but I see
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
any sort of increase in the number of
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
homes being built in a community or or a
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
denser apartment building being built in
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
an urban environment I see that as money
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
that is going to help the beauty Salon
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
the coffee shop
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
the et cetera et cetera so I see it as
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
any other questions represent McConkey
 
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.690 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
um for Mr Norwood they you spoke of um
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
in the Manchester area that uh
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
multi-family four to five units I think
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
you were speaking four to ten units you
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
used a number of the selling price or
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
buying price right now to be somewhere
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
between 120 150 a door I understand that
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
do you have any data that tells you as
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
you move north of Concord where that
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
number is at a 10 20 percent less do you
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
have any data like that please I can
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
grab that data and I think the Bob said
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
it earlier is
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
um the data becomes thinner so it's I I
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
just want to be cautious that we don't
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
try and make any conclusions off of one
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
property that could skew it but we
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
certainly can look up that data and Mr
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
chairman uh if we could just ask that
 
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.450 align:start position:0%
chairman uh if we could just ask that
the

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
that the presentation be sent to you and
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
then distributed us if you would please
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
that'd be great thank you representative
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chair and my
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
question is for Chris
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
um in order to sort of like work around
 
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.410 align:start position:0%
um in order to sort of like work around
the

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.390 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
the desire of
 
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.930 align:start position:0%
the desire of
towns

00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
to keep the density um low would it be
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
possible to do a sort of like I say a
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
100 unit scattered site project to beat
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
the density conundrum and does that work
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
with economies of scale in mind so I'm
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
thinking about
um

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
faced like phase construction for
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
instance um a developer buys five
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
Parcels in a town
 
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:29.099 align:start position:0%
um and then you know of course they
 
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
scattered in different areas so
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
would it be feasible to develop 100
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
units phasing in
 
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.609 align:start position:0%
units phasing in
um

00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
the project and representative thank you
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
for the question and it is a a personal
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
passion of mine to figure out that
 
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.670 align:start position:0%
passion of mine to figure out that
riddle

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
riddle
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
um there are challenges broadly speaking
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of engineering uh needing
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
multiple driveways driveways that you
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
can get a fire truck through right so
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not just
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
um aesthetic issues there are life
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
safety concerns for scattered sites as
 
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.990 align:start position:0%
safety concerns for scattered sites as
well

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
um but I I understand and I do think
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
um that should be part of the solution
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
and whether or not it's a large
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
developer putting in three sites
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout a neighborhood or
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
whether that is a smaller person who
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
somehow we can make the economies work
 
00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:26.540 align:start position:0%
to put up a 12 unit that may not be as
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
offensive perhaps to other questions
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
um in the community may be more positive
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.339 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up on representative De
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo's question
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with the use of
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
scattered site development
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
um in federally funded housing
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
um I should tell you I'm a 29-year
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
employee of the U.S Department of
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development and
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
um was involved with many uh
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
developments of various types of federal
 
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
funding and Scattered site
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
scattered site development became more
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
and more common over the years that I
 
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
worked there and has been done
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
successfully in many places throughout
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
New England
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative let's connect after this
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
because that's that's awesome to hear
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
and I'm not as familiar with that no I'd
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
like to learn more
 
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:30.859 align:start position:0%
um speaking of more scattered
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
decentralized methods of getting to
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
increase Supply I heard you say probably
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
my current three favorite letters which
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
is Adu
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
and for full disclosure I'm the prime
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the Adu bill
 
00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:45.770 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the Adu bill
um

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yes accessory dwelling
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
units currently I think the year before
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
I was elected a bill passed to allow
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
every homeowner occupied owner occupied
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
homeowner to build one accessory
 
00:38:59.810 --> 00:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
um towns were allowed to have certain
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
restrictions on them but they would have
 
00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:05.339 align:start position:0%
it by right I'm in Greece I have in my
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
bill proposed to increase that to two
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
with certain other restrictions in place
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
so sorry for the background uh so my
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
question is um because it seems that you
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
kind of support this but the committee
 
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
recently it yelled it uh on what I
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
believe to be misunderstandings of the
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
situation one of the things they said
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
was they were afraid well I heard after
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that they were worried about
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
um property values and is it your
 
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:37.700 align:start position:0%
experience places that have built adus
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
somehow decreased the neighborhood
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
property values at all
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
to kind of reference representative
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
adjectives question
 
00:39:45.599 --> 00:39:46.790 align:start position:0%
adjectives question
so

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
um we are not appraisers so it may be a
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
good idea to bring in an appraiser at
 
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
some point however I've talked to a
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
praise about this issue because it comes
 
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
up quite a bit
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
there was a tiny home built a couple of
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
years ago same organ was made
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I talk to appraisers and they could
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
they were like listen you can't make
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
that judgment
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
um on a global scale you'd have to know
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what's the neighborhood is what
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
it looks like but they said generally
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be a factor as
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're appraising a property so yeah we
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't certainly
 
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
um find that to be
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up very briefly if
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
the chair would allow it
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
um so obviously usually it increases the
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
actual that actual property value of
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
that property that has more because and
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
it helps home buyers buy homes because
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
if you have rental income inherent in
 
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
your property you can afford your
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
mortgage more easily but in terms you're
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
saying in terms of the neighborhood
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
values it doesn't there's no reason to
 
00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:44.579 align:start position:0%
expect especially in the trickle way
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
that adus would be built not a wave but
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you and I would I would
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
just point out also on the Adu issue
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
um an example just talking to somebody
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
so they're developing an Adu in
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
Manchester their mother is going to
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
leave her home in Manchester and move
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
into the Adu now her mother's home is
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
going to be available for someone to
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
move in
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
all right the value of his home is going
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
to increase he's going to end up paying
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
more in property taxes for that so the
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
city is going to benefit nobody is
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
utilizing any Services more than they
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
were before so it's a great opportunity
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
um uh for that type of activity what we
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
always say is sort of a we we want to
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
see everything everything above the line
 
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
anything you can think of helps because
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is your people
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
are moving around you can't it's very
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
challenging to build a single family
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
home it doesn't really matter what size
 
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:39.500 align:start position:0%
it is just because of all of the the the
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
soft costing that's going to be less
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
than five hundred thousand dollars but
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
don't look at that as being necessarily
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
a bad thing because a first-time
 
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
homebuyer can't afford it someone who
 
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
was in a 300 000 house currently is
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to move into that 500 000 home and
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
that frees up their 300 000 home right
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe that person is buying a 300
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
000 home was in an apartment now their
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
apartment's going to be available
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
so the more
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
housing we have period it's going to
 
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
start alleviating some of these issues
 
00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:11.579 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of a everything everything
 
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
um you
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
I guess it's possible you don't know but
 
00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:22.490 align:start position:0%
I guess it's possible you don't know but
um

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh the adus
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
have been around for for a number of
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
years have you seen
 
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.770 align:start position:0%
years have you seen
um

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.150 align:start position:0%
um
issues

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
with maybe people that want to to put in
 
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
adus and are not able to is is there is
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
there demand I guess for uh for houses
 
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099 align:start position:0%
with adus already built have you seen
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
any kind of like desire to see that uh
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
and and is there any struggles that you
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
know about
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
um or maybe
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
um people that we should talk to as far
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
as as struggles that um about
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
implementing those
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
I think as far as adu's and we certainly
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh I can think of a couple stories but
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
one in particular where it's not a slam
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
dunk to get an Adu so just because we
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
have now a bill previously passed that
 
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
said you know you can build an Adu on
 
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
your residence doesn't mean that you can
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
just go in tomorrow and just start
 
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.970 align:start position:0%
just go in tomorrow and just start
building

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
um and and oftentimes there's a lot of
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment that exists
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
within the town or the city that can be
 
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
daunting and can take months so whether
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
or not this body should start creating a
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
a fast lane so to speak for that that
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
that's maybe another policy type
 
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
question but I will say that it's uh
 
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's not just um just because we passed
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
that bill a number of years ago doesn't
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
mean that you can go out tomorrow and
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
put up an edu towns still do have
 
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.710 align:start position:0%
put up an edu towns still do have
authority

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that the adus you know
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
have size restrictions and so forth
 
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.550 align:start position:0%
have size restrictions and so forth
representative

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
um the first one I have two actually if
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
it's okay first one goes to cost and I
 
00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
saw some of the graphs from this
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
distance showing the spike in in
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
building cost of forfeit well I mean the
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
the the sale cost right now
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
let me what was the fact the effect or
 
00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:20.660 align:start position:0%
do you have any statistics to show
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise how much the cost of
 
00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:25.339 align:start position:0%
building materials affected
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
the total costs only because I'm in the
 
00:44:29.089 --> 00:44:29.099 align:start position:0%
business and I know everything
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
quadrupled basically
 
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
um and so that head will have a bearing
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you know how much of a
 
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.569 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you know how much of a
bearing

00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
bearing
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
and then a similar follow-up to it is
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
now that things have settled down to
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
about maybe 10 percent more than they
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
were pre-covered do you see the price
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
maybe trending down again
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually going to look and maybe
 
00:44:52.809 --> 00:44:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think you're going to get a
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
good Insight on the construction cost
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
from folks that are building they can
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
probably answer the question better than
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
I okay and if I can't this one is
 
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
probably for them uh you mentioned the
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
healthy amount of building permits uh
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
do you have any data that shows it
 
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.589 align:start position:0%
do you have any data that shows it
regionally

00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
regionally
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
um town by Town even possibly only
 
00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
because I read an article somewhere
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
before I knew I was going to be on this
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
committee that a lot of the towns in
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire have actually
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
increased their inventory from two to
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
three hundred percent but it was
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
actually the municipalities the larger
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
towns that were only growing at about 40
 
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.770 align:start position:0%
towns that were only growing at about 40
percent

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
so it'd be neat to see if we could just
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
look at it regionally
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
so uh this used to be the office of
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives who put out this
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
now it's New Hampshire Bea who I see
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
behind me
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
um so they can give you uh sort of an
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
update on that I I think that it does
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
get to a point though and another issue
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
as you're thinking about a public policy
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh position moving forward is we see
 
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
certain communities which are working
 
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
diligently to expand permitting and
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
increase the inventory of housing we see
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
other communities who are not
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
um as open to that who might be
 
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
neighboring so we talk about local
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
control it we all want local control we
 
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
all respect the need for it but at times
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
there also has to be recognition that
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes one Town's local control
 
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
starts to negatively impact a
 
00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
neighboring Town's local control and
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
we've seen that in a number of
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
communities across the state
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
um so it's something also to consider as
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're moving forward with Solutions
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you and Owen if you could send
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
that over to us or no I'm sorry no if
 
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
you can send that over to us that'd be
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy okay thank you Mr
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um finally
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing has been so much is
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
um we see a lot of out-of-state buyers
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
coming in do you have any numbers of
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
people from out of state coming in and
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
where they're coming in from so
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
representative baruti actually wrote
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New Hampshire on the top
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
of my page because I did want to say
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
that that was mentioned earlier
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
um we do not but I know that Ben and
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
Heather from New Hampshire Housing
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
Finance did do a study and they looked
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
at 21 over 20 2020 I don't know if they
 
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
have 22 over 21 yet but um listen I
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
drive by an open house all I see are
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts plates at least that's
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
what I think I see right but but the
 
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
reality is is when we look at the data
 
00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:24.140 align:start position:0%
um there is there has been an increase
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
it was as I recall a two to three
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
percent increase of overall out-of-state
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
buyers not just Massachusetts let's not
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
just pick on them
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
um and so it is an increase but it's not
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
as dramatic Statewide locally Rockingham
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
County Hillsborough County I think that
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
there we need to do look at the data a
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
little bit more narrowly but it's
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts isn't the only one to
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
blame for our problem
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah I do believe New Hampshire
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
housing does have that data okay thank
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
you awesome um representative Reed thank
 
00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.790 align:start position:0%
you awesome um representative Reed thank
you

00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
um once again so I want to kind of I
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't think you'll have this information
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you anyway
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
um because when we talk about oh out of
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
state buyers there's this like kind of
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
negative like oh no but we also at the
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
same time talk all the time about trying
 
00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
to attract more young people to the
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
state that means out of state buyers so
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
do you have data on what percentage of
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
those people might be younger
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
question uh the data that I believe was
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
collected and talked to Ben and Heather
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
but I believe it was based upon the
 
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds information and where
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
they're in outbound deed and their
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
inbound deed was those types of things
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't capture their age or
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
any other demographic profile
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you great does anyone else can we
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
have questions
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you very
 
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.370 align:start position:0%

answer that question we have someone

patched in from Florida which I think is
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
just going to be on this computer so I
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
think we should be self-sufficient there
 
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.809 align:start position:0%
think we should be self-sufficient there
okay

00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:23.819 --> 00:51:25.190 align:start position:0%
okay

headquarters there that's true
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
um we are a vertically integrated Real
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
Estate Investment Company
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
so what that means is we have about 85
 
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.210 align:start position:0%
so what that means is we have about 85
employees

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
we do our own construction our own
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
property management our own property
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
maintenance we have a brokerage meaning
 
00:51:55.329 --> 00:51:55.339 align:start position:0%
a real estate brokerage arm and
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
currently we own and operate about 1 500
 
00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.010 align:start position:0%
currently we own and operate about 1 500
Apartments

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
Apartments
 
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
those are our own apartments and we also
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
do third party Property Management
 
00:52:10.089 --> 00:52:10.099 align:start position:0%
the majority are our own Apartments
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
of those apartments that we do we do
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
both market rate Apartments
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
in affordable apartments and so by
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
definition market rate means there's no
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions to the rents on that are
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
able to be had there just with the
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
market commands and affordable means
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
that there is a ceiling on you know the
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
amount of rent that we can charge
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
um historically we have done
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
um what are called flips we've bought
 
00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:41.900 align:start position:0%
renovated and resold over 400
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and over 65
 
00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.370 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and over 65
communities

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:45.380 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've built ground up single-family
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
homes so that is not something that we
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
do now historically we've done a lot of
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
renovation of pre-existing distressed
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
properties but in addition to that now
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're also building out of the ground
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
including low-income housing tax credit
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
projects one of which is in Salem New
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're building 74 Apartments
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
out of the ground now
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
um we are converting 96 Apartments in
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
Rochester New Hampshire from market rate
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
to Affordable those were built in 1987
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
we're converting those and working to
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
develop another two or three hundred
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
units out of the ground via permitting
 
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
in Rochester New Hampshire so that's
 
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
kind of a broad brush of the types of
 
00:53:30.849 --> 00:53:30.859 align:start position:0%
things that we get into and
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative barood who said for me to
 
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
bring in some materials I'll pass around
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
a little brochure that we had put
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
together when we renovated some property
 
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:44.099 align:start position:0%
here in Concord back in 2017.
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just pass that around but I'm
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
going to pass it off to my partner Matt
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
minning who is our director of
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
operations and head of operations and
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
and head of property management thank
 
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.790 align:start position:0%
and head of property management thank

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to come up
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
and thanks for inviting us
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Broody
 
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.450 align:start position:0%
representative Broody
um

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
we hope that today we don't have a slide
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
deck and a big presentation I want to
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
talk at you for an hour and a half uh
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
would be just more of a discussion and
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've also invited which I'll reveal in
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
a second uh Stephen Lewis uh he is
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get into retirement and is
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
almost there so he's joining us from
 
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.490 align:start position:0%
almost there so he's joining us from
Florida

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
um Stephen is a very seasoned developer
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the state we've been working with him
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
closely over the past couple of years on
 
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.589 align:start position:0%
closely over the past couple of years on
our

00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
affordable development management and so
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
we felt that inviting him
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
to join us today would really augment
 
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
the presentation and discussion Steve
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
has had a lot of
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of experience in multiple
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
communities with planning boards zoning
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
boards working with New Hampshire
 
00:55:01.619 --> 00:55:02.809 align:start position:0%
boards working with New Hampshire
housing

00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
dating back to the 1980s and he's
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
developed I'll let Steve
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
discussed that but he's done dozens of
 
00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:13.460 align:start position:0%
projects maybe maybe hundreds we'll see
 
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:17.220 align:start position:0%
but he's very very experienced and uh
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
the way I think we would organize maybe
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
and you tell us if this works but start
 
00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
at the at the first part of the
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
development phase Land Development
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
permitting entitlement
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
then move into the financing
 
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
underwriting construction and finally
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
the lease up management and ongoing
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
compliance especially as it relates to
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
the low income housing tax credit
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
programs I think that sounds great and I
 
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.210 align:start position:0%
programs I think that sounds great and I
think

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
um specifically maybe outline some of
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
the roadblocks that you'd run into at
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
each step of the process too would be
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
great for the committee perfect so I
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
think with that I'll probably Steve turn
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
you around here and make sure everyone
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
can hear you can you hear us Steve
 
00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
yeah let me turn you so you can face the
 
00:56:02.819 --> 00:56:08.690 align:start position:0%
yeah let me turn you so you can face the
committee

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
uh can you everyone hear Steve all right
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
all right how about now
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
all right so Steve if you want to
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself a little bit and uh
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
you can start off with the Land
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
Development Area
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
well I think to begin with I'm not a
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
stranger to being in in front of the
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
legislature and testifying on housing
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
issues uh more closely with Elliot Berry
 
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire legal
 
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
ization which may seem like a strange
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
marriage but housing is not a partisan
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
issue housing is not a left or a right
 
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.430 align:start position:0%
issue housing is not a left or a right
issue

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I think uh one of the things that's
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
important for you to know is that I'm an
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
endangered specie because I'm actually
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire native who still lives
 
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
in the community he was born in
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm past president of New Hampshire
 
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
hotels Association so
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of a background and don't
 
00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
hold it against me I did work for the
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Commerce for three years
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
please don't hold that one against me
 
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
um but basically I think it's important
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
to know that I have been involved in the
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
affordable housing industry uh since
 
00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.930 align:start position:0%
affordable housing industry uh since
1980

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
1980
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
I started in the building business in
 
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.010 align:start position:0%
I started in the building business in
1972.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
1972.
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh yes I am older than dirt
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
um but interestingly I got involved in
 
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
the affordable side of it when I was
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
accosted by a former school teacher
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
complaining why she was forced to move
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
out of the community she had lived in
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
all her life now that she was retired
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
and she blamed me the Builder for not
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
producing affordable housing and when I
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
told her I'm not allowed to build
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
affordable housing she thought I was
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
coming up with an excuse
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
and I think this story is interesting uh
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
back at that point there was a New
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Commission which uh I
 
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:17.780 align:start position:0%
hardly suggest that you might think of
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
re-upping again because the New
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing commission's entire
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
sole Focus was housing advocacy and
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
making sure that local communities just
 
00:58:31.809 --> 00:58:31.819 align:start position:0%
follow New Hampshire's
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional law
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
and I invited them to come to a planning
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
board meeting
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
and I said I would propose an affordable
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
senior housing project and I wanted them
 
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
to see what would happen so the New
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing uh the director of New
 
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:50.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing
 
00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.250 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing
Commission

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
and Dolores desotel from HUD and the
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
school teacher went to a planning board
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
meeting and they said why are you
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
proposing this you know Ms Lewis we
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't allow it I said well I would just
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
like to know what your feelings are
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
about providing affordable senior
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
housing in this community and they went
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
around the room and they said we don't
 
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
want those kind of people in our
 
00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.870 align:start position:0%
want those kind of people in our
community

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
now if I had said I don't want to build
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
units for those kind of people I would
 
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
violate the federal fair housing unit
 
00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.650 align:start position:0%
violate the federal fair housing unit
so

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
um if you want to know the roadblocks
 
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
that was 26 years ago and
 
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's still out there and unfortunately
 
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
it's more of a lack of information
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
I think there are people that have
 
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about the effects of
 
00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:48.140 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in a community
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
I think uh this is not an isolated
 
00:59:53.579 --> 00:59:54.770 align:start position:0%
I think uh this is not an isolated
example

00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:57.710 align:start position:0%
uh but
um

00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
that meeting resulted in a four-year
 
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
class action lawsuit
 
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
and we actually proved that the ton of
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
Atkinson literally discriminated against
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
low and middle income people by their
 
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
zoning practices
 
01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.210 align:start position:0%
zoning practices
and

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:14.930 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
I know that sounds harsh but it was the
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
best thing that happened if you ask
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
people in Atkinson now
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
this guy didn't fall Chicken Little was
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
wrong Atkinson has balanced housing and
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
we have one of the lowest tax rates in
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County
 
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
so that's just the background
 
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.549 align:start position:0%
so that's just the background
um

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
there are there are I'm here to answer
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions about what you can do in a
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
positive way but after that lawsuit
 
01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.829 align:start position:0%
positive way but after that lawsuit
um

01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
I had built a very successful project
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
um senior project in Atkinson I built a
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
very successful projects in uh Salem New
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am now being approached by
 
01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am now being approached by
communities

01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Lewis would you
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
do a project here because we know
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
um it will be done and we won't get sued
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of respect and fear produce
 
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
a similar result
 
01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:14.809 align:start position:0%
a similar result
um

01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are some things that I if you
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
would like I can send you there's an
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
independent study done by Bruce Mayberry
 
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
um commissioned by New Hampshire
 
01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.150 align:start position:0%
um commissioned by New Hampshire
Authority

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
um it is a two-year study on the effects
 
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
of affordable housing on a community he
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
studied all the low-income housing tax
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
credit projects that have been built in
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
the last 10 to 12 years that is a very
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
important study because it's an
 
01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:46.460 align:start position:0%
independent third-party study and it
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
smashes the myths many communities have
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
about the negative effects of horrible
 
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:53.339 align:start position:0%
housing because that's the biggest
 
01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
problem in the state
 
01:01:59.049 --> 01:01:59.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
a prejudice against
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
those kind of people has been said to me
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
more than once unfortunately
 
01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.609 align:start position:0%
more than once unfortunately
so

01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:12.500 align:start position:0%
I won't go into any more
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
stories but I think attitude impacts a
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
housing crisis so when somebody says why
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire have a housing
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
shortage it is completely man-made
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that this committee has heard
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
that message before we're probably just
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
trying to reinforce that um it the the
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
difference between different
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities and how they approach
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
housing whether it's affordable or
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
market rate single family is very very
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
different you have towns that are very
 
01:02:47.049 --> 01:02:47.059 align:start position:0%
supportive that are very open to
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
facilitating the process and we have
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
towns that are very against it to the
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
point of
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
discrimination right um right the is the
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee aware of the I think it was a
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
year or two ago that Josiah Bartlett did
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
a center to study on the impact of
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
different zoning
 
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
regulations throughout the state if not
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
we could follow up with that as well and
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
we have another
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
um presentation later today specifically
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
on zoning there's some new research out
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire zoning okay good yeah
 
01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
that's I in terms of obstacles
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's one of the biggest and you and
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
from a developer's standpoint
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
you are either faced with the decision
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
that Steve had of starting a lawsuit to
 
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
try to move a project forward or just
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
not doing business in that town and then
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
that town doesn't have housing built so
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
you've got a fraction then of the state
 
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's really kind of
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
open for business to build to build new
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
housing and the way they do it is you'll
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
learn a lot more I'm sure uh setbacks uh
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
minimum uh lot sizes density
 
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.390 align:start position:0%
minimum uh lot sizes density
restrictions

01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
many many barriers to building the type
 
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:57.770 align:start position:0%
many many barriers to building the type
of

01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
property that can be built in an
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
affordable fashion right density is huge
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
if you need to have a 50 Acre Site to
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
build 50 units
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
the land costs make it a non-starter
 
01:04:09.059 --> 01:04:10.130 align:start position:0%
the land costs make it a non-starter
immediately

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
um if you even get the approval in the
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
first place right there's many other
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
ways that planning boards can slow down
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
the process that's another big big
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
problem is the time it takes Steve I
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know if you have any
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
stories of
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
the longest and the shortest time it's
 
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
taken to get permits and entitlement but
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's minimum a year and a half in my
 
01:04:33.599 --> 01:04:37.250 align:start position:0%
it's minimum a year and a half in my
experience

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
it's a year and a half but one of the
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
things that Toms have done and sort of
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
there's no we're providing for
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
holding the number of units for building
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about increasing density
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
but when a community sends you if you
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
want to do affordable housing they have
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
to be uh and duplex of quadruplex there
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
is no a that you can create an
 
01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
affordable housing unit without shared
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
economies of you know
 
01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
units being stacked together so that's
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
one of the classic
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
things that can be communities restrict
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
the number of units per building
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
and there are so many
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
unique and positive ways to build
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
affordable housing without destroying if
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
I hear one more time the rural character
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
of a community well
 
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
traditional New England communities had
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
all forms of affordability in housing
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's only in the recent in the 20 years
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
with the influx of new people
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
well I was supposedly coming to New
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the New Hampshire Spirit
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
have changed it through these
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
exclusionary practices
 
01:05:52.619 --> 01:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
exclusionary practices
but

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.250 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
there are there I think it would be good
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
to invite uh communities who have worked
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
on and developed successful affordable
 
01:06:07.809 --> 01:06:07.819 align:start position:0%
housing overlay zoning
 
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
that can prove that it's not
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
wall-to-ball Apartments I know that um
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
in Londonderry the former Town manager
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
Kevin Smith
 
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
came up with a unique way of doing it I
 
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
know Ross Waldorf Salem's Town planner
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
sat down and we worked together they
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
gotta they got a grant from New
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority to
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
develop an overlay for workless housing
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
I think those experiences might be
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
helpful and I'm sure they would be
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
willing to come and share how they did
 
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:45.170 align:start position:0%
willing to come and share how they did
it

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
represent broody thank you Mr chairman
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
um we can't help with local zoning and
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
planning the boards too
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
we um
 
01:06:55.859 --> 01:06:57.349 align:start position:0%
we um
yeah

01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
we were we were formed to
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
study this problem and see if there's
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
something we can do on a state level to
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
help you to help the process along
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
you know like we don't have home rule
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
here but I think we can pass something
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
down the line that might be able to help
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
and we're looking to you for
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
the problem you think we can fix
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
is there any that was not okay
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
01:07:32.579 --> 01:07:33.890 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
chairman

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
um uh Steve um I was very impressed by
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
your story about
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
um uh being able to uh resolve the
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
problems in terms of developing
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
affordable senior housing
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
um as we all know it is much more
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to develop
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
um affordable family housing than even
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
than it is to develop affordable senior
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
housing and I wonder if you have any
 
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
stories that are relevant to uh efforts
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
to develop affordable affordable family
 
01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.049 align:start position:0%
to develop affordable affordable family
housing

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes well first
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for bringing that up
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
um I started with affordable senior
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
housing because I was accosted by a
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
school teacher who was mad at me for not
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
doing affordable senior housing but I
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
have I grew up for
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
me to know that I lived in a house that
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
had no sense of no Central Plumbing and
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
so when I talked to these pompous plenty
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
board members sometimes I guess I'm one
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
of those kind of people but I have made
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
it as I got older my give back is I do
 
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
not do a project unless 50 of the units
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
are Workforce and I found communities
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
willing to negotiate that and and say
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to allow you
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
at 20 density increase
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
and you do it in a planned unit
 
01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.209 align:start position:0%
and you do it in a planned unit
development

01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
that you can't see from the road at
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
least 50 percent of the affordable units
 
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
must be family
 
01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and it's worked it's worked in in
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
Salem it's it's working in other
 
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
communities uh that I
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
worked in uh but it's a negotiation your
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
committee on what the state can do
 
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
if the state would just enforce its
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
existing we don't need any new laws
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
towns are violating
 
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
the laws towns are violating New
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Constitution
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh um I know you don't want a whole
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
bunch of printed stuff but I would I
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
would like to send you the study but I'd
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
also like to send you the Master's
 
01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:42.349 align:start position:0%
also like to send you the Master's
report

01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
on our discrimination lawsuit that's
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
quotes New Hampshire's Constitution
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
section by section pointing out that the
 
01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:53.900 align:start position:0%
free flow of people between communities
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
is a right under New Hampshire's
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution and communities Matt had
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned how one Community will block
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
it and what happens it's unfair to the
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
other communities that are allowing it
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
because they are dumped on Dairy is a
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
perfect example of a community which
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
allowed multi-family in all the uh
 
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
bedroom communities around it said go
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
live in Dairy Atkinson used to say go
 
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
live in Haverhill Mass so that
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
social engineering and Community is
 
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
against the law and unconstitution
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
do you get help by
 
01:10:36.169 --> 01:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
creating a an authority that doesn't
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
depend on
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
um money that there's someone out there
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
that's independent objective that looks
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
into communities for violating Law
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
Without something having to sue I'm glad
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
there's a housing board of appeals but
 
01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
there should be a process where you
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to get Equity by suing
 
01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:58.970 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to get Equity by suing
someone

01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
you really should look at
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
reconstituting the New Hampshire Housing
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
Commission it wasn't an expensive I
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
think it had at the most two or three
 
01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.050 align:start position:0%
think it had at the most two or three
employees

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
and it was independent
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's something you could look into
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
I would I would really Echo Steve's
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
it would help
 
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
Authority which was given that task 20
 
01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
years ago they're busy trying to loan
 
01:11:32.219 --> 01:11:33.110 align:start position:0%
years ago they're busy trying to loan
out

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
money to create affordable housing they
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the time to do the advocacy
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
and they're also a little concerned they
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to irritate
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh someone in the legislature and then
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
they might get less money for next
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
year's affordable housing so it really
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
is a unique
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
job in most States
 
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
have a separate housing commission for
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
that reason uh to make it independent
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
um that would it would be there are
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
plenty more members that just want to
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
know what to do that's right and it
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
would be nice if there was a state
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
agency that was there
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
with their sole responsibility uh I I
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
would like to send you the Master's
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
report because he's done all your
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
homework he analyzed what was wrong with
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh local communities exclusionary Zone
 
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
and he pointed out where they violate
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law and that lawsuit
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
changed zoning in our area
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
but it was in the southern part of the
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
state where exclusionary zoning started
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Stephen representative Gibbs
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I would be very grateful to
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
receive a copy of that study uh on the
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
effect of inclusionary zoning
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
I I will send both of those uh I'm sure
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
Matt just get me who would like them and
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'll email them I have them
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
electronically if you can send that to
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
the entire committee that would be great
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Lewis thank you um representative
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
we'll help facilitate that all right
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
question I'm one of those pompous
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
planning board people
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh the study that you are going to
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
provide I'll ask the same question I did
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
before is there any data out there from
 
01:13:24.729 --> 01:13:24.739 align:start position:0%
anybody that can look at what you call
 
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
balanced housing and Which towns have
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
the study that I'm referring to shows
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
the uh effects of affordable housing on
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
communities they don't we did we didn't
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
point fingers we didn't name who abused
 
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
it we just demonstrated so people can
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
see that the affordable housing doesn't
 
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
lower property values doesn't create
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
traffic problems you would you would be
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
I was even surprised at the density in
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
these projects how many school children
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
they produce that's important
 
01:14:06.729 --> 01:14:06.739 align:start position:0%
information that is many times
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
misconstrued or intentionally
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
misconstrued I've had that happen uh
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
where they're saying this Workforce
 
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
housing project is going to cause
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
40 children in the school system and the
 
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:24.380 align:start position:0%
best source of statistical information
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
are the existing projects in New
 
01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing projects
 
01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:32.810 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing projects
um

01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
per capita per unit how many
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
children do you think are in a typical
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing building
 
01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
per unit
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to have the committee
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
answer that question I'd I'd just like
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
you to let us know if you could
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
per unit is 1.25
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the number of children School
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
children and an average building of 30
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
units is about three
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
not what you would say
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
and that's because the average occupancy
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
in a workplace housing project is a
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
single parent with hi
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
or believe it or not a divorced person
 
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
with no children who is working in the
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
local restaurant or working at Walmart
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh and that's another misconception
 
01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
workplus housing people have to work
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
they have to have a
 
01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.410 align:start position:0%
they have to have a
um

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
background check they have to have a
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
credit check so there's a misconception
 
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:44.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:46.510 align:start position:0%
 
socialized

01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
socialized
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
subsidized people sitting on the front
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
step all day long it's just not true if
 
01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:55.580 align:start position:0%
I may add to that uh
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
the I think the misconception comes from
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
another form of affordable housing which
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
is project-based Section 8 housing which
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
is subsidized rent and and in those
 
01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
cases I think the stigma may be more
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
accurate and you don't see a lot of
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
those projects being started these days
 
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
the low income housing tax credit
 
01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.390 align:start position:0%
the low income housing tax credit
program

01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
restricts the rent but the the resident
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
still is expected to have income and to
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
pay that rent rather than having a
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
subsidized okay representative Walsh
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair for the
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up I guess I'm still trying to
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
get the question answered are there any
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
studies out there by anybody whether
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's the planning commissions
 
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
that actually can show you what each
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
town has in housing type inventories
 
01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's the answer that's the question
 
01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
it's either a yes or no I would have to
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
check and Steve you may know but I
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
believe that the the Bartlett study may
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
have Dr right right so when we say that
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
I believe that's in there
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost is presenting today at um 1
 
01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.649 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost is presenting today at um 1
30.

01:17:11.649 --> 01:17:11.659 align:start position:0%
30.
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
there's a good person to ask
 
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
because he's not only a lawyer don't
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
hold that against him he's also a degree
 
01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:22.580 align:start position:0%
planner and he used to
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh director of the New Hampshire
 
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.649 align:start position:0%
uh director of the New Hampshire
um

01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:27.659 --> 01:17:28.850 align:start position:0%
um
office

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
estate plan so he has been in this and
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
he's a planning board member
 
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
he would he would be an enormously
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
positive source for statistical
 
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.850 align:start position:0%
positive source for statistical
information

01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:44.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs and then
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh just in
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
um Section 8 housing
 
01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.189 align:start position:0%
um Section 8 housing
um

01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.199 --> 01:17:56.510 align:start position:0%
um
okay

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
um I I can't phrase this as a question
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's just going to have to be a
 
01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.310 align:start position:0%
it's just going to have to be a
statement

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm uh a retired HUD employee of 29
 
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
years I'm very familiar with federally
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
funded housing including section 8.
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
um uh indeed there is very little
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
um Section 8 Project based housing uh
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
being done anymore uh
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
and uh certainly
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
um when you refer to uh something being
 
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
subsidized obviously Section 8 housing
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
is subsidized that's what section 8
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
means it's a sub it's a federal subsidy
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh and indeed there is a lot of stigma
 
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
out there about
 
01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.130 align:start position:0%
out there about
um

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
federally subsidized housing uh as to
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
whether the stigma is accurate that the
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
residents of that housing are sitting on
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
their front steps all day living on
 
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
other people's money uh that is
 
01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
um uh I would say is not accurate and I
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put that out there again
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
as someone who's very familiar with
 
01:19:08.209 --> 01:19:08.219 align:start position:0%
these issues thank you I I I would tend
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
to agree with you
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
um that seems to be what people picture
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
right when you have these kind of
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
conversations and you're trying to
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
trying to fight against that
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
that image
 
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.250 align:start position:0%
that image
um

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's Section 8 or low income
 
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit
 
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
people picture what you just stated
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
right people sitting on on the front
 
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
steps not working right and it's and
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's very instructive
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
to take uh
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
people who aren't familiar around to a
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
group of properties
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
and show them you know hey here's we'll
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
do a tour for a day we'll look at five
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
or six properties at the end you ask
 
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
them all right so which of those do you
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
think were Workforce or affordable
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
housing which were market rate
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
and we kind of do a little trick because
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
they're all Workforce and they're all
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
beautiful you know they look just like
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
market rate housing
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
um they they're well landscaped the
 
01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
facades are nice the the the cars in the
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
parking lot are what you'd expect
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
they're very
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
very normal very it meets the
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
expectation of what housing would be as
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
any kind of apartment community
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
um people's eyes are are open pretty
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
wide with that so I don't know if that's
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the committee but
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
you know sort of a awareness campaign or
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
an education campaign
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
um maybe through a Housing Commission
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
Steve suggests would be
 
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
would be valuable make it uh mandatory
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
training for Town officials I don't know
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
um we tried that though or that has been
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
tried before so okay
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
mandatory really really hurts feelings
 
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.410 align:start position:0%
mandatory really really hurts feelings
so

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:50.330 align:start position:0%
so
um representative

01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
Section 8 project in Hampton New
 
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.350 align:start position:0%
Section 8 project in Hampton New
Hampshire

01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong but I believe there is
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
no such thing as new Section 8 projects
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the entire nation that project was
 
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
done away with there is existing Section
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
8 vouchers but there are no new Section
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
8 construction projects so I agree that
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's an education project and this by
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
a commission that sold Duty uh to
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
correct some of this misinformation uh
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
but it is a Prejudice that people have
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's unfounded and can be easily
 
01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
dispelled by
 
01:21:32.699 --> 01:21:34.790 align:start position:0%
dispelled by
education

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
um again
 
01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:38.219 align:start position:0%
uh and I didn't I didn't mean to offend
 
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
anybody but if you knew the sarcastic
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
comments that have been said about me by
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
planning board members who don't know me
 
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
and don't know my background
 
01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.630 align:start position:0%
and don't know my background
um

01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
there there are some people that are on
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
boards not for the reason of doing
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
planning but for the reason of social
 
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
engineering their community and now I
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
sound like some left-wing
 
01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:09.860 align:start position:0%
trust me I grew up on a farm
 
01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.630 align:start position:0%
trust me I grew up on a farm
and

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
um my father was put out of business by
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
the people that moved into our town and
 
01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
changed how property was assessed and
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
then they couldn't understand why all
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Farms disappeared because they
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
assessed the farmers who had lots of
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
Frontage on existing streets as if they
 
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
were individual laws
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
the tax bills came in my father couldn't
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
afford to keep the farm because his tax
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill went from like two thousand dollars
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
to thirty thousand dollars and it was
 
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
all done by
 
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.890 align:start position:0%
all done by
that

01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
social engineering of changing the
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
zoning and and and so which forced my
 
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
father to sell this property to a
 
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
developer and they subdivided the farm
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
so they created the problem they were
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
and that's a true story my father's sold
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
milk to put milk company and was forced
 
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
out of business by zoning
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:14.510 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
um

01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:18.169 --> 01:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
so I I'm actually interested in the
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
communities being outed
 
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:22.970 align:start position:0%
um as far as
um

01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
like there was some talk about how
 
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
Londonderry was maybe doing some stuff
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
right but I'm also interested in
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
communities that are that are um closed
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
for business as far as housing
 
01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.050 align:start position:0%
for business as far as housing
um

01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:38.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.290 align:start position:0%
whether or not
um

01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:41.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
you feel comfortable doing that
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know in this meeting that's fine you
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
can do it in in via email or whatever as
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
far as like look uh towns that may
 
01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
um have zoning that is not uh receptive
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
to housing so and and even rules within
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
the zoning that may be onerous or
 
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.890 align:start position:0%
the zoning that may be onerous or
inappropriate

01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
um I know that I try and find those
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
things in my own local community and I
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
do as much as I can to find other
 
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.790 align:start position:0%
do as much as I can to find other
communities

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
um the information in other communities
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
but it's definitely with you know 200
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
and 40 plus communities is hard
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
um to be be up to date on all the
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
different communities so examples in of
 
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
communities would be definitely helpful
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
for me to you know be able to imp to be
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
able to pinpoint like this is an issue
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
and then see if it's in other
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
communities and especially
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
um when I'm trying to talk with other
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislators that's
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
view that local control is you know
 
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.390 align:start position:0%
view that local control is you know
Paramount

01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
Paramount
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I have to be able to have examples of
 
01:24:58.610 --> 01:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
abuses of that to be able to dispel that
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
they're just you know that no guidance
 
01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
or guard rails need to be placed in in
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
to protect the property rights of the
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
individuals so in Mr Lewis without
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
without you know naming specific towns
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
maybe give us like some rules that
 
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
you've seen that or or or ordinances
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
that may have conflicted I could I could
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
take that for a second too I believe the
 
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
the Bartlett study actually gives a bit
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
of a scorecard
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
for how restrictive or non-restrictive
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
towns are and they they actually list
 
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
out the top offenders and the top uh I
 
01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.050 align:start position:0%
out the top offenders and the top uh I
guess

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
you know helpful towns um so I think
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
that study will be very helpful from a
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
from a full perspective
 
01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure Steve or or we could share a
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
few anecdotes as well if you'd like
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
um well no he wants specifics uh I will
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
send you specifics they exist right now
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
but one of the biggest subtle ways to
 
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
prevent affordable housing because the
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
most affordable form of housing is
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
rental housing and uh I could give you a
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
list of communities that say you can't
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
build in a multi-family structure over
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
four units
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's very clear there's the the
 
01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.770 align:start position:0%
that's very clear there's the the
density

01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
density
 
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh requirements even if there is
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
multi-family zoning in a town if the
 
01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
density requirements are very
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
extreme then that requires a developer
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
to get a variance anytime you have to
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
get a variance and you'll have it by
 
01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:33.410 align:start position:0%
get a variance and you'll have it by
right

01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
There's an opportunity for the local
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
officials to knock that proposal down
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
and make it either drag out forever or
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
just have an outright no so uh
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
setbacks or another thing it's sort of
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
like the density argument if you have
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
really large setbacks you take a four
 
01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
acre lot and now you only have
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
2.8 Acres you can actually build on
 
01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.169 align:start position:0%
2.8 Acres you can actually build on
right

01:26:57.169 --> 01:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
um excess the frontage requirements yeah
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
from an environmental standpoint
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
standpoint horrible way to do your
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
zoning because then you turn over these
 
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
lots of mcmansions with three or four
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
hundred feet of Frontage that the town's
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers eventually have to get paid
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
repair but
 
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
um there are other other even more
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
Draconian things that towns have done
 
01:27:24.719 --> 01:27:26.330 align:start position:0%
Draconian things that towns have done
uh

01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
I will give you the time I mean Pembroke
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
is a really good example
 
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.129 align:start position:0%
is a really good example
um

01:27:33.129 --> 01:27:33.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
they say that they've met the
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
horrible housing quota except for when
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
you ask them show me the study they
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
don't have it
 
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
um Wyndham is a classic example uh and
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
it's interesting the wealthiest
 
01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:53.659 align:start position:0%
Community the more restrictive and less
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
willing to provide for other economic
 
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
levels of housing I doubt it will be a
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
surprise Hanover is up there with one of
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
the most restrictive zoning rules
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a that's the 10 acre
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
lot size to even build a single family
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
if I'm not wrong right it's either five
 
01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
or ten it's
 
01:28:14.699 --> 01:28:16.090 align:start position:0%
or ten it's
people

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:16.100 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
and they're and what they hide behind is
 
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
to get a master plan you
 
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
know a questionnaire that you could
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
write the question a certain way
 
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
that you'll get the response you want
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
and if they're saying we're trying to
 
01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
preserve the real character
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
grid pattern make mansions do not
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
preserve Pearl characters
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
there are much more sophisticated land
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
use Avenues
 
01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:46.820 align:start position:0%
preservable character preserved usable
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
huge pieces of land for habitat
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
certainly do you think those five to ten
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
acre Mansions are going to let you
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
cross-country ski through their backyard
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
no way but
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
I will
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
send your committee very specific
 
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.530 align:start position:0%
send your committee very specific
examples

01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
examples
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
and uh and also
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
um things that have been done that
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
appear to be meeting housing but in
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
essence I've had communities say we
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
allow multi-family zones and when you
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
overlay that zone map on a soil map
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the multi-family zones are either
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
underwater or already developed that is
 
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:32.810 align:start position:0%
underwater or already developed that is
another

01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
you know de jourive since de facto
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
I won't take up your time I'll send you
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
the examples thank you
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
um any other questions representative
 
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:46.490 align:start position:0%
um any other questions representative
Reed

01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:29:49.729 --> 01:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is going
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
to be for all the representatives of Elm
 
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.149 align:start position:0%
to be for all the representatives of Elm
Grove

01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
Grove
 
01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to say first that I
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
so appreciate all the comments that you
 
01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
all have made so far
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm so happy that obviously to the
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
extent You're Building affordable
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
housing but I think you're echoing
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
everything that we've already heard on
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
our committee which is on a bipartisan
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
basis and I I don't want to speak for
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
the whole committee but I would say
 
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
nearly unanimous opinion that these
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning is unethical and is
 
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
the the culprit for a lot of our ills
 
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
um my question and just for my
 
01:30:30.169 --> 01:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
background I grew up in Section 8
 
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
housing I my whole life I've been a
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
tenant so I uh I was offended not that
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
you were saying it but the things that
 
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
you were conveying that other people
 
01:30:43.450 --> 01:30:43.460 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
affordable housing tenants in
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
specifically section innate tenants if
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
your car isn't up to Snuff you must be a
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
bad person kind of thinking is of deeply
 
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
offensive to me and yes we can do things
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
about the town
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
um we can we can tell the town what they
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
can and cannot do and this does seem to
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
cut across regardless of party line as
 
01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
you pointed out both Hanover and Windham
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
have similar problems so it's not about
 
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's not a partisan issue my question
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
which is for all of you is the one of
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
quality and I don't mean the quality in
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
terms of what the community thinks and
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
facades and things like that I'm getting
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
to the quality for the tenants
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
themselves because I want to I want to
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
be assured that when we are helping
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
developers build what they call
 
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
Affordable housing that they are
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
actually providing good quality housing
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I mean housing quality both in terms
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
of Maintenance of the units but also
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
service to the tenants when you manage
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
your properties so for full disclosure
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
to of the committee members myself and
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo are from
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
Newmarket Elm Grove recently acquired a
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
property in New Market last year a
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
senior home center and I've been working
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
with them I've met with them I can't
 
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
even tell you how many times at least on
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
a monthly but sometimes a weekly basis
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
for the multiple issues that that
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
property has had just a few of them for
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
months and months there was a leak in a
 
01:32:12.649 --> 01:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
central hallway that we started to joke
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
was the original Wadley Falls the name
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the the place is Wadley Falls we have
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
one tenant who only has one leg who has
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
multiple accessibility issues in her
 
01:32:25.010 --> 01:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
unit as well as the property in general
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
we've had people break into and also
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
enter into tenants units without
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
permission is there is there a question
 
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
yes the question is as I've already said
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
how do we know that quality will be met
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
both in terms of service and I'm happy
 
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:43.139 align:start position:0%
to afford the emails that I've sent to
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
Elm Grove about these issues to the
 
01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
entire committee how do we know that
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
these issues will be met how do we know
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
that we will have quality what are the
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions that we can have or
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
guarantees we can have in place to make
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
sure that yes we will do everything we
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
can to help you develop affordable
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
housing but that has to be quality
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
housing that is my question it's open to
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
um on the construction side uh
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
there are numerous requirements put in
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
place by New Hampshire housing uh when
 
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
you're going through their construction
 
01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
process they have a entire uh
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
construction handbook manual on building
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
standards uh
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
Equity of amenities between units and
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's quite thorough and I will say it
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's it essentially
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
creates housing that's equivalent in my
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
view to the quality of market rate
 
01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.330 align:start position:0%
view to the quality of market rate
construction

01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:40.340 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
I wish you would argue sometimes goes
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
beyond what people do for market rate
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
construction I'll turn it over to Chris
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%

for a second Chris
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
sure I feel the need to answer directly
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
to what Miss Reed said
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know we purchased a property that
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
was 15 years old
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
15 years old and um it had been
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
professionally managed prior to us and
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
it had its fair share of problems when
 
01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:26.900 align:start position:0%
we when we when we took over management
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
a leaky pipe in a hallway which was part
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
of a heating system
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
and uh in order to repair that situation
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
we would have to replace all of the
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
heating pipes in a hallway and uh do
 
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
that of course by doing that we have to
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
shut the heat down to the end to the
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
entire property to do it it's a big
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
project and um you know you have to go
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
through you have to go through the the
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
steps to find a quality contractor to do
 
01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
it and make sure you're lining it up and
 
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's in a in a way that it'll get done
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable period of time and we
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
did that and you know I met with all of
 
01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:03.020 align:start position:0%
the residents at Wadley Falls and
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Reed was there and
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo was there and
 
01:35:07.729 --> 01:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Cahill was there
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
and the director of the local Housing
 
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
Authority was there and I stood before
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
all of the residents and answered and
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
discussed all of their questions and
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
told them what I was going to do on the
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
property and did exactly what we said we
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
not only did we did we repair the water
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
issue we've later on found that our zone
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
valve and isolation valves in every
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
single Unit were corroded and at one
 
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
point we tried to change his own valve
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
which is what gets the heat to the unit
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
we shut off the isolation valve to that
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
unit and it burst and it burst glycol
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
water from the heating system into
 
01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
somebody's apartment
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
we couldn't have that happen again and
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
so what we had to do was go in and
 
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
replace every isolation valve in 57
 
01:35:59.930 --> 01:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
apartments and every zone valve in 57
 
01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
apartments in the winter
 
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
and turn the heat off and provide space
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
heaters in order to get that project
 
01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.169 align:start position:0%
heaters in order to get that project
done

01:36:06.169 --> 01:36:06.179 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
it took two days for each building to do
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
it and it was very very challenging but
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
it got done we also promised to install
 
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
we heard from residents when we took
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
over that they would lose heat in the
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
middle of winter when the electricity
 
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
would go out because it was all it was
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
all connected to the you know the
 
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
obviously it's one heating system for
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
the whole building we went and the
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
stalled owner with without having to two
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
generators to generate to run
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
electricity for both buildings in order
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
to make sure that at the very minimum
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
the common hallways and the heating
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
system would not do not turn off we
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
spent a tremendous amount of money on
 
01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:42.179 align:start position:0%
this property we found during the
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
process that the residents were upset
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
about a lot of things when we took over
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
management things that had been you know
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
Legacy problems on the property that
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
hadn't been taken care of and we've gone
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
through and
 
01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
really addressed everything but there
 
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
are a handful of residents at this
 
01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
property particularly who who seems to
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
not want to be satisfied with anything
 
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
anything we do and we understand that
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the nature of the
 
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
business that we're in
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
um this resident with with an amp this
 
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
amputee resident
 
01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:09.229 align:start position:0%
amputee resident
um

01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
came to us asking us for a new shower to
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
be installed in her apartment what we
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
did was we offered her to move into an
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
available Ada apartment that uh that
 
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
already had that shower and she she
 
01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
didn't want that we held that unit for
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
three months trying to convince her to
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
take that unit and she didn't take that
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
unit it has since been
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
taken on as a case by Elliot Berry who
 
01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
I've been I've known for you know 10
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
years and worked well with and we've me
 
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
and him have been working on on that
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
solution he's told me not to do anything
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
in that unit until he I hear back from
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
him and I'm in regular contact with him
 
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
so I I don't feel in any way that the
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
residents at Wadley Falls are are being
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
mistreated or living in substantive
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
conditions thank you I appreciate it
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
you're not on trial so I appreciate you
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
answering the question and yeah that's
 
01:37:59.450 --> 01:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
great um are there any other questions
 
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.770 align:start position:0%
great um are there any other questions
for

01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
um Elm Grove
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
or if there's anything else you can
 
01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
contribute regarding
 
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
um regulations or anything we can do on
 
01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
the state level to alleviate I did want
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
to speak to the management side so you
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
have problem issues obviously developing
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
affordable housing with nibis and which
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
we've spoken a lot about and of course
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of zoning zoning
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
challenges and Wetland challenges and
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
fire department challenges and then you
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
have obviously construction costs
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
challenges and and all of the things
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
that this committee knows about
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
the only affordable housing programs
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
that really exists anymore are the
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit program
 
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
which is an IRS program that's that's
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
administered by Hud and by in in New
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's case New Hampshire housing
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
um you know you you you apply for and
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
receive tax credits which you which you
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
sell to an equity investor and that
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
brings Equity into the property that you
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise wouldn't have and allows you
 
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
to build a property that has rental
 
01:38:54.890 --> 01:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
rates that are based on generally 60
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
area median income but they can they can
 
01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
come averaging where you can you can
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
have set-asides for people that in the
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
20 area median income so that's somebody
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
making sixteen thousand dollars a year
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
all the way up to 80 and everything in
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
between by 10 basically
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
um it's a really interesting interesting
 
01:39:10.199 --> 01:39:11.689 align:start position:0%
um it's a really interesting interesting
program

01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
but to work with with New Hampshire
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
Housing and to and to manage a tax
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
credit property you have to have certain
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
expertise not every manager or property
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
developer would be approved to manage a
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
property like this there has to be
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
experiences certifications
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a a good deal of
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and compliance oversight
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
annual inspections you know we we have
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
our properties inspected annually by
 
01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.149 align:start position:0%
our properties inspected annually by
um

01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
HUD through react inspections file
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
reviews by New Hampshire housing if we
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
have Section 8 tenants then we have
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
section 8 voucher holder inspections
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
that are that are happening
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
um we have it and correct me if I'm
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
wrong those Section 8 voucher
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
inspections are property wide right they
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
in some cases they have to look at like
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
the stairs everywhere yeah they're going
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
to look at common areas common areas
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay they might in a property like
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
Wadley Falls where there's two buildings
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
they might just be looking at the one
 
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
building that the person but like the
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
parking lot like all that yeah the
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
stairs they're going to look for all of
 
01:40:07.610 --> 01:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
any issues with life safety okay
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
um so there there's that and then we
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
have our annual Financial audits which
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
delve also into into compliance and then
 
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
we have a requirement to do annual 100
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
unit inspections as well so there's a
 
01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
lot of people that are looking at these
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
at these units and and you know so
 
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of repairs and maintenance
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
happening all the time to to address
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
those issues but to if you
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
to build and develop and manage
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
affordable housing even on the
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
management side there's a certain amount
 
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
of expertise that's required you have to
 
01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
have hot approval you have to have New
 
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing approval you have to
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
have certifications in the management of
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credits you have
 
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
to have a an infrastructure within your
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
your company to manage that so A
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
compliance director people that
 
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
understand how to process these files
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of reporting
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
that we have to do either on a monthly
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
quarterly or annual basis so it's it's
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's worthwhile doing that's why that's
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
why we do it but not every person every
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
developer of real estate is going to be
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
wanting to develop affordable housing
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
because it's difficult it's a niche and
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
and if you get that experience and you
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
have the have those certifications and
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
you have the infrastructure built to to
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
do it then it's a lot easier but I I
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
imagine a lot of developers don't even
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
go into the go into it and in New
 
01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:28.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are only a handful of
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
experienced low-income housing tax
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
credit property management companies in
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
the first place that would provide third
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
party management I I can only think of
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
three and we're we're one of them I
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
imagine you would have to have a huge
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to manage that anyway
 
01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:44.219 align:start position:0%
it's more you know so the cost of
 
01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
managing affordable housing is higher
 
01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
than than the cost of managing market
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
rate housing okay are there other
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is how much higher
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
what what is like
 
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
um can you give me a ballpark figure of
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
like like cost per unit let's say of
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
market rate
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
um management versus cost
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
per per unit of affordable rate is it
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
like 20 more is it 50 more
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
not 50.
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take that because I think it's
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a multi-layered question
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
you've got there what what does it cost
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
it definitely costs more to staff the
 
01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
additional compliance paperwork uh
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs that are there I would
 
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:33.179 align:start position:0%
say that's in the 20 to 25 percent more
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
range however
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
the lack of competition in the
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
affordable housing management world if
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
you don't manage for yourself there's a
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
few few options out there and I think
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
that also drives up the price right not
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily the cost but the price so if
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
you're a developer who doesn't
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
do your own management
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
you may be
 
01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
forced into paying more for management
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
than you otherwise would in a more
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
competitive market
 
01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
does that make sense so in that case the
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want to necessarily go
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
into too many specifics there because
 
01:43:20.209 --> 01:43:20.219 align:start position:0%
it's it's a small world but uh it there
 
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of if you if you're a
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
developer that owns a property and you
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
don't do interim management and it's and
 
01:43:27.050 --> 01:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's affordable as a land use
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
restriction on it you don't have a lot
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
of options the cost of that compliance
 
01:43:34.129 --> 01:43:34.139 align:start position:0%
and the oversight is there if you have a
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
react inspection the HUD comes in and
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
looks at every everything they look at
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
every latch every hinge everything so
 
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
therefore there comes a laundry list of
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
of repairs to be made and then you do
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
your unit inspections and the same thing
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
happens and then Section 8 inspections
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
and the same same thing happens so you
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
know there the maintenance costs are
 
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
higher because
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
um you're you're required to respond to
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
those those inspection reports when they
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
come out can I ask specifically about I
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
know we have HUD right but we don't have
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
any control over HUD so can I ask
 
01:44:06.179 --> 01:44:07.430 align:start position:0%
any control over HUD so can I ask
specifically

01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
what on the state level
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
is a regulation or redundancy or
 
01:44:13.370 --> 01:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
something that maybe this committee can
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
look further into maybe a requirement by
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh Des or you know a code enforcement
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
requirement or or or something that you
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
know this committee can look at
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
specifically so this was something that
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
recently came to our attention
 
01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:30.169 align:start position:0%
recently came to our attention
um

01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.770 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire Housing Finance
the

01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
Section 8 Voucher Program apparently
 
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
there is a designation that the state
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
agency can get to help streamline some
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.669 align:start position:0%
of the
regulatory

01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic oversight that comes with
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
the Section 8 voucher and we're just
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
finding out about it now that they have
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
applied to have this which would help
 
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
all property owners who would accept
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
Section 8 vouchers to uh to make that an
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
easier process I wonder if there are
 
01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
other ways that the state Housing
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
Authority could
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
get a
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
delegated authority from HUD
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
to perform one inspection that meets all
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements rather than multiple
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
and have to deal with
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
two different agencies versus one
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
of the headache and pain is
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
just dealing with the online site I hate
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
to even bring it up but that's that
 
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's a it's a Vortex
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
just dealing with anything we would have
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
to do to deal with if there's some
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
technology some website that we have to
 
01:45:44.890 --> 01:45:44.900 align:start position:0%
use with HUD it was it was built in 1986
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
and it's extremely you have to get mail
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
to get the password change I mean it's
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's challenging um I know yeah no
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's challenging so this I think I
 
01:45:57.770 --> 01:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
just spoke with d poulette
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh about um I think it's called move to
 
01:46:00.239 --> 01:46:01.370 align:start position:0%
uh about um I think it's called move to
work

01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't quote me on that but it's a it's a
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's a beta test program for the Section
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
8 voucher program and there's some
 
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
really interesting things in there um
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
there are incentives for landlords to
 
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
accept Section 8 vouchers
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
um some changes to how they do
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
inspections when they do inspections so
 
01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:21.659 align:start position:0%
they for example on the light tech
 
01:46:22.729 --> 01:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
property they would only do unit
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
inspections every three years so there's
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
a bunch of kind of these changes that
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
are supposed to take some of the
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
red tape out of being involved in the
 
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
program and to make it a little little a
 
01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:36.179 align:start position:0%
better experience for landlords and you
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
can see on the New Hampshire housing
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
side they recently it's a small thing
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
but it's it's actually a big thing they
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
recently said you no longer have to send
 
01:46:45.169 --> 01:46:45.179 align:start position:0%
in quarterly Financial reports
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of little touch points
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
that we deal with with New Hampshire
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
Housing and compliance that could be uh
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
I guess polished down a little bit to
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
make it real easier the January of every
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
year is is crazy we have we have to do a
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
full on
 
01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
under the hood the financial
 
01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
um Financial audit for all of these
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
types of properties and it it takes our
 
01:47:10.609 --> 01:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
our accounting department our finance
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
department the month to so it's all that
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
they think about for an entire month and
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
at the same time we have
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
um all of these uh file review Mor's
 
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
they call them where we have to where
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing comes to the
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
property and looks through files and
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
does inspections and that sort of thing
 
01:47:27.290 --> 01:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
and those all happen around the same as
 
01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.189 align:start position:0%
and those all happen around the same as
well

01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
um so I mean there are a lot of touch
 
01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
points where they things could be
 
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
smoothed out I think I I could provide a
 
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.070 align:start position:0%
smoothed out I think I I could provide a
recommendation

01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to make any assumptions
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire housing even has to
 
01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
change the ability to change those rules
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
and I will say if if they do not have
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to change these rules we do
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I would I I would I mean our job is
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
to solicit recommendations so anything
 
01:47:54.649 --> 01:47:54.659 align:start position:0%
you have to recommend please send to the
 
01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:57.179 align:start position:0%
committee sure okay representative Gibbs
 
01:47:58.850 --> 01:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
um again this is going to basically have
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
to come out as a statement
 
01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:04.310 align:start position:0%
to come out as a statement
um

01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not arguing
 
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
um with
 
01:48:12.649 --> 01:48:12.659 align:start position:0%
everybody's understanding of the misery
 
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
of bureaucratic requirements
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
um in dealing with HUD I probably know
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
that better than anybody here
 
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.970 align:start position:0%
that better than anybody here
um

01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
there is one thing that that we all have
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind and that is that where
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
are these requirements come from and I'm
 
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
not saying that they can't be
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
streamlined because I know in a lot of
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
cases they can be and should be
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
um but where they come from is from the
 
01:48:44.450 --> 01:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
fact that what we're dealing with is the
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
expenditure of taxpayer money and when
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
we're dealing um either with direct
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
federal or state subsidies or with for
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
instance tax credit construction which
 
01:48:56.689 --> 01:48:56.699 align:start position:0%
is indeed pretty much all of the
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
low-income housing Construction in
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
recent years it is still taxpayer money
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
because we're one entity gets a tax
 
01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
credit somebody else is making up for it
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
so it's it's taxpayer money and
 
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
therefore there are requirements created
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
by Congress
 
01:49:17.639 --> 01:49:19.270 align:start position:0%
by Congress
for

01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
justifying how taxpayer money is being
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
spent and those requirements are
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
intended to make sure that it is being
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
spent properly now
 
01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.930 align:start position:0%
spent properly now
whether

01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
the reporting and so forth can be
 
01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.430 align:start position:0%
the reporting and so forth can be
streamlined

01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
streamlined
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody would argue that
 
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
that would that would be a bad thing
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's just that we have to keep in mind
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
where this comes from it comes from the
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
fact that we're talking about the
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
expenditure of taxpayer money
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
if I may respond to that and also kind
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
of draw it back up to a higher level I
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that that type of
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
oversight is warranted and and required
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
and understandable
 
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I think over time it's that creep of
 
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:08.780 align:start position:0%
every additional task
 
01:50:12.649 --> 01:50:12.659 align:start position:0%
and redundant requirement in many cases
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
that just adds to the cost at the end of
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
I think really everything about the
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
housing issue boils down to the more it
 
01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
costs to build
 
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
an apartment
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
the less Apartments will have right just
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
supply and demand so
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's no Silver Bullet in this whole
 
01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:34.820 align:start position:0%
discussion there's got to be multiple
 
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
avenues that everyone every stakeholder
 
01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
has to look at to reduce barriers
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
barriers or costs time is cost
 
01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:44.810 align:start position:0%
barriers or costs time is cost
um

01:50:44.810 --> 01:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
redundant requirements are cost and if
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
we can look at how we lower the overall
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
cost to build housing
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
the economy will take care of it we'll
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
build more because the demand's there
 
01:50:57.169 --> 01:50:57.179 align:start position:0%
the supplies the supply is not keeping
 
01:50:57.179 --> 01:50:58.370 align:start position:0%
the supplies the supply is not keeping
up

01:50:58.370 --> 01:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
and you know that economics 101 right
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
with the supply demand curve where it
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
where it meets that's the price that's
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
why I rent so high that's why single
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
family construction uh prices are so
 
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.189 align:start position:0%
family construction uh prices are so
high

01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
if I may transition a little bit to to
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
the construction costs and some ideas
 
01:51:15.239 --> 01:51:16.850 align:start position:0%
the construction costs and some ideas
there

01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:17.629 align:start position:0%
there
um

01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
construction costs a lot of it's going
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
to be outside of our control right
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh Lumber comes from Canada from other
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
parts of the country appliances come
 
01:51:30.169 --> 01:51:30.179 align:start position:0%
from overseas vinyl comes from factories
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
in Texas and it's it's it's a global
 
01:51:35.209 --> 01:51:35.219 align:start position:0%
supply chain uh it's hard to affect that
 
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
but I think what we do have the ability
 
01:51:40.129 --> 01:51:40.139 align:start position:0%
to affect a little bit more is our labor
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
um there was recently in Ohio put into
 
01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.990 align:start position:0%
um there was recently in Ohio put into
place

01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
full Reciprocity for all uh trade
 
01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:49.689 align:start position:0%
full Reciprocity for all uh trade
licensing

01:51:49.689 --> 01:51:49.699 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:51:54.649 --> 01:51:54.659 align:start position:0%
electricians Plumbing HVAC gas uh I
 
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
thought it was an incredible move for
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
that state to do because now Ohio is
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
open for business if you were a plumber
 
01:52:02.810 --> 01:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go through another
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
course another test and you want to move
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
to Ohio New Hampshire could do something
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
I think that's a pretty easy thing to do
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
well and the governor did bring that up
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
in the budget address as one of his
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
priorities and I think that's that is
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
something that bipartisan as bipartisan
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
agreement good that that would help a
 
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
lot labor costs has gone up incredibly
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
there there's there's a shortage of
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
licensed trades people I think in every
 
01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:26.030 align:start position:0%
licensed trades people I think in every
area

01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.410 align:start position:0%
area
um

01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:29.450 --> 01:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
the seeds of that were sown probably the
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
last 30 years where you know I think the
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
American kind of culture was go to
 
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
college go to Liberal Arts degree or
 
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
whatever and go that route and and the
 
01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
trades were
 
01:52:42.530 --> 01:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
you know minimized or look look down
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
upon in a lot of cases that I think the
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
pendulum swung a bit now the trade
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
schools as I understand are full they're
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
over capacity it's great it's going to
 
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
take time to rebuild that so in the in
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
the interim we need to attract
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
great qualified trades people from you
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
know outside our borders as much as we
 
01:52:58.800 --> 01:52:59.930 align:start position:0%
know outside our borders as much as we
can

01:52:59.930 --> 01:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
um maybe there's incentives I know other
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
states have offered you know relocate
 
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
and we'll help you with the down payment
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that there's a lot of
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
that was happening with the dislocation
 
01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:12.659 align:start position:0%
in covid but I I don't know all the
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
ideas I'm sure you're going to probably
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of them but bringing more
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
workers to New Hampshire
 
01:53:21.649 --> 01:53:21.659 align:start position:0%
will help us build the housing that they
 
01:53:24.010 --> 01:53:24.020 align:start position:0%
can then live in right right
 
01:53:26.209 --> 01:53:26.219 align:start position:0%
that's a big thing thank you
 
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative Conkey thank you Mr
 
01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:30.050 align:start position:0%
representative Conkey thank you Mr
chairman

01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
um briefing through some of the
 
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
information that you folks gave and see
 
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
they're you folks or someone earlier
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
talked about downsizing of units getting
 
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
costs down I see you use a term in the
 
01:53:45.649 --> 01:53:45.659 align:start position:0%
literature here of mini Flats micro
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
units so could you just tell me what
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
size that kind of square feet are you
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
looking at in those projects and and do
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
each of those units have have kitchens
 
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
or are they sharing kitchens yeah so
 
01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:05.219 align:start position:0%
one particular project we did in
 
01:54:07.129 --> 01:54:07.139 align:start position:0%
Manchester was that the flats at Hanover
 
01:54:07.139 --> 01:54:08.270 align:start position:0%
Manchester was that the flats at Hanover
common

01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
um it was previously a drug and alcohol
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
rehab facility so there were small rooms
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
in there we were able to develop the
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
concept was mini Flats um these are Stu
 
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
small studio apartments with modular
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
Furniture so a couch that turns into a
 
01:54:23.209 --> 01:54:23.219 align:start position:0%
bed a desk that turns into a bed with
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
both kitchens although cooktops and a
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
convection microwave instead of a full a
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
full oven and you know these are nicely
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
appointed granite countertops this is a
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
market rate these are market rate units
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
they're the smaller ones were are 280
 
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
um so they're they're quite small and
 
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
and you know everybody thought all the
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
Millennials are gonna you know eat this
 
01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:46.139 align:start position:0%
up but it was recent divorcees that that
 
01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:48.659 align:start position:0%
filled the building up at first
 
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
um these units though I guess the point
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
was these units we were able to build
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
for you know whatever it costs we were
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
able to rent them for at the time of the
 
01:55:01.729 --> 01:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
lease up around 950 a month for a nice
 
01:55:03.790 --> 01:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
apartment with nice amenities with a gym
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
with a cafe downstairs and an outdoor
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
area so you could get the same thing
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
that Brady Sullivan was doing in the
 
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
mills for a fraction of the cost of
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
course also a fraction of size and the
 
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
turnover there is fairly high so people
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't stay for very long they'll move
 
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
into something more like a more
 
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
reasonable size I don't believe that
 
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
that type of housing is what we would
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
develop in terms of affordable housing
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
but it is it is a valid uh there is a
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
lot of demand for spare for for studio
 
01:55:34.739 --> 01:55:36.350 align:start position:0%
lot of demand for spare for for studio
apartments

01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
um and and it's a valid way to bring
 
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
affordable housing into the community
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's a way to create some measure of
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
affordability within market rate now I
 
01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:47.270 align:start position:0%
affordability within market rate now I
think

01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:55:49.729 --> 01:55:49.739 align:start position:0%
that goes into the to the density in
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester they were supportive of doing
 
01:55:54.649 --> 01:55:54.659 align:start position:0%
a really dense uh Redevelopment of
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
existing property
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
it was a huge success there there was no
 
01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
parking actually at the building that we
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
were scared about that initially and uh
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
what we found
 
01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:08.219 align:start position:0%
over and over again in Manchester and in
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
Concord is that
 
01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
especially for kind of urban infill
 
01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment of existing properties
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
that might be partially vacant or
 
01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
decrepit is that that model can work
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
really well and it does provide
 
01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
residence and option uh different than
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
the two thousand dollar 2200 a month two
 
01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
bedroom apartment for the outskirts of
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
town it's not under the tax credit
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
program but it
 
01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
does cost a lot less per month I think
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's a really cool concept almost like
 
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:37.609 align:start position:0%
it's a really cool concept almost like
like

01:56:37.609 --> 01:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
just an upgrade from like college dorm
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
you know like right right when you're
 
01:56:43.370 --> 01:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
like leaving you have your own bedroom
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
but maybe shared spaces in some ways
 
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
some way one of our employees graduated
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
from college came to work for us lived
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
there for a year and a half then as his
 
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
income went up you know I got promoted
 
01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:55.139 align:start position:0%
he went to a bigger place it's great
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's a great place for people who are in
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
a transitional period or an upwardly
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
mobile period in there you know perfect
 
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey all set yeah
 
01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:06.050 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey all set yeah
okay

01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
um representative Delorenzo I I like
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
that concept of the mini sweeps or mini
 
01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
units um is there any like common area
 
01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
where a person who lived in one of those
 
01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
many units could
 
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
say that they work from home Associated
 
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
office space for folks as an option in
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
in that particular case there's a
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
there's a cafe the restoration Cafe
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
um in Manchester uh when when they close
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
up at night they they pull the garage
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
door down over there over their counter
 
01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
and leave all of their dining area uh
 
01:57:42.530 --> 01:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
open to and outdoor area open to the
 
01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
residence so they residents then can
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
come in and have an event or or you're
 
01:57:48.649 --> 01:57:48.659 align:start position:0%
right work down there and be around
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
other people
 
01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
um I feel that that concept regardless
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
of what we did at that property is one
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
that you would you would always want to
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
try to do because
 
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
it does provide that value of space some
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
Elbow Room if you were to just stack a
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
lot of 280 square foot apartments with
 
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
no common space they would not rent very
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
well I don't think right they wouldn't
 
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
hold up well yeah over time it would
 
01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
turn into a
 
01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know what you might typically think
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
of as a rooming house and
 
01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
a trouble that might come with that
 
01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
for five years this property has has
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
maintained itself as a is it attractive
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
nice apartment complex with um you know
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
upwardly mobile people moving in and out
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and it it works I
 
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
don't know that it works in every
 
01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
Community right or how many of them
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
um and I I suppose the to take after my
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
seat mate this might be a little bit
 
01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
more of a statement but I I do commend
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
the idea of smaller you know doing
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
whatever kind of like what the previous
 
01:58:59.689 --> 01:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
people said
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
um you know everything
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of having smaller units
 
01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
but I want us to hold in our minds but
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
also one of the reasons I put into my
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
Adu Bill to increase the size of adus is
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
because 750 square feet just really
 
01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
isn't long-term sustainable for most
 
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
people to live in so if we're looking
 
01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
for sustainable housing in terms of
 
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
keeping people in communities long term
 
01:59:24.169 --> 01:59:24.179 align:start position:0%
we need to have
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
um more reasonable I think was how Chris
 
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
said it more reasonably sized uh places
 
01:59:31.490 --> 01:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
as well as the smaller and I have a
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
convection uh microwave oven that I I
 
01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
and I don't use my regular oven so I
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
holy wholeheartedly support the idea of
 
01:59:39.649 --> 01:59:39.659 align:start position:0%
smaller stuff but I want us to keep in
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
mind that we also have to do things that
 
01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
are going to be sustainable long term I
 
01:59:45.129 --> 01:59:45.139 align:start position:0%
think that's the key though right
 
01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
everything yeah every ad user are you're
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
not going to solve the housing crisis
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
with adus but not that it is low but
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's a there
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
if I own a home where I can have an Adu
 
02:00:01.609 --> 02:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
it's there's a lot my mother my mother's
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
aging there's there's an opportunity to
 
02:00:05.209 --> 02:00:05.219 align:start position:0%
bring her in there or or eventually use
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
it as a way to augment my um my mortgage
 
02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
adus are great and they should be
 
02:00:14.089 --> 02:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
um micro units you know of course you're
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
gonna have communities that say no your
 
02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
unit can't be bigger than or smaller
 
02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:18.410 align:start position:0%
unit can't be bigger than or smaller
than

02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
700 square feet but then that takes out
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
all the 500 and 280 square foot homes
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
that will will help people if you look
 
02:00:28.129 --> 02:00:28.139 align:start position:0%
over in you know Japan where the people
 
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
are living in pods that's an air I'm not
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
saying we need to do that here but you
 
02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
know everything is should be on the
 
02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:35.689 align:start position:0%
know everything is should be on the
table

02:00:35.689 --> 02:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
table
 
02:00:37.850 --> 02:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
there's a concept like you have a
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
stronger Community within your town but
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
also within the building when you have
 
02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
like the smaller units and let people
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
decide where they right where and how
 
02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
they want to to live yeah I'm sure the
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
person that moves into the flats at 280
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
square feet this isn't the ice some
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
people think it's the greatest thing
 
02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
yeah but at some point they it's it's
 
02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
right for them at some point it's not
 
02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:03.179 align:start position:0%
right for them there's always somebody
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
else that it's right for and yeah and it
 
02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
allowed us to put double the units into
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
a building that we otherwise would
 
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
normally traditionally done as soon as
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
you restrict to minimums or maximums
 
02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:17.179 align:start position:0%
you're you're lowering the overall
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
potential pool of Housing Development
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
right the market will respond to demand
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
so if somebody wants to move from the
 
02:01:28.129 --> 02:01:28.139 align:start position:0%
750 to 1200 and then to a single family
 
02:01:28.139 --> 02:01:29.089 align:start position:0%
750 to 1200 and then to a single family
home

02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
the market will see that they'll see the
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
demand and it will try to develop
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
housing it's when you restrict you say
 
02:01:35.689 --> 02:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
no you can't build these
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
the market can't react it can't respond
 
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
it can't build that housing and the risk
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
all falls on you know someday micro
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
units won't be popular anymore and we'll
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
have an empty building and we're going
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
to have to redevelop our building and
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
put in half the number of units and or
 
02:01:50.689 --> 02:01:50.699 align:start position:0%
when it was built it was four or five
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
units this this property was originally
 
02:01:54.109 --> 02:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
a private complex with five units I
 
02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
lived in Japan three years so I was glad
 
02:01:58.490 --> 02:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
you brought that up but it's it's uh it
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think it'll ever not be a good
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
thing but yeah just wanting to Encompass
 
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
everyone's needs and people's needs are
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
different all right well in in the
 
02:02:07.729 --> 02:02:07.739 align:start position:0%
effort to close this up I'm gonna let
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey go represent
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
yokella let you guys close out and then
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to break for lunch
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen the Manchester unit
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
that you spoke about is not shown could
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
you just tell me that property name
 
02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
again oh that's called the flats at
 
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
Hanover common the flats nh.com
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
um what you're looking at is the uh the
 
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
Star Building and the kirsage which is
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
over by um what was White Mountain
 
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
Coffee that's right the curious so I
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
just want to bring up the point the
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
community or to the committee that the
 
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
mix is really important to talk about
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
subdivisions is not totally the answer I
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
brought up in earlier conversations
 
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
there's retailers that they're what
 
02:02:50.450 --> 02:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
they're paying for rent isn't or what
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
they're paying for wages isn't
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
tremendous and having the ability to
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
House people in your building
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think his Merit so I think I think
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
it's a mix of everything thank you Joan
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the course
 
02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:05.109 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the course
representative

02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
I just felt the need to disagree with my
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
my seat mate over here because
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
um I my house is it's not even an
 
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
apartment and it's less than 700 square
 
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
feet and I've lived in it for seven
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
years and I'm not planning on leaving
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
anytime soon and so I think that it's
 
02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:30.179 align:start position:0%
um allowing opportunities for for
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
someone like me that doesn't
 
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
understands that property that if I got
 
02:03:37.850 --> 02:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
a bigger house I would have to pay more
 
02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:39.050 align:start position:0%
a bigger house I would have to pay more
taxes

02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
that and and am able to live in a
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
smaller area that that those needs are
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
being able to be met by being allowed to
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
be built and not having a minimum
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
um and so I do I do think
 
02:03:56.330 --> 02:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we might
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
consider is is not is in the Adu
 
02:04:00.239 --> 02:04:01.970 align:start position:0%
consider is is not is in the Adu
legislation

02:04:01.970 --> 02:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
um saying that they're you know you
 
02:04:05.450 --> 02:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
can't have a minimum like you can say
 
02:04:08.689 --> 02:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
maybe set a maximum as far as of as that
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
but maybe removing the minimum
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
requirement might be some or uh the
 
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
option for a minimum requirement
 
02:04:17.209 --> 02:04:17.219 align:start position:0%
um might be something that the committee
 
02:04:19.129 --> 02:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
might be open to or just in general
 
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
talking about the Adu issues and and
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
um allowing developers
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
um to be able to
 
02:04:30.169 --> 02:04:30.179 align:start position:0%
have those different types of units like
 
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
maybe a 200 square foot unit and a
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
thousand square foot unit it's going to
 
02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
be you know I'm not going to be having
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
four kids in my house but
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah so I just wanted to say that
 
02:04:47.209 --> 02:04:47.219 align:start position:0%
as we don't just well I mean she said
 
02:04:49.970 --> 02:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
that some people under use we were
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
saying something about people under 700
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
square feet might might not want to live
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
in it for more than a year and that's
 
02:04:59.089 --> 02:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
what I was I was saying opposing
 
02:04:59.099 --> 02:05:00.890 align:start position:0%
what I was I was saying opposing
well

02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:05:04.729 --> 02:05:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.129 --> 02:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
you might be surprised to know that I
 
02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
lived in a 24 by 24 so 600 square foot
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
home for 11 years by by an experience in
 
02:05:13.679 --> 02:05:16.750 align:start position:0%
home for 11 years by by an experience in
Japan

02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
well and I I want to thank you gentlemen
 
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
for presenting to us
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I do want any feedback you can at all
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
that we can do on the state level with
 
02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:27.770 align:start position:0%
that we can do on the state level with
agencies

02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
um any roadblocks you're looking at we
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
understand there's a local control issue
 
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
we get it
 
02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I guess but that's not something we
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
really necessarily want to touch here we
 
02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
want to see what we can do on the state
 
02:05:37.139 --> 02:05:38.450 align:start position:0%
want to see what we can do on the state
level

02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
um you've given us some good ideas but
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
anything else you think of please please
 
02:05:44.209 --> 02:05:44.219 align:start position:0%
please amola committee
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll absolutely follow up with a
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
few of those studies that we mentioned
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
to put a bit of a challenge out there I
 
02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
would say
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
bold and I think needed for
 
02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
the state legislature to take on a
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of that local control without
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
stripping it away completely right
 
02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's what makes New Hampshire special
 
02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:10.010 align:start position:0%
that's what makes New Hampshire special
but

02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh holding local municipalities
 
02:06:15.410 --> 02:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
accountable to as Steve was saying the
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution right uh when it goes
 
02:06:18.239 --> 02:06:20.930 align:start position:0%
Constitution right uh when it goes
beyond

02:06:20.930 --> 02:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
Beyond The Pale uh that's where I think
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
the state does have a goal so okay A
 
02:06:27.050 --> 02:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
little bit of a challenge we need the
 
02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:27.970 align:start position:0%
little bit of a challenge we need the
help

02:06:27.970 --> 02:06:27.980 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Bill so it's out there yeah
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
yes and I think the uh the state has
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
done a good job of having all of our
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
state agencies be a little bit more
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
customer friendly and provide a little
 
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
bit better level of customer service
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to do the same thing
 
02:06:45.709 --> 02:06:45.719 align:start position:0%
to get the municipalities to be on board
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
with that as well
 
02:06:49.609 --> 02:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of it comes from their
 
02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
ignorance of uh the zoning regulations
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
and the application thereof and uh yeah
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
I think this is the opportunity for us
 
02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
to come up with a multi-faceted approach
 
02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
regulation Improvement zoning
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement uh compliance with the
 
02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
federal uh with our federal overlords as
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
far as the money goes all of these
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
things I think will make a big
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
difference and let us all get back to
 
02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
doing what we do providing housing for
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
people here in New Hampshire
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you and with that we're on
 
02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
the committee is going to break until
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
promptly at one o'clock in presentation
 
02:07:23.149 --> 02:07:23.159 align:start position:0%

good afternoon
 
03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:27.240 align:start position:0%

03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just getting old enough that I um

I can't I can't see you without my
 
03:04:34.130 --> 03:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
glasses and I can't see my paper with
 
03:04:35.450 --> 03:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
sunglasses so this is going to be
 
03:04:38.269 --> 03:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
interesting welcome to the club
 
03:04:40.309 --> 03:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
yeah it is a little dangerous in the
 
03:04:41.929 --> 03:04:41.939 align:start position:0%
stairs actually
 
03:04:43.730 --> 03:04:43.740 align:start position:0%

03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
I um spoiler alert we do not build
 
03:04:53.399 --> 03:04:54.830 align:start position:0%
I um spoiler alert we do not build
housing

03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:04:58.610 --> 03:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
we do not address Supply and that is the
 
03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
the kind of um
 
03:05:03.469 --> 03:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
the direction I've received from the
 
03:05:04.849 --> 03:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
members of the committee is to focus
 
03:05:08.389 --> 03:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
really more on that so I'm gonna come at
 
03:05:10.849 --> 03:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
it from a slightly I'm going to try to
 
03:05:12.410 --> 03:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
just tell you a little bit about what we
 
03:05:16.250 --> 03:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
do and I'm going to tell you like one or
 
03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
two maybe things that you might be able
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
to to do but mainly I'm gonna yield my
 
03:05:25.250 --> 03:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
time to my colleagues in the back who
 
03:05:26.990 --> 03:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot more data and information
 
03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:28.910 align:start position:0%
have a lot more data and information
about

03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:05:30.650 --> 03:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Housing and housing
 
03:05:33.530 --> 03:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
action New Hampshire so
 
03:05:34.849 --> 03:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire legal assistance is a
 
03:05:36.769 --> 03:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
non-profit Law Firm we provide free
 
03:05:39.230 --> 03:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
legal help to low-income Granite Staters
 
03:05:41.290 --> 03:05:41.300 align:start position:0%
we have five offices across the state
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
Berlin Claremont Portsmouth Manchester
 
03:05:47.450 --> 03:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
and Concord and we provide legal
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
assistance in lots of different areas of
 
03:05:51.530 --> 03:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
the law and not not just housing but
 
03:05:54.050 --> 03:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
housing is our largest area practice
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
area so
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
um and that work really focuses on
 
03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
preserving housing and preventing
 
03:06:00.359 --> 03:06:01.790 align:start position:0%
preserving housing and preventing
homelessness

03:06:01.790 --> 03:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
so one of our top priorities which we
 
03:06:05.630 --> 03:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit about earlier is
 
03:06:07.510 --> 03:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
preserving vouchers
 
03:06:10.670 --> 03:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
vouchers take many years for folks to
 
03:06:12.410 --> 03:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
get like I think five to seven years is
 
03:06:12.420 --> 03:06:13.969 align:start position:0%
get like I think five to seven years is
roughly

03:06:13.969 --> 03:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
um typical
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
and those vouchers pay allow a tenant to
 
03:06:22.210 --> 03:06:22.220 align:start position:0%
pay about 30 percent of their income
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
towards rent uh I'm kind of simplifying
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
things a little bit otherwise we get
 
03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
really in the weeds really quickly but
 
03:06:32.929 --> 03:06:32.939 align:start position:0%
um so if they lose that it's huge it's a
 
03:06:37.490 --> 03:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
huge loss to them and to their entire
 
03:06:40.330 --> 03:06:40.340 align:start position:0%
life I guess I would say in terms of
 
03:06:42.170 --> 03:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
destabilizing a lot of different things
 
03:06:42.180 --> 03:06:43.969 align:start position:0%
destabilizing a lot of different things
so

03:06:43.969 --> 03:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
um it's also really hard to find an
 
03:06:48.110 --> 03:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
apartment that will accept a voucher or
 
03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
that you know is a suitable for a
 
03:06:50.760 --> 03:06:52.130 align:start position:0%
that you know is a suitable for a
voucher

03:06:52.130 --> 03:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
voucher
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
um so we actually have a situation where
 
03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
people wait years and years to get a
 
03:06:57.650 --> 03:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
voucher right now and then eight about
 
03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
18 each year lose those vouchers because
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
they can't find somewhere to use it so
 
03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of so when someone comes
 
03:07:08.809 --> 03:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
to us with a I'm going to lose my
 
03:07:10.730 --> 03:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
voucher it's a really high priority for
 
03:07:13.610 --> 03:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
us because it's it's a Lifeline for them
 
03:07:17.210 --> 03:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
um generally we're talking about oh I
 
03:07:18.610 --> 03:07:18.620 align:start position:0%
think about
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
60 or maybe a little higher
 
03:07:24.170 --> 03:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
um of voucher holders also have
 
03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
disabilities so it's a um like I said
 
03:07:30.290 --> 03:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
it's it really does kind of have a
 
03:07:31.610 --> 03:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
ripple effect in their lives if they
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
lose that and so and it also has a lot
 
03:07:36.769 --> 03:07:36.779 align:start position:0%
of value you know to the in terms of
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh stabilizing someone's housing and
 
03:07:42.170 --> 03:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
it's over a long term versus like you
 
03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
know one month's rent or something like
 
03:07:46.490 --> 03:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
that so that's why we we've prioritized
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
that we also do work to prevent
 
03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:49.670 align:start position:0%
that we also do work to prevent
evictions

03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
evictions
 
03:07:52.969 --> 03:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
um we all know I think just it pretty
 
03:07:54.650 --> 03:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
common sense I think that once someone
 
03:07:56.750 --> 03:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
is homeless it's incredibly difficult to
 
03:07:58.849 --> 03:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
get them rehoused it's also very
 
03:07:58.859 --> 03:08:00.710 align:start position:0%
get them rehoused it's also very
expensive

03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
03:08:03.889 --> 03:08:03.899 align:start position:0%
um to get them rehoused and
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so if we can avoid evictions that's
 
03:08:10.130 --> 03:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
something we try to do we
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
we are seeing a lot of
 
03:08:13.200 --> 03:08:13.849 align:start position:0%
we are seeing a lot of
um

03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:16.010 --> 03:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
the trends lately in terms of those
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
cases are related to rent increases and
 
03:08:18.960 --> 03:08:21.050 align:start position:0%
cases are related to rent increases and
renovations

03:08:21.050 --> 03:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
03:08:23.150 --> 03:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and it's just really hard in this
 
03:08:26.269 --> 03:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
market to find an alternative place to
 
03:08:28.190 --> 03:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
live so
 
03:08:29.929 --> 03:08:29.939 align:start position:0%
um as I'm sure others have already
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
talked about and we'll talk about we
 
03:08:34.070 --> 03:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
have less than a we have I think it's
 
03:08:35.929 --> 03:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
point three percent vacancy rate at this
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
point somewhere between 0.3 and 0.5 at
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
any time
 
03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
um so it is
 
03:08:43.730 --> 03:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
just a really tough environment for
 
03:08:46.969 --> 03:08:46.979 align:start position:0%
someone to find alternative housing
 
03:08:49.010 --> 03:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh on short order especially and with
 
03:08:51.769 --> 03:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
limited income so the ways that we do
 
03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
this work we do have eviction clinics
 
03:08:56.870 --> 03:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
where we particularly in Manchester and
 
03:08:59.809 --> 03:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
Nashua where they have kind of eviction
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
cases all scheduled on the same day
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
um it was obviously a lot easier to do
 
03:09:06.889 --> 03:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
that work or make an impact and avoid
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
prevent evictions when we had the
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
emergency rental assistance money to for
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
folks to be able to make their landlords
 
03:09:14.880 --> 03:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
folks to be able to make their landlords
whole

03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:09:16.080 --> 03:09:16.910 align:start position:0%
whole
um

03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
we also work on the homeowners
 
03:09:23.650 --> 03:09:23.660 align:start position:0%
assistance fund which helps to prevent
 
03:09:25.990 --> 03:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
foreclosures we help people access
 
03:09:30.050 --> 03:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
property tax exemptions or and things
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
like that that might that they're
 
03:09:33.170 --> 03:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
03:09:37.010 --> 03:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
um so that's kind of in a nutshell uh
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
where you know kind of what we do
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
related to housing and
 
03:09:45.110 --> 03:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I think the biggest thing that this
 
03:09:48.530 --> 03:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
this body or this specific committee but
 
03:09:50.929 --> 03:09:50.939 align:start position:0%
also just the body in general can do is
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
to really think hard about legislation
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
that comes before you in terms of what
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
its impact might be on the housing
 
03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
um environment that we're currently in
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so for example trying not to further
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
destabilizing destabilize housing
 
03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:08.809 align:start position:0%
destabilizing destabilize housing
um

03:10:08.809 --> 03:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
for example I know that this group isn't
 
03:10:13.370 --> 03:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily interested in in additional
 
03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
landlord-tenant restrictions
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so or regulation but
 
03:10:22.250 --> 03:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
um we we would argue that you know there
 
03:10:24.290 --> 03:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
are lots of ways to evict someone we
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
have a very rob you know a very robust
 
03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:28.370 align:start position:0%
have a very rob you know a very robust
um

03:10:28.370 --> 03:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
set of options for folks to to evict
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
someone if someone is a problem
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously if someone's not paying
 
03:10:35.929 --> 03:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
their rent if someone is destructive all
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
the all these different ways to evict
 
03:10:37.439 --> 03:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
the all these different ways to evict
someone

03:10:38.630 --> 03:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
someone
 
03:10:40.849 --> 03:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
um so anything we don't necessarily need
 
03:10:42.469 --> 03:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
more ways to make it easier to evict
 
03:10:44.870 --> 03:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
anyone that's one thing we would say
 
03:10:46.490 --> 03:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:10:46.500 --> 03:10:48.530 align:start position:0%
and then
um

03:10:48.530 --> 03:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:51.230 --> 03:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
the another area I guess where we would
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
be happy to work with folks on is is one
 
03:10:55.730 --> 03:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
of the conversations that came up before
 
03:10:57.950 --> 03:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
the break was about
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
um you know ways to incentivize
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
landlords to participate in
 
03:11:05.570 --> 03:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
the HUD programs and streamlining those
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
processes as much as possible
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I would all that also goes to another
 
03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:13.190 align:start position:0%
um I would all that also goes to another
legislative

03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
option I guess or that one of the things
 
03:11:18.410 --> 03:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
that was discussed earlier was also
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
um the stigma
 
03:11:24.110 --> 03:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
um around different uh vouchers in the
 
03:11:27.650 --> 03:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
or or different people essentially
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
um that require housing in our state
 
03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:31.849 align:start position:0%
um that require housing in our state
um

03:11:31.849 --> 03:11:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe one way to address that would
 
03:11:35.520 --> 03:11:36.590 align:start position:0%
and maybe one way to address that would
be

03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:11:38.210 --> 03:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
um and this is there's a bill currently
 
03:11:40.010 --> 03:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
being considered around housing about
 
03:11:42.410 --> 03:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
your discrimination
 
03:11:44.929 --> 03:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
um if you let someone in the door right
 
03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
and you get to know the person as an
 
03:11:46.319 --> 03:11:48.050 align:start position:0%
and you get to know the person as an
individual

03:11:48.050 --> 03:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:11:50.269 --> 03:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
um you might find that that on a
 
03:11:52.370 --> 03:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
one-on-one basis is really goes a long
 
03:11:54.050 --> 03:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
way in terms of destigmatizing or
 
03:11:55.969 --> 03:11:55.979 align:start position:0%
dispelling kind of the myths that exists
 
03:11:58.250 --> 03:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
about folks that
 
03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
um might have a housing voucher for
 
03:12:02.030 --> 03:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
example so
 
03:12:05.330 --> 03:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
that is I said I'd be quick I tried to
 
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
stay to the
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
areas of Interest
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
so I try to follow directions well I I
 
03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it a lot thank you for
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
obliging us
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
um uh representative McConkey
 
03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Dawn educate me
 
03:12:24.349 --> 03:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
a little please
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
um vouchers when you say vouchers and
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
those being distributed through your
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
department or is that we do not
 
03:12:32.809 --> 03:12:32.819 align:start position:0%
distribute the vouchers at all no
 
03:12:36.590 --> 03:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
so and the 30 if someone gets through
 
03:12:39.230 --> 03:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
the system or is in line long enough and
 
03:12:43.370 --> 03:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
they get this 30 percent is is is there
 
03:12:46.370 --> 03:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
a cap on what the 70 percent on top of
 
03:12:49.450 --> 03:12:49.460 align:start position:0%
that that total rent can accumulate
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
yes well just to clarifying twelve
 
03:12:54.050 --> 03:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month yes there are
 
03:12:56.570 --> 03:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
all kinds of regulations around what the
 
03:12:57.889 --> 03:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
rent can be and that's one of the other
 
03:13:00.290 --> 03:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
challenges to finding a suitable when I
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned is finding a suitable
 
03:13:04.010 --> 03:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
apartment to use the voucher it's not
 
03:13:06.410 --> 03:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
just about landlords willingness to
 
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
participate in the program it's also
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
about like the market rate of the rent
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
and all of those things and if you don't
 
03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:12.469 align:start position:0%
and all of those things and if you don't
mind

03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:13:14.450 --> 03:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
um it's and basically it's about 30
 
03:13:18.170 --> 03:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
percent of the tenants income goes
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
towards rent and then the difference
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay is paid for by the voucher but I'm
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
gonna defer any more kind of granular
 
03:13:25.870 --> 03:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
questions about that
 
03:13:29.389 --> 03:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman is is are we talking Section
 
03:13:31.309 --> 03:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
8 what's what's the term for what I'm
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
looking at yes section eight we actually
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's called housing Choice vouchers now
 
03:13:39.290 --> 03:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative Gibbs
 
03:13:41.389 --> 03:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you um just in terms of the
 
03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
distribution of vouchers um I can help a
 
03:13:45.230 --> 03:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
little bit there
 
03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
um uh housing vouchers are normally
 
03:13:50.330 --> 03:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
distributed uh by local housing
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
authorities and some are also
 
03:13:54.110 --> 03:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
distributed by state housing authorities
 
03:13:57.230 --> 03:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
the funding comes from HUD to the state
 
03:13:59.210 --> 03:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
housing authorities and to the local
 
03:14:00.889 --> 03:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
housing authorities which then
 
03:14:04.070 --> 03:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
distribute the vouchers and there are
 
03:14:06.230 --> 03:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
HUD regulations
 
03:14:11.809 --> 03:14:11.819 align:start position:0%
um uh in regard to uh rent which vary by
 
03:14:15.230 --> 03:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
location in terms of the um uh housing
 
03:14:17.929 --> 03:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
market in the location and there are
 
03:14:20.450 --> 03:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
also other requirements
 
03:14:23.090 --> 03:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of the housing itself right
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Broody okay thank
 
03:14:30.889 --> 03:14:30.899 align:start position:0%

03:14:34.010 --> 03:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
help uh stop foreclosures how do you do
 
03:14:36.650 --> 03:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
that well I don't personally do it we
 
03:14:39.650 --> 03:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
have a couple of uh attorneys who work
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
on that project
 
03:14:43.610 --> 03:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and it's really I you generally and
 
03:14:45.230 --> 03:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to have provide more
 
03:14:46.910 --> 03:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
information or have them come and speak
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
to you about it it it's generally folks
 
03:14:50.929 --> 03:14:50.939 align:start position:0%
that have
 
03:14:53.870 --> 03:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
um there's some sort of well it's a
 
03:14:56.090 --> 03:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
similar program the the homeowners
 
03:14:58.849 --> 03:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
assistance fund was set up um during
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
kova to help homeowners who've gotten
 
03:15:03.650 --> 03:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
behind in their mortgages so that's
 
03:15:06.050 --> 03:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
that's a temporary kind of funding
 
03:15:07.250 --> 03:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
source that's available right now to
 
03:15:08.450 --> 03:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
help people with their mortgages and
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes and utilities
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
um related to their home ownership and
 
03:15:14.690 --> 03:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
then in terms of
 
03:15:14.700 --> 03:15:15.530 align:start position:0%
then in terms of
um

03:15:15.530 --> 03:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
previous prior to covid
 
03:15:21.650 --> 03:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
um we've we've always had a I would say
 
03:15:23.690 --> 03:15:23.700 align:start position:0%
like a foreclosure it's called our
 
03:15:25.490 --> 03:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
foreclosure relief project and it has to
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
do with folks that have
 
03:15:31.370 --> 03:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh we're not providing funding so it's
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
really just about
 
03:15:35.450 --> 03:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
how to
 
03:15:37.849 --> 03:15:37.859 align:start position:0%
um remedy a situation that's developed
 
03:15:41.450 --> 03:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
between the actual mortgage company and
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
the individual and order to preserve
 
03:15:45.950 --> 03:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
their housing sometimes it's about like
 
03:15:49.309 --> 03:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
things like you know the statements the
 
03:15:51.050 --> 03:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
mortgage mortgage got sold to some
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
another company and the person didn't
 
03:15:55.730 --> 03:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
get the right information and the
 
03:15:57.410 --> 03:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
payments weren't making it to the right
 
03:15:59.450 --> 03:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
place like those kinds of things where
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to work with the mortgage
 
03:16:02.990 --> 03:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
between the
 
03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:03.769 align:start position:0%
between the
um

03:16:03.769 --> 03:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:06.110 --> 03:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
the homeowner and the mortgage
 
03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
lender to address those kind of issues
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
so that they don't lose their home back
 
03:16:14.450 --> 03:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
around 2007 and 2008 that was a big part
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
of my business helping people uh stay
 
03:16:19.490 --> 03:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
out of foreclosures and they'd wind up
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
in shot sales maybe but at least it'd
 
03:16:23.150 --> 03:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
keep them in your house for another six
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
months or a year or whatever but I I was
 
03:16:27.530 --> 03:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
always thinking of
 
03:16:29.870 --> 03:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
maybe in a banking commission or didn't
 
03:16:31.309 --> 03:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
want to play ball with me at the time
 
03:16:33.950 --> 03:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
where some of these people have
 
03:16:36.530 --> 03:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
50 or 60 percent equity in their home
 
03:16:39.469 --> 03:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
and they can't meet their payments
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
and the banks would foreclose and they
 
03:16:42.650 --> 03:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
didn't care what they got for it because
 
03:16:45.530 --> 03:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
it wasn't their money anyway just get it
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
off their books and I that was always a
 
03:16:52.490 --> 03:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
sore in my side that people would lose a
 
03:16:54.650 --> 03:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
lifetime of equity
 
03:16:58.610 --> 03:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
in a bank that doesn't have a high so I
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
thought you might have we've definitely
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
that would that would be a way to keep
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
people from being homeless too and uh
 
03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
yep absolutely that's one another way to
 
03:17:09.590 --> 03:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
avoid homelessness for sure
 
03:17:11.929 --> 03:17:11.939 align:start position:0%

03:17:54.710 --> 03:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:17:56.809 --> 03:17:56.819 align:start position:0%
it was obviously much easier to you know
 
03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
you could the the Caps were are also
 
03:18:02.929 --> 03:18:02.939 align:start position:0%
often on site
 
03:18:05.330 --> 03:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
um they were previously they're I think
 
03:18:07.250 --> 03:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
for the most part they're no longer on
 
03:18:07.260 --> 03:18:08.450 align:start position:0%
for the most part they're no longer on
site

03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
site
 
03:18:09.769 --> 03:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
um because the the funding is not
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
available we're still doing the eviction
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
clinics but it makes just coming to an
 
03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
agreement a little harder but yes
 
03:18:16.849 --> 03:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
they're referring we were referring
 
03:18:19.010 --> 03:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
folks right over to the Caps to if they
 
03:18:20.210 --> 03:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
hadn't already applied or if they had
 
03:18:21.710 --> 03:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
applied they just needed to sort out the
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
status of their application Etc they
 
03:18:25.610 --> 03:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
could do that right on site and we could
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the landlords to try to
 
03:18:29.210 --> 03:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
work out like whether it was like
 
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
extending their move out time so that
 
03:18:34.250 --> 03:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
they could find another place to live or
 
03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
03:18:38.809 --> 03:18:38.819 align:start position:0%
may I follow up of course so um I'm
 
03:18:41.389 --> 03:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
aware that Rockingham County does have
 
03:18:44.510 --> 03:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
um yes money you're right rent do you
 
03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
know of any of the other Counties have
 
03:18:48.769 --> 03:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
some um Rockingham County is the only
 
03:18:51.769 --> 03:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
one that has an application open at this
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
point I believe
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
um although maybe Ben might have more
 
03:18:57.410 --> 03:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
information about that than I do as well
 
03:18:57.420 --> 03:18:58.429 align:start position:0%
information about that than I do as well
but

03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:18:58.439 --> 03:18:59.330 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:18:59.330 --> 03:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:01.250 --> 03:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
I believe there and there's some state
 
03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
level money that's that's really being
 
03:19:04.500 --> 03:19:05.330 align:start position:0%
level money that's that's really being
um

03:19:05.330 --> 03:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
targeted to folks that are already
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
currently getting assistance through
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
that program
 
03:19:12.349 --> 03:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
um but that and that is finite and will
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
end for different households in the
 
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
upcoming months thank you
 
03:19:22.010 --> 03:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking specifically at
 
03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
um something I heard from Elm Grove that
 
03:19:25.250 --> 03:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
was a
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
sort of a roadblock was the amount of
 
03:19:30.530 --> 03:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
inspections that happen right and that
 
03:19:32.929 --> 03:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
comes through you know whatever sort of
 
03:19:35.570 --> 03:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
vouchers they get or you know um low
 
03:19:37.070 --> 03:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
income housing tax tax credits things
 
03:19:38.990 --> 03:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
like that they're subject to a a ton of
 
03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:40.190 align:start position:0%
like that they're subject to a a ton of
inspections

03:19:40.190 --> 03:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:41.570 align:start position:0%
inspections
um

03:19:41.570 --> 03:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:43.849 --> 03:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
would there be a solution to maybe
 
03:19:46.250 --> 03:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
streamline the inspection process so
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
that maybe they're only getting
 
03:19:47.760 --> 03:19:48.889 align:start position:0%
that maybe they're only getting
inspected

03:19:48.889 --> 03:19:48.899 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
once a year by person that's certified
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
to inspect for everything or like do you
 
03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
have any feedback on that like something
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
03:19:57.650 --> 03:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a great question and I
 
03:19:59.330 --> 03:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
did hear him raise that issue before the
 
03:19:59.340 --> 03:20:00.349 align:start position:0%
did hear him raise that issue before the
break

03:20:00.349 --> 03:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
break
 
03:20:02.090 --> 03:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
um and we would be happy to work with
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
with you on if there are explore ways if
 
03:20:06.590 --> 03:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
there are ways to do that
 
03:20:06.600 --> 03:20:07.670 align:start position:0%
there are ways to do that
um

03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
I think it would be kind of a group a
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
group effort with folks here to me that
 
03:20:13.190 --> 03:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's there's like different people
 
03:20:14.809 --> 03:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
that inspect for different things and if
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
you just have one person that can
 
03:20:17.450 --> 03:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
inspect for everything yeah it kind of
 
03:20:18.830 --> 03:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
just like makes it way easier on it
 
03:20:21.290 --> 03:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
every everybody yes I'm not I'm not I'm
 
03:20:23.690 --> 03:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
not an expert or familiar with it you
 
03:20:25.849 --> 03:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
know all of those rules and regs and how
 
03:20:27.230 --> 03:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
the inspection process works so I
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to comment too much on it
 
03:20:29.690 --> 03:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
but I would just say that we'd be
 
03:20:32.450 --> 03:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
willing to work with whoever to try to
 
03:20:33.889 --> 03:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
figure out ways to streamline that
 
03:20:33.899 --> 03:20:35.690 align:start position:0%
figure out ways to streamline that
process

03:20:35.690 --> 03:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
um that seems to make sense it would
 
03:20:39.170 --> 03:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
help the developer or the property owner
 
03:20:40.610 --> 03:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
but even the tenants so that they're not
 
03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
letting people into their house
 
03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
constantly in their home Mr chair well
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
one of the issues is that um your
 
03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
funding sources have inspections too so
 
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know I could have a property with
 
03:20:53.690 --> 03:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
low income insurance and tax credits
 
03:20:55.550 --> 03:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
they'll do an inspection if it has had
 
03:20:58.190 --> 03:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
money they'll do an inspection if I have
 
03:20:59.929 --> 03:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
Federal Home Loan Bank
 
03:21:03.530 --> 03:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
um as a mother T then um that mortgage
 
03:21:05.630 --> 03:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
yard then that would require an
 
03:21:10.010 --> 03:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
something to think about absolutely
 
03:21:14.809 --> 03:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for Don
 
03:21:18.050 --> 03:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:22.490 --> 03:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:22.500 --> 03:21:28.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:21:28.130 --> 03:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:28.140 --> 03:21:30.889 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:21:30.889 --> 03:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:21:30.899 --> 03:21:32.450 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

03:21:32.450 --> 03:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead well if you consider the uh the
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
residents of these properties getting a
 
03:21:40.190 --> 03:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
seems like it might be a you know every
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
other month type of an inspection that
 
03:21:44.929 --> 03:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
seems like an unnecessary intrusion and
 
03:21:46.670 --> 03:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps a
 
03:21:49.809 --> 03:21:49.819 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment violation in a class
 
03:21:54.170 --> 03:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:56.570 --> 03:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
all right well um with that I want to

03:23:58.670 --> 03:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh

03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
role of New Hampshire housing in the
 
03:24:03.889 --> 03:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
state that I know representative Gibbs
 
03:24:06.650 --> 03:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
just mentioned as well as a lot of the
 
03:24:08.510 --> 03:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
data that could really help serve this
 
03:24:10.729 --> 03:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
committee as you assess where you would
 
03:24:13.370 --> 03:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
like to go in the policy proposals that
 
03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
you would like to bring forward so
 
03:24:18.290 --> 03:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's the plan so my part will be
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
pretty brief so housing action New
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is an advocacy Coalition I
 
03:24:25.969 --> 03:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time talking to you here
 
03:24:28.809 --> 03:24:28.819 align:start position:0%
at the state house we focus at
 
03:24:31.490 --> 03:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
improving state and federal policy so
 
03:24:33.290 --> 03:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
everyone in New Hampshire has a place to
 
03:24:35.809 --> 03:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
call home our members and I've handed
 
03:24:38.450 --> 03:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
out a list of our members to you are
 
03:24:40.490 --> 03:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
those who develop finance and manage
 
03:24:42.769 --> 03:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
affordable housing properties and as I
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
said Robert torney's here he's one of
 
03:24:45.650 --> 03:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
our members
 
03:24:48.250 --> 03:24:48.260 align:start position:0%
um and also the public housing agency
 
03:24:50.450 --> 03:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
homeless service providers and
 
03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing agencies so a lot of
 
03:24:55.250 --> 03:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
the issues so we are your key Partners
 
03:24:57.889 --> 03:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
in trying to build our way out of this
 
03:25:00.530 --> 03:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
crisis and we applaud your focus on
 
03:25:02.450 --> 03:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
addressing the supply issue because we
 
03:25:05.450 --> 03:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
are very much experiencing a crisis
 
03:25:08.330 --> 03:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of Supply so that's
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
who we are and this is a budget year and
 
03:25:13.309 --> 03:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
so I've handed to you a presentation
 
03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
that I've been giving about our
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
priorities there are many many housing
 
03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
bills and we know that many people were
 
03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
who are serving now in the legislature
 
03:25:28.070 --> 03:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
talked with their constituents in their
 
03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
communities about the housing crisis and
 
03:25:32.030 --> 03:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
they have come to serve in this
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions with a lot of
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
proposals and there are a lot of bills
 
03:25:36.050 --> 03:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them are very good
 
03:25:38.269 --> 03:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
proposals but with a presentation I gave
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
you are kind of the major priorities of
 
03:25:44.450 --> 03:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
our Coalition and one of those bills has
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
a lot to do with the supply issue and
 
03:25:49.309 --> 03:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
that bill is in the Senate right now it
 
03:25:51.889 --> 03:25:51.899 align:start position:0%
has a hearing on Tuesday and that is a
 
03:25:53.809 --> 03:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
lot of the funding mechanisms and I know
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
that you're aware that and maybe I know
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat controversial but in
 
03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
that body in that chamber they tend to
 
03:26:02.690 --> 03:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
debate their funding bills table them
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then include them in their version
 
03:26:06.530 --> 03:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
of the budget of nhb1 and hb2 and then
 
03:26:07.849 --> 03:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
it comes back to you in Committee of
 
03:26:10.250 --> 03:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
conference so this committee will have
 
03:26:12.769 --> 03:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
you know an understanding of the funding
 
03:26:14.809 --> 03:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
proposals that are in Senator innis's
 
03:26:16.190 --> 03:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
Bill and that's in that presentation
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
there's also a new home ownership fund
 
03:26:20.570 --> 03:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
being proposed that would be
 
03:26:22.510 --> 03:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
administered by Ben shop
 
03:26:25.250 --> 03:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
and our members are interested in
 
03:26:28.610 --> 03:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
getting into starter home and a more
 
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
affordable home ownership opportunities
 
03:26:33.229 --> 03:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
and that's Senator rashardi's Bill that
 
03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
had its uh hearing last week and in its
 
03:26:39.530 --> 03:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
policy Committee in Commerce got a 5-0
 
03:26:41.570 --> 03:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
out of pass recommendation go to the
 
03:26:43.969 --> 03:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
floor and then go to Senate finance my
 
03:26:46.429 --> 03:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
guess is that also probably if it if it
 
03:26:49.309 --> 03:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
passes would probably also be tabled
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and come to you through the budget
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
Bill and um the other major
 
03:26:57.530 --> 03:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
policy bill that we're very focused on
 
03:26:59.389 --> 03:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
also came up in your committee this
 
03:27:01.610 --> 03:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
morning and that is a housing Champions
 
03:27:04.150 --> 03:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
proposal and this is an Innovative
 
03:27:06.710 --> 03:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
partnership between the state and
 
03:27:08.809 --> 03:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
municipalities and a number of business
 
03:27:10.610 --> 03:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
interests have come together including
 
03:27:12.650 --> 03:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
the business and industry Association
 
03:27:15.290 --> 03:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
the bankers the Realtors who I know you
 
03:27:17.570 --> 03:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
heard from this morning restaurant and
 
03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
Lodging Association and the auto dealers
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
and the municipal Association and us
 
03:27:26.090 --> 03:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
to move forward a proposal that your
 
03:27:28.190 --> 03:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
chairman worked on in 2019 as part of
 
03:27:30.889 --> 03:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
the governor's housing task force that
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
is what would it look like to
 
03:27:32.819 --> 03:27:34.450 align:start position:0%
is what would it look like to
incentivize

03:27:34.450 --> 03:27:34.460 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
03:27:37.550 --> 03:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities to respond and reward
 
03:27:39.290 --> 03:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
those who are ready to meet this Market
 
03:27:41.570 --> 03:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
need so that's the big overview of the
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
policy and what we do and so now I think
 
03:27:44.929 --> 03:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
I would just um like to give the
 
03:27:47.450 --> 03:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
microphone over to our member Rob oh go
 
03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%

um and Robert we'll talk to you like
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
where the
 
03:27:54.050 --> 03:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
um bricks meet the mortar so to speak
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
and act what it takes to get something
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%

03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Alyssa thank you very much uh
 
03:28:10.309 --> 03:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
as Alyssa mentioned my name is Robert
 
03:28:12.950 --> 03:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
Turney and I'm the executive director of
 
03:28:15.170 --> 03:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
neighborworks Southern New Hampshire uh
 
03:28:16.969 --> 03:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
private non-profit Community Development
 
03:28:19.309 --> 03:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
Corporation with a focus on providing
 
03:28:22.010 --> 03:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
affordable housing we've been around for
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
about 30 years I've been the director
 
03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
there for now for 18 years and over
 
03:28:28.370 --> 03:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
those over that period of time we've
 
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
developed over 500 units of affordable
 
03:28:32.210 --> 03:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
rental housing
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
and assisted literally thousands of
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
families purchase a home of their own
 
03:28:38.090 --> 03:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
and so very familiar with the
 
03:28:40.190 --> 03:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
development approval process in many of
 
03:28:41.330 --> 03:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
the jurisdictions in New Hampshire
 
03:28:44.030 --> 03:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire as well as the
 
03:28:45.889 --> 03:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
financing and mechanism that it takes to
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
develop affordable housing in New
 
03:28:51.410 --> 03:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so I'm very pleased that
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
we have this committee and that housing
 
03:28:56.690 --> 03:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
is on everyone's agenda because it's
 
03:28:58.429 --> 03:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
really really an important issue and
 
03:29:00.830 --> 03:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
really a challenging one for us
 
03:29:03.170 --> 03:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
um I'll begin by saying that
 
03:29:06.290 --> 03:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
we have um I I have made lots of
 
03:29:07.969 --> 03:29:07.979 align:start position:0%
presentations to a lot of different
 
03:29:09.950 --> 03:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
communities over the years planning
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
boards Town councils Boards of Selectmen
 
03:29:14.450 --> 03:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
Economic Development task Forces school
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
boards even uh anyone in a town who will
 
03:29:18.769 --> 03:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
listen about the particular need for
 
03:29:20.090 --> 03:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in their community
 
03:29:22.429 --> 03:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
and how they can how we can help that
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
town address their challenges and their
 
03:29:26.809 --> 03:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
needs and I've always had sort of this
 
03:29:29.389 --> 03:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
recipe or formula that I followed and
 
03:29:31.849 --> 03:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
said if if we can come into the town and
 
03:29:34.389 --> 03:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
have access to density
 
03:29:37.729 --> 03:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
to to achieve enough density to make a
 
03:29:40.130 --> 03:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
project feasible which would most likely
 
03:29:42.410 --> 03:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
rely on having access to public water
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
and public sewer we can go to New
 
03:29:48.410 --> 03:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing the Federal Bank as
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier the Community
 
03:29:52.250 --> 03:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
Development Finance Authority a handful
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
of funding sources and we can make a
 
03:29:55.969 --> 03:29:55.979 align:start position:0%
project happen in your community and and
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
it can be affordable I I can't rely on
 
03:30:01.330 --> 03:30:01.340 align:start position:0%
that recipe anymore the last few years
 
03:30:04.130 --> 03:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
just the costs us associated with
 
03:30:07.250 --> 03:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
developing anything have just gone so
 
03:30:10.370 --> 03:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
high Sky High that even with density
 
03:30:12.830 --> 03:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
even with free land sometimes it's still
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
very very challenging to have the end
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
product become affordable I've always
 
03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
said because we use the low income
 
03:30:20.690 --> 03:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit to finance what we do
 
03:30:22.849 --> 03:30:22.859 align:start position:0%
they don't sell low income two by fours
 
03:30:24.530 --> 03:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
at Lowe's we pay the same for building
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
materials as everybody else and so
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's not a difference in quality in
 
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
the end product and so we really do have
 
03:30:31.020 --> 03:30:32.090 align:start position:0%
the end product and so we really do have
to

03:30:32.090 --> 03:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
um you know maintain a good quality
 
03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
project to be able to last and be
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
durable for a long period of time and uh
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
and maintain a good quality of life for
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
the families that live there and so
 
03:30:44.389 --> 03:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
our organization is at a very successful
 
03:30:46.729 --> 03:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
track record starting in the city of
 
03:30:49.130 --> 03:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
Manchester we are also in the city of
 
03:30:51.410 --> 03:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
Nashua and we've developed projects in
 
03:30:53.870 --> 03:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
the towns of Goffstown and Hooksett and
 
03:30:56.929 --> 03:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Amherst and Merrimack and
 
03:30:59.269 --> 03:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
just to give you a perspective of where
 
03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
costs have gone in the last couple of
 
03:31:03.290 --> 03:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
years we
 
03:31:05.210 --> 03:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
um our last project was in the town of
 
03:31:06.889 --> 03:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and our total development cost
 
03:31:08.990 --> 03:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
was around 260
 
03:31:12.910 --> 03:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
000 per unit all in land infrastructure
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
soft costs architecture engineering
 
03:31:17.330 --> 03:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
construction financing fees everything
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
and that was our total development cost
 
03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
per unit today
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
our construction costs are over 260 000
 
03:31:29.210 --> 03:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
per unit not including the land the soft
 
03:31:32.330 --> 03:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
cost so our our costs of everyone's
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
costs Construction and building and
 
03:31:35.150 --> 03:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
development costs have just gone up
 
03:31:37.130 --> 03:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
exponentially over the last couple of
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
years so that's what contributes to that
 
03:31:41.389 --> 03:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
formula of
 
03:31:43.969 --> 03:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
access to density water and sewer just
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
not being feasible because prices are
 
03:31:48.349 --> 03:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
for everything or have just gone up so
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh so much so exponentially and so it
 
03:31:52.130 --> 03:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
makes it really challenging without
 
03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
resources and so I'm pleased that the
 
03:31:56.510 --> 03:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
state has been able to put funding
 
03:31:58.250 --> 03:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
through the advocacy work of housing
 
03:32:00.130 --> 03:32:00.140 align:start position:0%
action New Hampshire and the support of
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
support of the legislature into the um
 
03:32:06.590 --> 03:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax program uh to
 
03:32:07.849 --> 03:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
fund the affordable housing trust fund
 
03:32:08.809 --> 03:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's administered by New Hampshire
 
03:32:11.870 --> 03:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
housing as uh you know for for many many
 
03:32:13.370 --> 03:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
years I'll tell you I would go to
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
national conferences housing conferences
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
and when State organizations would talk
 
03:32:19.370 --> 03:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
about how much their state cut their
 
03:32:21.170 --> 03:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
budget I would say well our state didn't
 
03:32:22.309 --> 03:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
cut a budget because we don't have a
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
budget to start with so it's it's it's
 
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
quite helpful now to have a budget of
 
03:32:28.490 --> 03:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
State support that that goes into
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
03:32:31.729 --> 03:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
as far as our development approval
 
03:32:31.739 --> 03:32:32.690 align:start position:0%
as far as our development approval
process

03:32:32.690 --> 03:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you it varies widely from
 
03:32:36.070 --> 03:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
Community to community
 
03:32:39.050 --> 03:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
in some jurisdictions
 
03:32:40.309 --> 03:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
um there's there's good coordination
 
03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
from a planning and land use standpoint
 
03:32:45.650 --> 03:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I can say for firsthand that in some
 
03:32:48.410 --> 03:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions it's a big challenge there
 
03:32:51.290 --> 03:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
are some pretty big gaps between
 
03:32:51.300 --> 03:32:52.130 align:start position:0%
are some pretty big gaps between
um

03:32:52.130 --> 03:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:54.769 --> 03:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
written codes and written ordinances and
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
and what is expected of the developer
 
03:32:59.630 --> 03:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
and so it can take an enormous amount of
 
03:33:02.090 --> 03:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
time and money to get through the
 
03:33:04.250 --> 03:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
planning approval process you know I can
 
03:33:06.170 --> 03:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
hire an architect to design a building
 
03:33:06.180 --> 03:33:08.570 align:start position:0%
hire an architect to design a building
that

03:33:08.570 --> 03:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:33:11.330 --> 03:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
is code compliant and I can hire an
 
03:33:13.969 --> 03:33:13.979 align:start position:0%
architect an engineer to design a
 
03:33:17.570 --> 03:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
subdivision or development plans that
 
03:33:19.610 --> 03:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
meet the spirit of the ordinance and we
 
03:33:21.050 --> 03:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
submit them to the town and then the
 
03:33:23.210 --> 03:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
town comes back and says but we want
 
03:33:24.889 --> 03:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
this we want this we want this and we
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
want this and those aren't necessarily
 
03:33:28.190 --> 03:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
in their ordinance but they're going to
 
03:33:30.889 --> 03:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
make us do them and there's often times
 
03:33:32.929 --> 03:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
very little
 
03:33:32.939 --> 03:33:34.010 align:start position:0%
very little
uh

03:33:34.010 --> 03:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:36.050 --> 03:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
I would say there's no consideration as
 
03:33:39.050 --> 03:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
to what cost that may impose on the
 
03:33:40.510 --> 03:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
development project
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the the the justification or
 
03:33:45.769 --> 03:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
the reasoning if for those additional
 
03:33:49.130 --> 03:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
changes are Public Safety
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
and my response is you know well if your
 
03:33:53.330 --> 03:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
codes are insufficient you should update
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
your codes not just add to them on the
 
03:34:00.050 --> 03:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
spot and so I will say that I was a
 
03:34:01.969 --> 03:34:01.979 align:start position:0%
supporter of the creation of the housing
 
03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
appeals board a few years ago not
 
03:34:06.769 --> 03:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
because I want to use it because I don't
 
03:34:08.990 --> 03:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
I've never had an opportunity to use it
 
03:34:11.090 --> 03:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
and I hope I never do but
 
03:34:12.889 --> 03:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
um I was a proponent of it for for that
 
03:34:14.330 --> 03:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
reason because there are many times
 
03:34:16.969 --> 03:34:16.979 align:start position:0%
where I feel like we are unjustifiably
 
03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
being held to a standard that
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
um is beyond
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
be beyond the law but beyond the
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
requirement uh set by the jurisdiction
 
03:34:27.290 --> 03:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I can't say that this is true in
 
03:34:30.290 --> 03:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
every single Community because it varies
 
03:34:33.050 --> 03:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
widely from town to town and so I often
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
say to individuals who
 
03:34:37.250 --> 03:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
quote back to me that it's about local
 
03:34:40.190 --> 03:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
control I oftentimes feel like local
 
03:34:42.050 --> 03:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
control in some communities boils down
 
03:34:44.330 --> 03:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
to one person and one individual and
 
03:34:46.130 --> 03:34:46.140 align:start position:0%
that one individual has all the control
 
03:34:48.769 --> 03:34:48.779 align:start position:0%
to make and to dictate what we can do
 
03:34:51.290 --> 03:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
for our projects and so it can
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes be a challenge so I know that
 
03:34:56.210 --> 03:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
the I know that there has been a toolbox
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislation to help
 
03:34:58.800 --> 03:35:02.050 align:start position:0%
legislation to help
um

03:35:02.050 --> 03:35:02.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:05.630 --> 03:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
improve our uh the training and
 
03:35:07.370 --> 03:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
education that goes along with being in
 
03:35:10.969 --> 03:35:10.979 align:start position:0%
a in a land use decision process and so
 
03:35:13.309 --> 03:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
um anything to help I guess educate and
 
03:35:16.429 --> 03:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
inform uh local bodies local committees
 
03:35:19.250 --> 03:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
about the process I'm all for it and
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
like I said I I spent many of my first
 
03:35:25.010 --> 03:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
years at neighborworks because our our
 
03:35:26.809 --> 03:35:26.819 align:start position:0%
history our history was working uh
 
03:35:28.130 --> 03:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
predominantly in the city of Manchester
 
03:35:30.349 --> 03:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
and so to get into some of the more
 
03:35:32.210 --> 03:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
Suburban towns it took a lot of
 
03:35:34.490 --> 03:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
education and information because if you
 
03:35:35.929 --> 03:35:35.939 align:start position:0%
can imagine
 
03:35:37.969 --> 03:35:37.979 align:start position:0%
um a high density
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
um multi-family project in the city of
 
03:35:41.450 --> 03:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
Manchester that's not necessarily going
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
to work in some of the Suburban towns so
 
03:35:45.050 --> 03:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
I did need to spend a lot of time
 
03:35:47.690 --> 03:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
speaking to the volunteer committees the
 
03:35:49.250 --> 03:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
planning staff whoever would listen to
 
03:35:51.050 --> 03:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
me uh in these surrounding towns about
 
03:35:53.330 --> 03:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
what affordable housing is how we can go
 
03:35:55.130 --> 03:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
about delivering it and how it's not
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily a bad thing for your
 
03:35:59.150 --> 03:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
community it's really an essential tool
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
that the market isn't addressed and so
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
they don't want to drone on too long I
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
want to give Ben a chance to to talk but
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
I would certainly entertain any
 
03:36:10.070 --> 03:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
questions or if you had anything
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
specific that you'd like to ask me so
 
03:36:16.429 --> 03:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to speak with us my
 
03:36:18.530 --> 03:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
question is on um there's a lot of
 
03:36:20.210 --> 03:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
improvements that were made through the
 
03:36:21.769 --> 03:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
community toolbox Bill last year some
 
03:36:22.910 --> 03:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
got through through a committee
 
03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:24.170 align:start position:0%
got through through a committee
conference

03:36:24.170 --> 03:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
conference
 
03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I believe Ben canson Ben knows more
 
03:36:28.490 --> 03:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
about what actually got through
 
03:36:29.690 --> 03:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of the things that you're
 
03:36:31.729 --> 03:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
bringing up like uh streamline approval
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
process transparency of fees training
 
03:36:36.530 --> 03:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
not mandatory but training like some of
 
03:36:37.790 --> 03:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
that stuff got through some of it didn't
 
03:36:39.590 --> 03:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
can you tell me if there's been any I
 
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
mean it's very new but if there's any
 
03:36:44.450 --> 03:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
effect on the way towns respond yeah I
 
03:36:46.250 --> 03:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
would say it's it's still too new I
 
03:36:47.570 --> 03:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
think it's going to take a little time
 
03:36:52.190 --> 03:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
for um uh for for towns to um
 
03:36:55.070 --> 03:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
I guess move forward and it may take a
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
lot longer for some other towns to move
 
03:36:57.239 --> 03:36:58.550 align:start position:0%
lot longer for some other towns to move
forward

03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't know and I don't always
 
03:37:02.929 --> 03:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
think that it's the uh on the on the
 
03:37:06.050 --> 03:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
planning side so in some instances we've
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
moved we've we've we've moved um
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
relatively quite expeditiously through
 
03:37:14.450 --> 03:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
the planning process and
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
um I may sound like a broken record
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
because I've said this at many many
 
03:37:19.790 --> 03:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's always a disconnect between the
 
03:37:22.490 --> 03:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
fire jurisdiction and the and the uh and
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
the building and planning jurisdiction I
 
03:37:27.170 --> 03:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
I would say that that's kind of a
 
03:37:29.809 --> 03:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
um synonymous across communities and so
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
we may make it through the planning
 
03:37:32.809 --> 03:37:32.819 align:start position:0%
process and we make it make it through
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
the planning division but fire moves at
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
their own pace and
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
um we'll come back with changes that
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
mean might mean you need to start over
 
03:37:43.849 --> 03:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
or you might need to add significant
 
03:37:46.010 --> 03:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
things to your project that are going to
 
03:37:48.290 --> 03:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
cost a lot more and so I don't know how
 
03:37:50.269 --> 03:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
that I don't know how to break that I
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
don't know how to change that I know in
 
03:37:52.969 --> 03:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
some jurisdictions they've moved
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
building Under Fire as opposed to under
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
planning but um but I'm not sure how to
 
03:38:01.070 --> 03:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
how to rectify that but but it's
 
03:38:02.450 --> 03:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
definitely an issue and something on my
 
03:38:04.250 --> 03:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
agenda is to is to bring in code
 
03:38:05.630 --> 03:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
enforcers because I want to know like
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
once once an approval is made by the
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
03:38:12.290 --> 03:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
then like code gets say of it and it
 
03:38:13.490 --> 03:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
kind of just like
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
there there's there's another set of
 
03:38:17.150 --> 03:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
roadblocks right there with code and
 
03:38:19.010 --> 03:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
then does it have to go back to planning
 
03:38:21.290 --> 03:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
in some regards sometimes it might yep
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I do want to bring in and see if
 
03:38:24.530 --> 03:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
there's anything on the code side that
 
03:38:26.450 --> 03:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
we can look at too that might be
 
03:38:28.370 --> 03:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
hindering the process making it slower
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
for that and I do know that housing
 
03:38:31.849 --> 03:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
action I think it was housing action
 
03:38:33.650 --> 03:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
that was responsible for training a few
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
years ago to bring code enforcement and
 
03:38:37.849 --> 03:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
fire officials into sort of the same
 
03:38:40.490 --> 03:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
room around education and cooperation in
 
03:38:42.290 --> 03:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
that in that Avenue
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
um so anything like that I think would
 
03:38:45.469 --> 03:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
be helpful okay any questions
 
03:38:45.479 --> 03:38:48.110 align:start position:0%
be helpful okay any questions
representative

03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:38:49.429 --> 03:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like uh
 
03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh you were implying that maybe the we
 
03:39:00.769 --> 03:39:00.779 align:start position:0%
should also talk to fire in addition to
 
03:39:04.910 --> 03:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
code people and how what um they're
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
seeing as far as maybe plans that get
 
03:39:10.610 --> 03:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
approved that are not you know let's say
 
03:39:12.889 --> 03:39:12.899 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and so have to go back to the drawing
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
board costing everyone time and money
 
03:39:17.880 --> 03:39:19.630 align:start position:0%
board costing everyone time and money
um

03:39:19.630 --> 03:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:21.650 --> 03:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
is an
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
um another
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
I mean one do you agree with that and
 
03:39:28.550 --> 03:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
then two do
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
um also
 
03:39:32.170 --> 03:39:32.180 align:start position:0%
seem to be
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
implying that maybe they're
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for the state to S to
 
03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:41.630 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for the state to S to
say

03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:39:43.550 --> 03:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
that you have some you know your local
 
03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
municipality has some guidelines and
 
03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you feel that those are inadequate
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
that you need to change your regulation
 
03:40:03.290 --> 03:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
before imposing them on new projects or
 
03:40:06.170 --> 03:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
something along those lines as far as to
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you know going in
 
03:40:12.410 --> 03:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
that you're meeting what you need to
 
03:40:15.650 --> 03:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
meet instead of having surprise like
 
03:40:17.330 --> 03:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
doubling the work right you already did
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
them you already designed this now you
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
have to go and redesign it because
 
03:40:22.429 --> 03:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
additional things and I I don't mean to
 
03:40:24.349 --> 03:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
disparage fire departments that's not
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
what I came to do
 
03:40:29.090 --> 03:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
um but but I'm I'm more than implying uh
 
03:40:30.710 --> 03:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you straight up this this is
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
this is a real issue and I'm not the
 
03:40:34.190 --> 03:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
only developer that will that will
 
03:40:36.650 --> 03:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
attest to this but um
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
the code and the regulations need to be
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
clear and upfront and we're going to
 
03:40:44.210 --> 03:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
design and build to that it's the
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
frustrating part that we encounter is
 
03:40:48.530 --> 03:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
that there's all there are all these
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
Unwritten rules in nearly every
 
03:40:52.190 --> 03:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction whether it may it may be
 
03:40:53.929 --> 03:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
the code and building side but
 
03:40:55.610 --> 03:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's it's more on the fire
 
03:40:58.190 --> 03:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
side predominantly I think because Fire
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the time to invest on the
 
03:41:03.710 --> 03:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
front end of your project that we need
 
03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
we need that feedback in response early
 
03:41:07.130 --> 03:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
on as opposed to at the end of the day
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
I'll give you I'll give you a good
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
example of
 
03:41:12.590 --> 03:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
um of how this can happen I got a
 
03:41:14.510 --> 03:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
development approval from the planning
 
03:41:14.520 --> 03:41:15.650 align:start position:0%
development approval from the planning
board

03:41:15.650 --> 03:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:41:17.690 --> 03:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
um the the road ordinance for the town
 
03:41:19.550 --> 03:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
said if your road is more than 900 feet
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
long you have to have a second means of
 
03:41:21.479 --> 03:41:22.370 align:start position:0%
long you have to have a second means of
egress

03:41:22.370 --> 03:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
egress
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so our road was 600 feet long our
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
engineer designed a project with a 600
 
03:41:28.610 --> 03:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
Foot Road to to provide the number of
 
03:41:30.650 --> 03:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
units that we were going to build and
 
03:41:32.090 --> 03:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
after we made it through the planning
 
03:41:34.490 --> 03:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
process the we hadn't gotten through our
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
approval but in the design review of the
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
planning process when all the agencies
 
03:41:40.910 --> 03:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
in this in the town come together the
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
fire said we want a second means of
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
egress and so
 
03:41:47.450 --> 03:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
the ordinance said it's only required on
 
03:41:49.729 --> 03:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
900 foot roads not 600 foot roads in the
 
03:41:51.650 --> 03:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
fire chief that it doesn't matter second
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
means of egress so when we went for
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
approval the night of our approval the
 
03:41:56.690 --> 03:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
planning board chair
 
03:41:58.190 --> 03:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
sitting in his chair in front of his
 
03:42:00.170 --> 03:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
microphone said on the record there's
 
03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
nothing in the ordinance that requires
 
03:42:03.170 --> 03:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
me to make you put in a second means of
 
03:42:05.150 --> 03:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
egress for a 600 foot road but because
 
03:42:06.769 --> 03:42:06.779 align:start position:0%
the fire chief wants it we're going to
 
03:42:08.210 --> 03:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
make that a condition of your approval
 
03:42:09.950 --> 03:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
so my project cost just went up by half
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
a million dollars because now I had to
 
03:42:13.729 --> 03:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
build a second means of egress that was
 
03:42:15.830 --> 03:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
infeasible and unpractical the planning
 
03:42:17.450 --> 03:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
department did not want a second means
 
03:42:19.309 --> 03:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
of egress because of traffic issues so
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
we ended up constructing a gated road
 
03:42:23.570 --> 03:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
that only the fire department has access
 
03:42:26.570 --> 03:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
to that I have to maintain in perpetuity
 
03:42:26.580 --> 03:42:28.190 align:start position:0%
to that I have to maintain in perpetuity
so

03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
it again I don't mean to disparage the
 
03:42:32.570 --> 03:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
fire because it's about Public Safety
 
03:42:34.610 --> 03:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
but it's about having rules and
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
regulations and ordinances in place that
 
03:42:40.610 --> 03:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
we could that can be adhered to and and
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
not changed and made up later on down
 
03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
the road so well that's our job is to
 
03:42:47.330 --> 03:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
find out this kind of
 
03:42:50.450 --> 03:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a simple solution we
 
03:42:52.190 --> 03:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature at the state and the
 
03:42:53.929 --> 03:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
federal level shall not make any
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
retrospective laws it's not
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional as such I think the
 
03:43:00.349 --> 03:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
planning boards and code they have to
 
03:43:02.570 --> 03:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
stick by those ordinances and
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
regulations in place at the time of
 
03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
issuance of said permits and stick to it
 
03:43:10.429 --> 03:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
full stop I too I'm a small time
 
03:43:12.889 --> 03:43:12.899 align:start position:0%
developer and I had run into that hurdle
 
03:43:14.590 --> 03:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
that sometimes turns into a mountain
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
played nice up until now
 
03:43:22.969 --> 03:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
so I I oh I'm sorry can I yeah I I
 
03:43:25.550 --> 03:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
totally agree with that and um
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
you know I walk away from the meeting
 
03:43:29.570 --> 03:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking thinking and you know I
 
03:43:31.010 --> 03:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
want to challenge it I want to fight it
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
I want to but we're a non-profit
 
03:43:34.370 --> 03:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
affordable housing developer and so at
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
the end of the day our mission is to get
 
03:43:37.849 --> 03:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
the project built and provide affordable
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
housing and so for us to go through an
 
03:43:43.150 --> 03:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
appeals process to go through a a a
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
rather difficult mudslinging event with
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the town you've got to ask yourself at
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
the end of the day is it worth it to get
 
03:43:50.809 --> 03:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
to the end result which is why I was a
 
03:43:52.370 --> 03:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
proponent of the housing appeals board
 
03:43:55.969 --> 03:43:55.979 align:start position:0%
so that I think that remedies will be
 
03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
handed down as a result of that like I
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
said I hope it's never me that has to go
 
03:44:03.050 --> 03:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
into that seat but I'm glad it's there
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
for that reason so
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh yeah thank you Mr
 
03:44:11.990 --> 03:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
chair and um thank you for coming in uh
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
he may have just touched on one of the
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
biggest things this committee can
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
probably solve because I see it in my
 
03:44:19.130 --> 03:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
town too uh as a matter of fact I have a
 
03:44:20.929 --> 03:44:20.939 align:start position:0%
bill in public works right now that are
 
03:44:22.670 --> 03:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
addressing a last minute change by the
 
03:44:25.010 --> 03:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
fire department uh it happens all the
 
03:44:28.010 --> 03:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
time I won't belabor it now
 
03:44:30.170 --> 03:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
um but we might want to look at the ahj
 
03:44:32.450 --> 03:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
authority in our fire codes and I would
 
03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
certainly include the fire department in
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
our discussions in the future but a
 
03:44:38.690 --> 03:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
quick question for you while um
 
03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
you did make mention that even if you
 
03:44:42.410 --> 03:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
had the density you had the water you
 
03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
had the sewage and free land
 
03:44:46.969 --> 03:44:46.979 align:start position:0%
it still wouldn't be feasible with the
 
03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
construction costs have you repriced
 
03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
anything since they have kind of
 
03:44:53.870 --> 03:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
plateaued and come down I know it might
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
be too late for some of these projects
 
03:44:57.889 --> 03:44:57.899 align:start position:0%
but yeah I guess my question is are you
 
03:45:00.590 --> 03:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
seeing anything good on the horizon with
 
03:45:02.210 --> 03:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
with the way the prices for Building
 
03:45:04.190 --> 03:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
Products it was and then interest rates
 
03:45:07.070 --> 03:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
went up like seven percent so
 
03:45:10.969 --> 03:45:10.979 align:start position:0%
um so uh yeah I think I mean we you know
 
03:45:12.889 --> 03:45:12.899 align:start position:0%
I was very fortunate that we did not
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
have a new construction project being
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
priced during the pandemic we were
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
wrapping up our our big project in
 
03:45:24.050 --> 03:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
Merrimack in 2020 and so we had locked
 
03:45:26.210 --> 03:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
in prices we only experienced one month
 
03:45:28.010 --> 03:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
delay because of because of building
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
material supply issues and it came in uh
 
03:45:32.690 --> 03:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
relatively on time and on budget we've
 
03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
been doing 101 unit rehab over the last
 
03:45:37.370 --> 03:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
two years that's been very very
 
03:45:39.530 --> 03:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
challenging uh you know it took us
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
almost a year to get kitchen cabinets we
 
03:45:43.130 --> 03:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
had to order our furnaces a year in
 
03:45:45.290 --> 03:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
advance things with electrical
 
03:45:47.090 --> 03:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
components and Metal Products are still
 
03:45:50.330 --> 03:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
really expensive and very short supply a
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
big challenge right now is with utility
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
services providers like evernorth and
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
trying to get your Transformers in place
 
03:45:59.330 --> 03:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
so that you can actually deliver a power
 
03:46:00.889 --> 03:46:00.899 align:start position:0%
to your new building you might have a
 
03:46:01.969 --> 03:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
brand spanking new building with no
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
electricity in it and so um so some
 
03:46:07.969 --> 03:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
things have definitely normalized um or
 
03:46:10.130 --> 03:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
not normalized but price is coming down
 
03:46:13.429 --> 03:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
for drywall and two by fours and plywood
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
that that really peaked during the
 
03:46:18.349 --> 03:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
during the covet pandemic but um now
 
03:46:20.570 --> 03:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
with interest rates where they are I
 
03:46:22.490 --> 03:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
think that that's really gonna
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
have an impact on everything else so so
 
03:46:29.229 --> 03:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
going back to having a 250 000 per unit
 
03:46:32.330 --> 03:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
TDC I don't see returning to that
 
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
anytime soon and so when I say it's not
 
03:46:36.889 --> 03:46:36.899 align:start position:0%
feasible or not practical for us to
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
develop an affordable unit at the end of
 
03:46:41.450 --> 03:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
the day in order to come in under the
 
03:46:43.370 --> 03:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
state's definition of Workforce housing
 
03:46:45.830 --> 03:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
which is 60 of the area median income my
 
03:46:47.809 --> 03:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
rent has to be it can be no more than
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
this and so in order for me to pay for
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
these additional other costs where does
 
03:46:54.650 --> 03:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
the money come from now I have to
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
increase the amount that I have to
 
03:46:55.920 --> 03:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
increase the amount that I have to
borrow

03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
borrow
 
03:46:59.090 --> 03:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
so my debt service goes up the amount of
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
interest I'm paying goes up now I can't
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
make the utility payments the taxes the
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
insurance all of the expenses operating
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
costs Meet The Debt Service and stay
 
03:47:09.650 --> 03:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
under that rent without some other form
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
of subsidy we don't rely heavily on
 
03:47:16.370 --> 03:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
operating subsidies uh you know we just
 
03:47:18.050 --> 03:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
expect our tenants to pay the rent and
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
so in order to be able to deliver that
 
03:47:22.429 --> 03:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
rent uh at an affordable price something
 
03:47:24.170 --> 03:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
has to give on the on the development
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
side and so it would take a built-in
 
03:47:27.889 --> 03:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
subsidy on the front end over and above
 
03:47:28.910 --> 03:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
what we can get from New Hampshire
 
03:47:32.150 --> 03:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
housing's normal programs
 
03:47:34.130 --> 03:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:34.140 --> 03:47:36.170 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you Mr chair
um

03:47:36.170 --> 03:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:37.729 --> 03:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
you you deal with a lot of different
 
03:47:40.490 --> 03:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities and this is going towards
 
03:47:43.250 --> 03:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
finding out after the fact
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
planning boards approved that now you
 
03:47:47.090 --> 03:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
have these expensive changes how many of
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
these towns did you deal with have a
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
technical Review Committee
 
03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
most of the towns we work with there's a
 
03:47:56.210 --> 03:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
good opportunity to do tech review on
 
03:47:58.490 --> 03:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
the front end and honestly some
 
03:48:00.290 --> 03:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
sometimes it does come up at that point
 
03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
where someone will say I know the
 
03:48:04.250 --> 03:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
ordinance says we only have to have a 35
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
foot wide road but we want a 50-foot
 
03:48:09.530 --> 03:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
wide Road at technical review so I guess
 
03:48:11.929 --> 03:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
that's helpful because at least I know
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
before I've invested a couple hundred
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in engineering but
 
03:48:18.769 --> 03:48:18.779 align:start position:0%
still it's it's not written in the
 
03:48:22.250 --> 03:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
origins so but yeah tech reviews is I
 
03:48:23.929 --> 03:48:23.939 align:start position:0%
would say tech review is pretty common
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay in most of the communities we work
 
03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:26.750 align:start position:0%
okay in most of the communities we work
with

03:48:26.750 --> 03:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it's better that they tell you up
 
03:48:30.050 --> 03:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
front instead of shooting you down and
 
03:48:31.849 --> 03:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
then having you come back correct yeah
 
03:48:33.530 --> 03:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
and what's even harder is when you've
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
got a completed building
 
03:48:38.809 --> 03:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
and your enunciators or your sprinklers
 
03:48:38.819 --> 03:48:39.590 align:start position:0%
and your enunciators or your sprinklers
are

03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
not in the right place or inadequate or
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
something and it's like it was designed
 
03:48:46.610 --> 03:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
it was reviewed it was designed to code
 
03:48:48.769 --> 03:48:48.779 align:start position:0%
it was reviewed and then it was inspect
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then upon inspection at the end
 
03:48:52.130 --> 03:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
you're telling me it's wrong and now
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
I've got to go back and move this stuff
 
03:48:55.010 --> 03:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
and so it can be it can be expensive so
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
very expensive any last uh questions
 
03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
before we
 
03:49:02.929 --> 03:49:02.939 align:start position:0%
go out to Ben
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:35.210 --> 03:49:35.220 align:start position:0%

I have a this PowerPoint presentation
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
that I can walk through and it has two
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
basic parts to it one is an introduction
 
03:49:55.250 --> 03:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
to you who New Hampshire housing is uh
 
03:49:56.690 --> 03:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
and the programs that we administer and
 
03:49:58.490 --> 03:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
I've heard a series of questions coming
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
up both this morning I was watching the
 
03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
live stream which is a great service to
 
03:50:05.210 --> 03:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
the public thank you
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
um and there are different questions
 
03:50:08.330 --> 03:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
that came up in this afternoon too as
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
well about the different programs that
 
03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
we administer but then also the second
 
03:50:14.929 --> 03:50:14.939 align:start position:0%
part is look at the market and I know
 
03:50:16.490 --> 03:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
you you got some of that this morning
 
03:50:19.729 --> 03:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
from uh Bob Quinn and Chris Norwood from
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
03:50:23.450 --> 03:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
Realtors and I have some uh different
 
03:50:25.130 --> 03:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
angles on that but also look at the
 
03:50:27.050 --> 03:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
rental market which I don't think they
 
03:50:30.410 --> 03:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.170 --> 03:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
um and I I'll you know happy to take any
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
questions along the way I also recognize
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
time is limited and I really want to
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
hear what it is plenty of time
 
03:50:40.490 --> 03:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I I told he's right out there I told
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
him we're a little behind so okay thanks
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
take your time
 
03:50:47.290 --> 03:50:47.300 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire housing is uh one of
 
03:50:50.690 --> 03:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
many state Housing Finance agencies each
 
03:50:52.610 --> 03:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
state has something similar to us
 
03:50:54.410 --> 03:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
although we're all different in one way
 
03:50:56.750 --> 03:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
or another uh New Hampshire housing was
 
03:50:59.690 --> 03:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature in 1981 and
 
03:51:01.070 --> 03:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
you heard this morning Steve Lewis
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the New Hampshire Housing
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
Commission that was formed in the mid
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
70s along with the New Hampshire housing
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
agency and those two were combined in
 
03:51:12.889 --> 03:51:12.899 align:start position:0%
1981 by the legislature to create the
 
03:51:14.450 --> 03:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
03:51:16.610 --> 03:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
and we have been in existence in that
 
03:51:19.969 --> 03:51:19.979 align:start position:0%
form since 1981.
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh we are
 
03:51:24.170 --> 03:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
um a component unit of state government
 
03:51:25.969 --> 03:51:25.979 align:start position:0%
we're not part of the executive branch
 
03:51:27.769 --> 03:51:27.779 align:start position:0%
we're not a state agency we're not a
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
department of state government but a
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
corporation formed by the legislature to
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
provide financing and administer housing
 
03:51:37.570 --> 03:51:37.580 align:start position:0%
programs for the people of New Hampshire
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
we don't receive and never have receive
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
any operating funding from the state we
 
03:51:46.250 --> 03:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
do administer as I think Robert alluded
 
03:51:48.650 --> 03:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
to Robert Turney alluded to the state's
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing trust fund so that is
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
funded by the legislature we administer
 
03:51:56.210 --> 03:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
that on behalf of the state but we don't
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
take admin out of that it goes all goes
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
to development 100 you see on the first
 
03:52:06.290 --> 03:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
page here our board of directors top
 
03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
left is Chris Norwood who appeared
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
before you this morning he's the chair
 
03:52:12.769 --> 03:52:12.779 align:start position:0%
of our board a couple of our members by
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
Statute represent specific industry
 
03:52:18.610 --> 03:52:18.620 align:start position:0%
sectors so Chris represents real estate
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
Trisha Warren represents a single-family
 
03:52:24.349 --> 03:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
building and Evelyn Welton represents
 
03:52:25.969 --> 03:52:25.979 align:start position:0%
banking so those are by Statute
 
03:52:28.250 --> 03:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
positions that get filled on our board
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
you see also Mike Skelton is on our
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
board of directors the executive
 
03:52:34.610 --> 03:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
director and CEO of the business and
 
03:52:36.650 --> 03:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
industry Association
 
03:52:38.750 --> 03:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
our members our board members are
 
03:52:41.210 --> 03:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
nominated by the governor and appointed
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
by the executive Council moving on we
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
have three principal uh lines of
 
03:52:49.250 --> 03:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
business if you will uh one is
 
03:52:52.370 --> 03:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
homeownership and so we uh we do not
 
03:52:55.969 --> 03:52:55.979 align:start position:0%
deal directly with home buyers we work
 
03:52:59.889 --> 03:52:59.899 align:start position:0%
with a a group of Mortgage Bankers
 
03:53:02.690 --> 03:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
mortgage Originators and local and
 
03:53:05.889 --> 03:53:05.899 align:start position:0%
Regional Banks which originate the loans
 
03:53:08.389 --> 03:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes in their name sometimes in our
 
03:53:10.849 --> 03:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
name uh and so we're they're the ones
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
who are the the boots on the ground if
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
you will of uh doing the mortgage work
 
03:53:18.349 --> 03:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
we then acquire those mortgages uh from
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
the the mortgage Originators or we close
 
03:53:24.170 --> 03:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
them in our own name and then we sell
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
them into the secondary market so we're
 
03:53:28.490 --> 03:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
in a kind of an aggregator of mortgages
 
03:53:31.849 --> 03:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
but we offer a wide range of mortgage
 
03:53:34.370 --> 03:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
programs that are really targeted to
 
03:53:37.309 --> 03:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
principally the first time home buyer
 
03:53:39.170 --> 03:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
not exclusively but principally the
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
first time home buyer
 
03:53:44.809 --> 03:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
um and our job by Statute is to find
 
03:53:46.969 --> 03:53:46.979 align:start position:0%
those places where the private Market
 
03:53:50.210 --> 03:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't really work that well and the
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
first time home buyer is a really good
 
03:53:55.610 --> 03:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
example of that so the banks uh who who
 
03:53:58.010 --> 03:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
would do this work uh if they had the
 
03:54:00.769 --> 03:54:00.779 align:start position:0%
the capital and risk profile for it uh
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
use us instead to absorb that
 
03:54:06.410 --> 03:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
um and it's worked really well over the
 
03:54:08.450 --> 03:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
past 40 years
 
03:54:10.670 --> 03:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
so you see our mortgage programs how
 
03:54:13.610 --> 03:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
much we we have done in the in the past
 
03:54:16.610 --> 03:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and some of the um some of
 
03:54:18.950 --> 03:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
the data associated with that
 
03:54:18.960 --> 03:54:19.610 align:start position:0%
the data associated with that
um

03:54:19.610 --> 03:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
we also
 
03:54:25.130 --> 03:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
and there's actually
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I skipped over I flipped to page
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
page the next page multi-family Housing
 
03:54:33.830 --> 03:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
Finance uh so uh Robert turini uh and
 
03:54:35.530 --> 03:54:35.540 align:start position:0%
the folks from Elm Grove talked about
 
03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
the low income housing tax credit that
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
is a U.S treasury program not HUD but
 
03:54:42.650 --> 03:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
treasury program that we administer on
 
03:54:46.370 --> 03:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
behalf of the treasury so we are the uh
 
03:54:49.010 --> 03:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
the um the allocator of the federal
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit for New
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that is
 
03:54:55.130 --> 03:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and Across the
 
03:54:57.889 --> 03:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
Nation it is the principal source of
 
03:54:59.809 --> 03:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
development capital for low-income
 
03:55:02.210 --> 03:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
housing rental construction Ben do you
 
03:55:04.729 --> 03:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
Mr Frosty do the um inspections for that
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
too we do so we we have an asset
 
03:55:09.530 --> 03:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
management division we have a in our
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing division we have uh
 
03:55:12.889 --> 03:55:12.899 align:start position:0%
an asset management group and a
 
03:55:14.210 --> 03:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
Development Group the Development Group
 
03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
originates these projects um and works
 
03:55:20.210 --> 03:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
with the developers to make them work uh
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
and you know to find the gaps in
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
financing and we also as as Robert I'm
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
sure we'll attest we have some really
 
03:55:27.950 --> 03:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
rigorous designing construction
 
03:55:31.010 --> 03:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
standards so we compel developers to
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
build to a very high quality because
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is an asset that we want to last
 
03:55:38.090 --> 03:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
for a long time because our asset
 
03:55:39.769 --> 03:55:39.779 align:start position:0%
management group is looking at this
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
stuff over time uh doing the the annual
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
inspections doing the unit inspections
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
inspecting the books on each and every
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
development to make sure that they're
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
financially solvent
 
03:55:54.290 --> 03:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
um we have and we uh administer if we
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
have in our portfolio something like 400
 
03:56:00.769 --> 03:56:00.779 align:start position:0%
projects uh totaling uh roughly 5 000
 
03:56:03.050 --> 03:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
housing units across the state
 
03:56:05.570 --> 03:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh we have not foreclosed on a
 
03:56:09.250 --> 03:56:09.260 align:start position:0%
multi-family project since the mid-1980s
 
03:56:13.610 --> 03:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
and those we foreclose on two one was in
 
03:56:14.929 --> 03:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
Franklin it was a project that we
 
03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
assumed from the Franklin housing
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
authority and it was just not in good
 
03:56:20.870 --> 03:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
shape the other one was a a project in
 
03:56:22.729 --> 03:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
Peterborough that
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
um I think was ill-advised from the the
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
get-go but not since the 1980s have we
 
03:56:29.809 --> 03:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
foreclosed on any multi-family housing
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
developments that we Finance which I
 
03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
think is a testament to the the rigor
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
with which we underwrite the projects uh
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
they they if they're not sound they're
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
not going to go forward
 
03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
and here's an example this is a slide
 
03:56:46.130 --> 03:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
four on the second page of some of the
 
03:56:48.469 --> 03:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
the projects that we financed
 
03:56:48.479 --> 03:56:50.929 align:start position:0%
the projects that we financed
um

03:56:50.929 --> 03:56:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
we talked about the home ownership
 
03:56:54.950 --> 03:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
programs the last business line division
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
that we have is the assisted housing
 
03:56:58.130 --> 03:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
division and there's been some
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
discussion with earlier speakers about
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
the housing Choice voucher program we
 
03:57:06.050 --> 03:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
are a public housing agency under
 
03:57:09.229 --> 03:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
federal law uh but we we don't own and
 
03:57:10.969 --> 03:57:10.979 align:start position:0%
operate public housing we are a what's
 
03:57:13.610 --> 03:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
known as a voucher only public housing
 
03:57:13.620 --> 03:57:14.630 align:start position:0%
known as a voucher only public housing
agency

03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
agency
 
03:57:17.929 --> 03:57:17.939 align:start position:0%
so there are a series of local public
 
03:57:19.969 --> 03:57:19.979 align:start position:0%
housing agencies in New Hampshire that
 
03:57:22.250 --> 03:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
also administer some allocation of
 
03:57:24.170 --> 03:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
housing Choice vouchers we do
 
03:57:26.750 --> 03:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
effectively Statewide the balance of the
 
03:57:30.050 --> 03:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
state and we administer as you see over
 
03:57:32.929 --> 03:57:32.939 align:start position:0%
4 000 housing Choice vouchers there's
 
03:57:35.809 --> 03:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 000 vouchers administered
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide by all of the public housing
 
03:57:39.889 --> 03:57:39.899 align:start position:0%
agencies total
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
we administer that 4200 plus it's
 
03:57:44.450 --> 03:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
actually more like 4 500 because there's
 
03:57:47.150 --> 03:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
a variety of different vouchers I think
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
depending upon the funding source and
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
there's also the the emergency vouchers
 
03:57:53.150 --> 03:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
that were funded through
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
um through arpa not shown here but it's
 
03:57:58.670 --> 03:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
come up in in some in some of the
 
03:58:01.250 --> 03:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
earlier uh speakers discussions with you
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
we we also administer a couple of the
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic related Housing Programs so the
 
03:58:09.370 --> 03:58:09.380 align:start position:0%
emergency rental assistance program
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing that under contract with
 
03:58:11.640 --> 03:58:12.790 align:start position:0%
we're doing that under contract with
gopher

03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
gopher
 
03:58:16.010 --> 03:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
and that is winding down it will be
 
03:58:19.010 --> 03:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
fully closed out by June of this year uh
 
03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
all told this will have provided rental
 
03:58:25.010 --> 03:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
resources to New Hampshire residents in
 
03:58:27.229 --> 03:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
need of those resources something on the
 
03:58:30.410 --> 03:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
order of 250 million dollars all federal
 
03:58:30.420 --> 03:58:32.389 align:start position:0%
order of 250 million dollars all federal
money

03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:58:34.969 --> 03:58:34.979 align:start position:0%
um the other program also mentioned by
 
03:58:36.410 --> 03:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
earlier speakers is the homeowner
 
03:58:38.990 --> 03:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
assistance fund uh and it's pretty
 
03:58:40.490 --> 03:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory it's to provide
 
03:58:42.410 --> 03:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
assistance to homeowners who are
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing difficulties uh as a result
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
of or during covet uh paying their their
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
mortgage paying their utilities paying
 
03:58:51.769 --> 03:58:51.779 align:start position:0%
their property taxes or other property
 
03:58:53.769 --> 03:58:53.779 align:start position:0%
related costs like
 
03:58:56.269 --> 03:58:56.279 align:start position:0%
homeowner association fees and condo
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
fees and things like that
 
03:58:58.140 --> 03:58:58.910 align:start position:0%
fees and things like that
um

03:58:58.910 --> 03:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:01.010 --> 03:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
that will continue to run for a couple
 
03:59:04.849 --> 03:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
of years uh and the the funding uh if
 
03:59:07.490 --> 03:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's a total of 50 million dollars and
 
03:59:10.010 --> 03:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
that that is moving relatively slowly I
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
think in part because of the uh the
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
controls that we put on the program so
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
we're requiring uh if someone is seeking
 
03:59:20.809 --> 03:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
Mortgage Assistance we're requiring them
 
03:59:22.729 --> 03:59:22.739 align:start position:0%
to go through lost mitigation with their
 
03:59:25.250 --> 03:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
mortgage servicer first to see if
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity there to change
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
the terms of the mortgage to meet their
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
needs before they come to this program
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
for assistance and if they have done
 
03:59:35.090 --> 03:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
that and still have problems then
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.640 --> 03:59:39.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:59:39.530 --> 03:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:41.330 --> 03:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
I made a note to myself to cover
 
03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
something that came up when the folks
 
03:59:46.010 --> 03:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
from Elm Grove were talking with you and
 
03:59:48.469 --> 03:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
that's with regard to the housing Choice
 
03:59:50.929 --> 03:59:50.939 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program uh
 
03:59:53.870 --> 03:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it was a Chris schleyer who
 
03:59:57.050 --> 03:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned moving to work and that is a
 
03:59:58.570 --> 03:59:58.580 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
relatively new HUD program something
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
that Congress designed and HUD is is
 
04:00:04.439 --> 04:00:06.410 align:start position:0%
that Congress designed and HUD is is
implementing

04:00:06.410 --> 04:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
implementing
 
04:00:09.229 --> 04:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
um and we were just in the past year
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
designated as a moving to work agency so
 
04:00:14.570 --> 04:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's a competitive we applied for it and
 
04:00:17.570 --> 04:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
were awarded this what that does is it
 
04:00:21.050 --> 04:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
gives us substantial flexibility in how
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
to administer the housing Choice voucher
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
program so for example in the frequency
 
04:00:27.889 --> 04:00:27.899 align:start position:0%
of inspections and it's not every month
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
or even every other month it's you know
 
04:00:32.450 --> 04:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
the the annual inspections we can using
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
a moving to work designation under
 
04:00:36.530 --> 04:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate circumstances we can move
 
04:00:39.650 --> 04:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
that to biennial inspections so if the
 
04:00:41.150 --> 04:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
property is in good shape it doesn't
 
04:00:42.889 --> 04:00:42.899 align:start position:0%
need to be inspected every year unless
 
04:00:44.330 --> 04:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
we get a complaint
 
04:00:46.010 --> 04:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
and if there's and we'll go out and
 
04:00:48.889 --> 04:00:48.899 align:start position:0%
respond to any complaint of a tenant and
 
04:00:51.530 --> 04:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
if we find a violation then we will act
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
on it
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
so that's one example of the flexibility
 
04:00:57.290 --> 04:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
that moving to work designation will
 
04:00:59.570 --> 04:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
give to us
 
04:01:01.130 --> 04:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
the last
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh area that we are active in and it's
 
04:01:06.650 --> 04:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
not a business line division but it's a
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
a group this is the group that I
 
04:01:10.250 --> 04:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
supervise at New Hampshire housing it's
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
our policy planning and Communications
 
04:01:14.330 --> 04:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
Group we do the research planning and
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
advocacy uh and you see listed here a
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
lot of different things uh so for
 
04:01:23.030 --> 04:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
example we are running the invest NH
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal Planning and Zoning grant
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
program on behalf of the Department of
 
04:01:28.969 --> 04:01:28.979 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs that's a
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
five million dollar grant program for
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities to change their zoning to
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
make them
 
04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
more housing friendly
 
04:01:41.210 --> 04:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
the point being to create a regulatory
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
environment at the local level that is
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
more conducive to Housing Development
 
04:01:48.769 --> 04:01:48.779 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you we launched this on
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
August 5th
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
and we have already made over 40 grants
 
04:01:55.809 --> 04:01:55.819 align:start position:0%
to municipalities
 
04:01:59.570 --> 04:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
totaling over 2.1 million dollars the
 
04:02:02.210 --> 04:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
demand for this program is exceedingly
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
High meaning that the municipalities are
 
04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and get it
 
04:02:09.710 --> 04:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
they understand that there's a problem
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
with housing Supply in New Hampshire and
 
04:02:14.090 --> 04:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
they want to be part of the solution not
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
all of them but the ones that certainly
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that we've made granted well
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
let me ask you this then um
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
have those towns you've awarded the
 
04:02:23.150 --> 04:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
grants to have they historically been
 
04:02:25.849 --> 04:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
towns that have been
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying good or bad on housing
 
04:02:30.170 --> 04:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
but like towns have been more open to
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
more development or have they been
 
04:02:33.769 --> 04:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
closed towns it runs the gamut Mr
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
chairman so there are some communities
 
04:02:38.269 --> 04:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
that have been
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
historically less welcoming to Housing
 
04:02:44.210 --> 04:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
Development who are trying to change
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
and an important element of all of these
 
04:02:48.590 --> 04:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
grants is
 
04:02:51.410 --> 04:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
a requirement that they do community
 
04:02:55.370 --> 04:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
engagement that is is really
 
04:02:58.729 --> 04:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
um boots on the ground work with the
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
public to get people to understand get
 
04:03:02.689 --> 04:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
the voters to understand what the issues
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
are and why it's important to do these
 
04:03:06.170 --> 04:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
things you're not going to convince
 
04:03:06.180 --> 04:03:07.250 align:start position:0%
things you're not going to convince
everyone

04:03:07.250 --> 04:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:03:10.130 --> 04:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
but if you can convince a significant
 
04:03:12.170 --> 04:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
majority of people who are going to show
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
up at the polls on town meeting day then
 
04:03:18.170 --> 04:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
yes you're a much better position to
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
um and then there are others that have
 
04:03:24.170 --> 04:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
just been doing the right thing for a
 
04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
while and they want to do more of it
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
which is great
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
um we also do a great variety of studies
 
04:03:31.729 --> 04:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
and reports and I'll touch on those a
 
04:03:33.050 --> 04:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
little bit later
 
04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
um and conferences and I think you've
 
04:03:37.729 --> 04:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
all received an invitation to our home
 
04:03:40.189 --> 04:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
ownership conference on March 8th in
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
Bedford at the Manchester Country Club
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
it's all morning it's a great program I
 
04:03:47.090 --> 04:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
know you it might be a session day and I
 
04:03:49.130 --> 04:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
apologize so I actually wanted to make
 
04:03:50.630 --> 04:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
this an off-site meeting of the special
 
04:03:52.189 --> 04:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
committee but unfortunately there's
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
other committees that are meeting that
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
day here in Concord I don't think it's
 
04:03:57.410 --> 04:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
going to be a session day but if there's
 
04:03:58.969 --> 04:03:58.979 align:start position:0%
some things that maybe you could bring
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
like presentations to us on another day
 
04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to entertain that
 
04:04:05.809 --> 04:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
be happy to do that we're not recording
 
04:04:08.689 --> 04:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
the conference but I can tell you
 
04:04:11.450 --> 04:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
um two of the speakers that we have John
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
and Maggie Randolph now you might have
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
seen on wmmur recently they are the ones
 
04:04:17.929 --> 04:04:17.939 align:start position:0%
doing the I won't call them tiny houses
 
04:04:20.330 --> 04:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
but they are tiny houses small homes in
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
Dover for their employees they're the
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
owners of Harmony Homes which is
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
long-term long-term care facilities in
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
Durham and I think also Dover and maybe
 
04:04:32.450 --> 04:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
elsewhere too and they were finding they
 
04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
just they couldn't hire people because
 
04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
the people couldn't afford to move here
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't afford they
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a place to live so they
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
said well why don't we build something
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
and working cooperatively with the city
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
of Dover they were able to build in this
 
04:04:48.889 --> 04:04:48.899 align:start position:0%
is under construction now and I think
 
04:04:53.570 --> 04:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
nearing ready for occupancy I think 43
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
um single units that are for rent for
 
04:04:59.929 --> 04:04:59.939 align:start position:0%
their employees principally but also for
 
04:05:03.889 --> 04:05:03.899 align:start position:0%
others and these are roughly 450 square
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
feet plus Loft area they they're going
 
04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
to be speaking at our conference I
 
04:05:11.570 --> 04:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
encourage you to invite them to speak to
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
the committee I was looking at the
 
04:05:15.170 --> 04:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
agenda and the presentations I don't
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
know if any we all received the email
 
04:05:18.530 --> 04:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
there's some great presentations on that
 
04:05:19.969 --> 04:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
list so if there's anybody interested we
 
04:05:21.769 --> 04:05:21.779 align:start position:0%
can invite them to testify
 
04:05:23.870 --> 04:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
right I'd be happy to do that now
 
04:05:25.490 --> 04:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
quickly just taking a look at the market
 
04:05:27.889 --> 04:05:27.899 align:start position:0%
I don't want to repeat what the folks
 
04:05:30.110 --> 04:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
from the Realtors uh Association have
 
04:05:32.570 --> 04:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
said but focusing on the the rental
 
04:05:34.969 --> 04:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
market uh annually New Hampshire housing
 
04:05:37.070 --> 04:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
does a residential rental cost survey it
 
04:05:39.769 --> 04:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
is a an extraordinarily robust survey we
 
04:05:41.929 --> 04:05:41.939 align:start position:0%
survey something on the order of 20 000
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
units uh Statewide in collaboration with
 
04:05:47.090 --> 04:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
the UNH Survey Center and other
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
contractors uh who go out and and get uh
 
04:05:53.389 --> 04:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
landlords to respond to this we get
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
really good data on what the rental
 
04:05:57.410 --> 04:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
market is in New Hampshire the best data
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
available and the data show this is a
 
04:06:01.689 --> 04:06:01.699 align:start position:0%
slide 11
 
04:06:04.849 --> 04:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
that the rental costs are going up and
 
04:06:06.889 --> 04:06:06.899 align:start position:0%
up and up if you extend this back in
 
04:06:10.610 --> 04:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
time to like 1995 you would see it's
 
04:06:13.130 --> 04:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
been going up since that time
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
um it was really only in the early 90s
 
04:06:16.610 --> 04:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
that we saw real stability in the rental
 
04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
market and that was because we had such
 
04:06:21.290 --> 04:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
a surplus of of housing that had been
 
04:06:23.570 --> 04:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
built in the 80s and then we had the
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
crash of the late 80s early 90s
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
so but since 1995 rental costs have been
 
04:06:31.370 --> 04:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
going up and there's kind of an
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
acceleration here in this curve
 
04:06:36.410 --> 04:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
things are not getting better we're in
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the the process right now of
 
04:06:41.210 --> 04:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
updating that survey and we will have
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
the results published most likely in
 
04:06:44.040 --> 04:06:46.309 align:start position:0%
the results published most likely in
July

04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
July
 
04:06:48.650 --> 04:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
um and you see also the the vacancy
 
04:06:48.660 --> 04:06:49.610 align:start position:0%
um and you see also the the vacancy
rates

04:06:49.610 --> 04:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
rates
 
04:06:51.410 --> 04:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:06:53.210 --> 04:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
on the next page
 
04:06:55.729 --> 04:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
and I think Don referred to this uh in
 
04:06:57.170 --> 04:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
her testimony
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
um Statewide all units total 0.5 percent
 
04:07:04.969 --> 04:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
um and for two bedroom units which is
 
04:07:08.150 --> 04:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the supply is 0.3 percent
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
and representative of your pillow has a
 
04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
question I think oh representative
 
04:07:14.929 --> 04:07:14.939 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to
 
04:07:16.370 --> 04:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
um clarify when you're saying rental
 
04:07:16.380 --> 04:07:17.570 align:start position:0%
um clarify when you're saying rental
cost

04:07:17.570 --> 04:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:07:21.050 --> 04:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the
 
04:07:21.060 --> 04:07:22.550 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the
um cost

04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
um cost
 
04:07:26.570 --> 04:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
of providing the rental or the cost to
 
04:07:30.889 --> 04:07:30.899 align:start position:0%
the end user the the actual rent of the
 
04:07:33.110 --> 04:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
apartment that is contract rent so that
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
is what the tenant pays okay beautiful
 
04:07:39.650 --> 04:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and we account for very
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes the tenants pay the utilities
 
04:07:44.090 --> 04:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't so we account for
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
that so what we what the result is is
 
04:07:50.330 --> 04:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
the gross rent so rent plus utilities is
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
what we're representing here
 
04:07:54.769 --> 04:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
uh and you see the vacancy rates uh by
 
04:07:57.290 --> 04:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
County things are tough all over doesn't
 
04:07:58.370 --> 04:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
matter where you are in the state
 
04:08:02.090 --> 04:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
there's not enough rental housing
 
04:08:02.100 --> 04:08:03.290 align:start position:0%
there's not enough rental housing
uh

04:08:03.290 --> 04:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:05.570 --> 04:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
the last thing I have on the ranch is
 
04:08:08.150 --> 04:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
really a transition to ownership of the
 
04:08:10.370 --> 04:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
household income by tenure that is
 
04:08:13.490 --> 04:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
ownership versus renters uh and you see
 
04:08:17.210 --> 04:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
how static uh the income has been over
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
time of uh their renter households uh
 
04:08:22.969 --> 04:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
they've just not gone up now no one's
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
income has gone up to keep up with
 
04:08:26.689 --> 04:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
housing costs whether you're on owner or
 
04:08:28.969 --> 04:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
a renter but it's been especially hard
 
04:08:32.269 --> 04:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
for renters what I don't show here is
 
04:08:34.670 --> 04:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
eviction data and and that is available
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
by the uh from the judicial branch
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
they've been reporting on this uh really
 
04:08:42.110 --> 04:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
well that they've just converted how
 
04:08:45.050 --> 04:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
they report that from weekly to monthly
 
04:08:47.809 --> 04:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
so we're kind of sorting through what
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
that looks like I can tell you that the
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
eviction data what they have presented
 
04:08:55.630 --> 04:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
up to now shows that
 
04:08:59.090 --> 04:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
the level of evictions are down somewhat
 
04:09:01.689 --> 04:09:01.699 align:start position:0%
from where they were pre-covered
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
which is a good sign but there's still a
 
04:09:06.290 --> 04:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
significant significant number of
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
evictions going on Statewide and that's
 
04:09:11.090 --> 04:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
really where New Hampshire legal
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
assistance is plays such an important
 
04:09:13.199 --> 04:09:14.750 align:start position:0%
assistance is plays such an important
role

04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
role
 
04:09:17.090 --> 04:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
moving to the purchase site this is kind
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
of repetitious of what the real through
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
said so I won't dwell on this other than
 
04:09:25.790 --> 04:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
to look at this is Slide 19.
 
04:09:28.010 --> 04:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
um the prices
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh and I show you know December 20 to
 
04:09:34.929 --> 04:09:34.939 align:start position:0%
December 22 a 22 increase if we go back
 
04:09:38.450 --> 04:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
pre-covet December 2019.
 
04:09:43.969 --> 04:09:43.979 align:start position:0%
we've seen through December 22 2022 a 48
 
04:09:46.969 --> 04:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
increase in sales prices
 
04:09:49.610 --> 04:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
um this is the median sales price uh so
 
04:09:52.010 --> 04:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
there's a an extraordinary acceleration
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think it was um it may have been Chris
 
04:09:56.150 --> 04:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
Norway this morning we talked about uh
 
04:09:57.650 --> 04:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
the the velocity increasing that's
 
04:10:00.050 --> 04:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
acceleration and you can see kind of the
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
inflection point in this curve around
 
04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
2020 uh where it really took off and
 
04:10:07.550 --> 04:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
this is what we've been hearing about in
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
the news for the past couple years
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh dampened somewhat but not a whole lot
 
04:10:14.990 --> 04:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
by the increase increase in interest
 
04:10:17.150 --> 04:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
rates you know they bottomed out in 20
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
December of 2020 at I think 2.79 which
 
04:10:24.490 --> 04:10:24.500 align:start position:0%
was the lowest this is the Freddie Mac
 
04:10:27.650 --> 04:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
survey of of national mortgage interest
 
04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
rates and that was the lowest they had
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
ever recorded in the 40-year history
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
actually 50-year history of that survey
 
04:10:38.630 --> 04:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
now it's you know six point something
 
04:10:40.849 --> 04:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
percent which seems high
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
but if you compare it to where it was
 
04:10:46.490 --> 04:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
in the early 80s no it's not so bad they
 
04:10:48.050 --> 04:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
have stabilized and that's I think a
 
04:10:50.450 --> 04:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
good thing but they're up and the
 
04:10:51.950 --> 04:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
interest rates are having an impact on
 
04:10:54.769 --> 04:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
people's ability to afford a home so we
 
04:10:56.349 --> 04:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
see a sales down
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
and it's especially difficult for the
 
04:11:01.729 --> 04:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
the buyers that we serve the first time
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.680 --> 04:11:06.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:11:06.050 --> 04:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
also questions came up where where are
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
people coming from and you know Chris
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
Norwich sitting in this chair said I see
 
04:11:13.729 --> 04:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
all the Massachusetts license plates and
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
anybody confessed
 
04:11:16.610 --> 04:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe that's that's what I'm
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
looking for you know if you if you if
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
you look if you think something's
 
04:11:20.689 --> 04:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
happening then you're going to see it
 
04:11:22.969 --> 04:11:22.979 align:start position:0%
happening in fact
 
04:11:26.450 --> 04:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
we have not seen a huge increase in
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
buyers from out of state
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
most of our buyers come from New
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in fact most of the buyers
 
04:11:37.010 --> 04:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire come from the town or
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the proximate region in which they
 
04:11:41.389 --> 04:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
already live whether they already own a
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
home or they're renting most buyers are
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
local to their own markets we have seen
 
04:11:50.929 --> 04:11:50.939 align:start position:0%
a small increase small but I would say
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
statistically significant increase in
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
buyers from out of state and this is
 
04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
part of it's from Massachusetts yeah and
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's the the people decamping the Boston
 
04:12:02.689 --> 04:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
metro area during covid uh and but I
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
think most of those were are coming here
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
and occupying homes that they already
 
04:12:06.359 --> 04:12:07.729 align:start position:0%
and occupying homes that they already
owned

04:12:07.729 --> 04:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
owned
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
and now many of them are going back
 
04:12:10.800 --> 04:12:11.870 align:start position:0%
and now many of them are going back
um

04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:14.689 --> 04:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
it'll be interesting to see what happens
 
04:12:17.689 --> 04:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
to the home buyer profile over time as
 
04:12:20.090 --> 04:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
other places other parts of the country
 
04:12:20.100 --> 04:12:22.490 align:start position:0%
other places other parts of the country
become

04:12:22.490 --> 04:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
become
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
um less great to live in like I'm
 
04:12:26.570 --> 04:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
thinking about the mega drought in the
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
southwest and fires in the Pacific
 
04:12:28.800 --> 04:12:29.950 align:start position:0%
southwest and fires in the Pacific
Northwest

04:12:29.950 --> 04:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
Northwest
 
04:12:32.090 --> 04:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
these are these are things that people
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
are going to be dealing with in the
 
04:12:33.479 --> 04:12:34.490 align:start position:0%
are going to be dealing with in the
future

04:12:34.490 --> 04:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
all of New England is going to be a
 
04:12:40.849 --> 04:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
really great place to live and better in
 
04:12:43.729 --> 04:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
perspective in perspective uh to those
 
04:12:45.769 --> 04:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
changes elsewhere so we might see more
 
04:12:48.410 --> 04:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
of that happening
 
04:12:50.689 --> 04:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
um delinquencies
 
04:12:53.389 --> 04:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
they're down but they're going up you
 
04:12:55.969 --> 04:12:55.979 align:start position:0%
know the forbearance covered related
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
forbearance is ending uh and so we're
 
04:13:01.849 --> 04:13:01.859 align:start position:0%
expecting that to be more of an issue
 
04:13:04.189 --> 04:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
number of people talked about what's the
 
04:13:08.330 --> 04:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
problem the problem is Supply we're
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
simply not building enough housing and
 
04:13:13.010 --> 04:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
if you look at the slide 25 this goes
 
04:13:15.650 --> 04:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
this is building permit data
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
um elected by the office of Planning and
 
04:13:17.760 --> 04:13:19.130 align:start position:0%
um elected by the office of Planning and
Development

04:13:19.130 --> 04:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
Development
 
04:13:22.250 --> 04:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and you see uh where we are
 
04:13:25.070 --> 04:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
the lowest points on this curve are
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
periods of recession 1980 81 82 1991.
 
04:13:30.000 --> 04:13:32.269 align:start position:0%
periods of recession 1980 81 82 1991.
2009

04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
2009
 
04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
we are building at recessionary levels
 
04:13:37.130 --> 04:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
right now and we've been building at
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
recessionary levels during
 
04:13:42.170 --> 04:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
the period of the nation's longest
 
04:13:45.110 --> 04:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
economic expansion in our history
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
this is economically unsustainable for
 
04:13:48.650 --> 04:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
us as a state
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
we need to be building more
 
04:13:52.610 --> 04:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
Chris Norwood said he'd like to see us
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
build build uh four or five thousand
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
units a year
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
I think he's off
 
04:14:00.410 --> 04:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
by a hundred percent I think we need to
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
be building more like nine or ten
 
04:14:05.150 --> 04:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
thousand units a year to meet the demand
 
04:14:06.889 --> 04:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
that we see going forward and to account
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the shortage we have right now
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
how much housing does New Hampshire need
 
04:14:13.969 --> 04:14:13.979 align:start position:0%
great question right now we've got a
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
shortage of something like 23 000 units
 
04:14:19.010 --> 04:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
to get us to a stable Market on the
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
renter side and on the owner's side
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
and this this accounts for this this
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
last slide here counts for
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
um growth in the future population
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
changes household composition changes
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
people moving to the state
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh which we need
 
04:14:35.809 --> 04:14:35.819 align:start position:0%
um you know look look at the well we
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't have one ads anymore but go on
 
04:14:41.150 --> 04:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
indeed and any any uh hiring Pro uh
 
04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
platform and you'll see so many openings
 
04:14:45.889 --> 04:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
talk to any employer talk to the Bia
 
04:14:48.769 --> 04:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you we need workers workers
 
04:14:50.809 --> 04:14:50.819 align:start position:0%
need houses
 
04:14:52.370 --> 04:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
so I end with
 
04:14:55.490 --> 04:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
this offer this question what can we do
 
04:14:57.889 --> 04:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
to help you
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
um we have a really robust research
 
04:15:04.010 --> 04:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
group we have the best source of of
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
housing data in the state if you have
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions we will attempt to answer them
 
04:15:12.650 --> 04:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
just ask we do the the data analysis we
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
do the residential rental cost survey we
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
have data from the Warren group on home
 
04:15:19.130 --> 04:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
purchases which takes the pa34 US from
 
04:15:22.370 --> 04:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
dra and filters them we we look at every
 
04:15:24.530 --> 04:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
D recording in the state
 
04:15:26.450 --> 04:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
and we also do independent research
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
right now we're we're looking at the
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
school costs of new residential
 
04:15:32.210 --> 04:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
construction this is stuff that Russ
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
Tebow had done for us years ago Russ has
 
04:15:38.090 --> 04:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
retired and we have a new firm working
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
with us to look at this you know so and
 
04:15:44.929 --> 04:15:44.939 align:start position:0%
you talked to Robert Turney talked to
 
04:15:46.490 --> 04:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
the folks from Elm Grove and they tell
 
04:15:48.290 --> 04:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
you that there's a lot of resistance
 
04:15:50.570 --> 04:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
locally part of that resistance is all
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
the kids that'll come with this low
 
04:15:54.170 --> 04:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
income housing well let's take a look at
 
04:15:58.610 --> 04:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
the numbers the numbers don't say that
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's actually very few kids that come
 
04:16:02.330 --> 04:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
with any kind of development whether
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's single-family homes or multi-family
 
04:16:07.729 --> 04:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
low-income rental construction typically
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
it's related to the number of bedrooms
 
04:16:13.130 --> 04:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
in a house bigger homes tend to have
 
04:16:14.809 --> 04:16:14.819 align:start position:0%
more kids
 
04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple math we will also be
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the cost the property value
 
04:16:20.760 --> 04:16:22.150 align:start position:0%
looking at the cost the property value
impact

04:16:22.150 --> 04:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
impact
 
04:16:25.010 --> 04:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
on surrounding properties when you build
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
new low-income rental housing this is
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's gonna it's gonna kill my
 
04:16:30.769 --> 04:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
property values
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
not what we've seen elsewhere it
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
actually raises property values but we
 
04:16:37.010 --> 04:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
need to demonstrate that from a New
 
04:16:38.929 --> 04:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire perspective we know that we're
 
04:16:41.450 --> 04:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
also looking at the impact of short-term
 
04:16:44.210 --> 04:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
rentals on the housing market we don't
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
know what the story is yet we're just
 
04:16:48.110 --> 04:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the data
 
04:16:50.929 --> 04:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
and finally the um our policy and
 
04:16:52.849 --> 04:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
Communications we do a lot of work with
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
Grassroots organizations helping them to
 
04:16:58.969 --> 04:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
communicate locally but we also
 
04:17:01.969 --> 04:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
um I will I will contradict what my
 
04:17:03.229 --> 04:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
friend Steve Lewis said this morning
 
04:17:05.530 --> 04:17:05.540 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire housing being
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
hamstrung uh and and being worried about
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
the funding well I said we don't get
 
04:17:12.050 --> 04:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
operational funding from the state and
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
we have been I would say active and
 
04:17:17.809 --> 04:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
aggressive with the legislature so 2008
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
we worked with the New Hampshire legal
 
04:17:21.290 --> 04:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
assistants to write the workforce
 
04:17:23.929 --> 04:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
housing law 2016 we worked with the home
 
04:17:25.490 --> 04:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
builders to write the accessory dwelling
 
04:17:29.150 --> 04:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
unit law 2019 we wrote the housing
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
appeals board legislation for Senator
 
04:17:34.969 --> 04:17:34.979 align:start position:0%
Bob Guida and this year we wrote the
 
04:17:37.130 --> 04:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
governor's request the legislation
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
introduced by Senator Dan Ennis the
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
historic housing tax credit which we'll
 
04:17:43.490 --> 04:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
have a hearing next Tuesday
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
in Senate committee so we're we're ready
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
to speak up but we're also ready to help
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
answer your questions thank you Mr Frost
 
04:17:53.689 --> 04:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
are there questions for Ben Frost
 
04:17:53.699 --> 04:17:55.250 align:start position:0%
are there questions for Ben Frost
representative

04:17:55.250 --> 04:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:56.450 --> 04:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:18:01.309 --> 04:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about the
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
um research that you're doing as far as
 
04:18:12.650 --> 04:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
um children per unit or per bedroom
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm interested if you are if you plan
 
04:18:20.570 --> 04:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
on breaking that data down by like
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
um you know let's say children per unit
 
04:18:28.849 --> 04:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
that or per per uh per unit that has one
 
04:18:30.889 --> 04:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
bedroom per unit that has two bedroom
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
per unit that like if you have a three
 
04:18:35.090 --> 04:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
bedroom house if you build a bunch of
 
04:18:36.290 --> 04:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
three bedroom houses you're gonna
 
04:18:37.849 --> 04:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
probably get more children than if you
 
04:18:41.450 --> 04:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
build a bunch of one bedroom unit houses
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
um if you will be showing that in in
 
04:18:46.849 --> 04:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
your data when you um are you breaking
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
it down by that yes representative that
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
is the plan beautiful
 
04:18:55.849 --> 04:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yes
 
04:18:57.720 --> 04:18:59.450 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yes
um

04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.210 --> 04:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
there is a discussion I guess earlier
 
04:19:08.330 --> 04:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
about the inspections and how often
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
they're happening and by all the
 
04:19:12.110 --> 04:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
different agencies
 
04:19:15.050 --> 04:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
um that might because maybe your your
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
agency may be only inspecting let's say
 
04:19:20.330 --> 04:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
every year or maybe even now every two
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
years but there may be other agencies
 
04:19:25.849 --> 04:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
um or funding sources or whatever that
 
04:19:28.250 --> 04:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
are inspecting also
 
04:19:32.090 --> 04:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
um and there was some hint of a
 
04:19:35.150 --> 04:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
discussion about is there a way or is it
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
is it feasible to possibly have let's
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
say your organization be uh your
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
inspection to also qualify for those
 
04:19:48.110 --> 04:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
other inspections and and and therefore
 
04:19:50.929 --> 04:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of inspections in
 
04:19:50.939 --> 04:19:52.250 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of inspections in
general

04:19:52.250 --> 04:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:19:53.929 --> 04:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
um maybe they would be accepted or maybe
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
we could offer like you know hey if
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're if you're interested we could
 
04:20:00.290 --> 04:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
save you money by by doing the
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
inspection and letting you know what we
 
04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
think kind of a thing um if
 
04:20:05.809 --> 04:20:05.819 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on that this is a
 
04:20:05.819 --> 04:20:06.710 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on that this is a
great

04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:20:10.370 --> 04:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
and it there's the I'll answer on a
 
04:20:11.929 --> 04:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
couple of different levels
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
um one is there
 
04:20:17.210 --> 04:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
different types of inspections so
 
04:20:19.309 --> 04:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
there's the construction inspection so
 
04:20:20.590 --> 04:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
while something is under construction
 
04:20:22.990 --> 04:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
and we we have
 
04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
created a model agreement that we are
 
04:20:30.170 --> 04:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
using now with different funders so that
 
04:20:32.150 --> 04:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
um you know so that the banks don't need
 
04:20:34.370 --> 04:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
to send their inspector uh and other
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
entities don't need to send their
 
04:20:37.370 --> 04:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
inspector we hire the inspector and they
 
04:20:39.650 --> 04:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
agree to accept the results of our
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
inspection so that limits the
 
04:20:44.150 --> 04:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
inspections during construction but the
 
04:20:45.769 --> 04:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
the subject that was at discussion this
 
04:20:47.990 --> 04:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
morning was it you know it's already
 
04:20:50.809 --> 04:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
occupied and and you get the
 
04:20:52.910 --> 04:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the the the Section 8
 
04:20:55.250 --> 04:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
housing Choice voucher inspection from
 
04:20:57.410 --> 04:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
looking at the quality of the the unit
 
04:21:00.490 --> 04:21:00.500 align:start position:0%
you get maybe an inspector looking at
 
04:21:03.530 --> 04:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
based on funding from the tax credit
 
04:21:06.889 --> 04:21:06.899 align:start position:0%
um so that does occur I would say in a
 
04:21:10.250 --> 04:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
in an ideal world yes
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
it and it's an outstanding idea the
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty of course is that we're
 
04:21:17.210 --> 04:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
dealing with multiple funding sources
 
04:21:19.250 --> 04:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:21:19.260 --> 04:21:19.969 align:start position:0%
that have
um

04:21:19.969 --> 04:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:23.769 --> 04:21:23.779 align:start position:0%
regulations that we must follow so
 
04:21:26.570 --> 04:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
mostly these this is a federal question
 
04:21:28.610 --> 04:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to I don't want to say
 
04:21:30.290 --> 04:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
oh it's the fact that we can do nothing
 
04:21:32.689 --> 04:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
about it uh because I think we can do
 
04:21:34.250 --> 04:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
something about it that's not something
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
that the legislature here really is in a
 
04:21:38.929 --> 04:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
position to do this is a federal
 
04:21:40.969 --> 04:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
question because most of these sources
 
04:21:44.809 --> 04:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
are federal in nature uh we do try to
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
minimize the inspection burden on the
 
04:21:50.330 --> 04:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
property owner the landlord and on the
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
tenant and yes I recognize the
 
04:21:55.010 --> 04:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
imposition that it poses on a tenant
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes though it's a it's a response
 
04:22:00.530 --> 04:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
to a tenant complaint so they're asking
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
us to come
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and and that we will do that at any
 
04:22:03.840 --> 04:22:05.809 align:start position:0%
um and and that we will do that at any
time

04:22:05.809 --> 04:22:05.819 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips I've remembered
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
my actual actual second question
 
04:22:11.040 --> 04:22:13.429 align:start position:0%
my actual actual second question
um

04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
that other one was on the Fly
 
04:22:18.530 --> 04:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
um because I forgot the the second one
 
04:22:20.570 --> 04:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
um there was a discussion earlier about
 
04:22:20.580 --> 04:22:21.950 align:start position:0%
um there was a discussion earlier about
how

04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:22:24.130 --> 04:22:24.140 align:start position:0%
um kind of the agency
 
04:22:27.309 --> 04:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
was previously
 
04:22:31.309 --> 04:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
offering Services I guess as far as
 
04:22:31.319 --> 04:22:32.809 align:start position:0%
offering Services I guess as far as
um

04:22:32.809 --> 04:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:34.849 --> 04:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
training or advising local
 
04:22:39.889 --> 04:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
municipalities or or or developers that
 
04:22:42.110 --> 04:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
see some problems going on at local
 
04:22:44.809 --> 04:22:44.819 align:start position:0%
municipalities about their application
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
of Law and how their sense was that the
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
that the agency wasn't doing that as
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
much anymore do you believe that that is
 
04:22:56.929 --> 04:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
the case that you are reduced that
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
amount or that you never really did it
 
04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
or that
 
04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
um that maybe that would be a good
 
04:23:06.530 --> 04:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
service that that would incentivize
 
04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities to
 
04:23:12.349 --> 04:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
kind of follow their the the spirit and
 
04:23:14.210 --> 04:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
the and the regulations that are in
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
place right now and maybe there isn't
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
any additional regulations necessary
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's just enforcement of the current
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
ones representative I do recall the
 
04:23:24.110 --> 04:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
question the the comment from Steve
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
Lewis who was uh talking about the
 
04:23:29.929 --> 04:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
um the former New Hampshire Housing
 
04:23:32.090 --> 04:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
Commission which existed in the 1970s
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
which is when he got his start as a home
 
04:23:36.650 --> 04:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
builder in Atkinson
 
04:23:38.929 --> 04:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that there was a
 
04:23:41.150 --> 04:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
certain level of activism at that time
 
04:23:45.290 --> 04:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
by the commission I will say we at New
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing we have from time to
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
time engaged in as interveners and
 
04:23:55.610 --> 04:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
litigations so in the um that the really
 
04:23:58.250 --> 04:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
important Britain versus Chester case it
 
04:23:59.210 --> 04:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
was decision of the New Hampshire
 
04:24:01.790 --> 04:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in 1991 the litigation
 
04:24:04.610 --> 04:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
began in 1986 we were interveners in
 
04:24:07.729 --> 04:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
that case on behalf of the builders and
 
04:24:09.969 --> 04:24:09.979 align:start position:0%
the would-be tenants
 
04:24:15.769 --> 04:24:15.779 align:start position:0%
and also we assisted with the litigation
 
04:24:17.809 --> 04:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
that great bridge properties took
 
04:24:19.610 --> 04:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
against the town of ossipy and I think
 
04:24:21.290 --> 04:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
you remember this
 
04:24:24.889 --> 04:24:24.899 align:start position:0%
um and so we we one of our employees was
 
04:24:28.610 --> 04:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
an expert witness in that case so and so
 
04:24:31.870 --> 04:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
we we do have some capacity to do that
 
04:24:34.010 --> 04:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
but really what what you're talking
 
04:24:36.530 --> 04:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
about is is not the litigation but
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
before you get to that point uh helping
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
with the municipal boards uh it's not
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
something we've done I don't know that
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that we've considered but
 
04:24:49.729 --> 04:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
it's something I I think is not a bad
 
04:24:53.689 --> 04:24:53.699 align:start position:0%
idea and I'll certainly take it back
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any other representative Walsh
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
yep thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and I hope you didn't and I apologize
 
04:25:04.130 --> 04:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
for leaving the room for a minute I had
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
to step out I hope you didn't answer my
 
04:25:07.729 --> 04:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
question while I was gone
 
04:25:07.739 --> 04:25:08.750 align:start position:0%
question while I was gone
um

04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:10.490 --> 04:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
I've asked this uh it's just for more
 
04:25:11.809 --> 04:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
data I've asked the question a couple
 
04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
different ways probably not that well uh
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
has there been you've obviously compiled
 
04:25:18.290 --> 04:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
a bunch of data here most of it's by
 
04:25:20.450 --> 04:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
county and I am looking and seeing that
 
04:25:22.550 --> 04:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
the problem is not as severe in every
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
County as it is in others so my question
 
04:25:26.929 --> 04:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
is because I know in Hooksett we are
 
04:25:29.389 --> 04:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
currently the planning board adopted or
 
04:25:29.399 --> 04:25:30.290 align:start position:0%
currently the planning board adopted or
uh

04:25:30.290 --> 04:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:32.210 --> 04:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
hired out we're doing our own housing
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
needs assessment
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
to assess what you need you have to know
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
what you have
 
04:25:40.490 --> 04:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
so has it gone down to the town level in
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
any of your studies on what is currently
 
04:25:45.170 --> 04:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
there for a mix of housing town by town
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't think every town needs
 
04:25:51.530 --> 04:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
the same solution as the others per se I
 
04:25:53.570 --> 04:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
agree this is a great question
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative the
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
um what I'll say is that we have not
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
done that however and you might be aware
 
04:26:03.349 --> 04:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
of this the state's nine Regional
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
planning commissions working with the
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
office of Planning and Development I
 
04:26:10.130 --> 04:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
have for the past year and a half two
 
04:26:12.530 --> 04:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
years been working on Regional Housing
 
04:26:15.649 --> 04:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
needs assessments which are looking at
 
04:26:19.070 --> 04:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
not just the regional need but figuring
 
04:26:23.110 --> 04:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
out what each individual municipalities
 
04:26:26.570 --> 04:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility is in meeting that need
 
04:26:29.210 --> 04:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
and so there's What's this called a fair
 
04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
share analysis and allocation so each
 
04:26:34.729 --> 04:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
municipality should be able to look to
 
04:26:36.410 --> 04:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
the Regional Housing needs assessment
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
and see okay this is what we've got to
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
do now the an individual municipality
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
might do its own analysis as Hooksett is
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
doing and come up with a different
 
04:26:48.889 --> 04:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
number probably because the depth of
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
your analysis will be that much greater
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
than what the regional Planning
 
04:26:55.010 --> 04:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
Commission is doing because no one knows
 
04:26:57.349 --> 04:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
your town as well as you do and you have
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
the capacity to look
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
more closely at what's going on than the
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
regional Planning Commission would or us
 
04:27:06.889 --> 04:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
or the office of Planning and
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
so at this point it's pretty much
 
04:27:14.210 --> 04:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
voluntarily town to town there is
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
nothing that's been done or
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
well there's no no compelling
 
04:27:22.250 --> 04:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
way to get this information well the the
 
04:27:25.010 --> 04:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
Regional Housing needs assessments are
 
04:27:27.530 --> 04:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
nearing completion so those those will
 
04:27:30.410 --> 04:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
be available very soon for all of the
 
04:27:32.570 --> 04:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
throughout the state each Regional
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission is doing its own
 
04:27:36.110 --> 04:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
analysis and have may have its own
 
04:27:38.210 --> 04:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
different timeline
 
04:27:38.220 --> 04:27:39.670 align:start position:0%
different timeline
um

04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
they are required to do this the
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions are
 
04:27:46.250 --> 04:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
required by law to do a Regional Housing
 
04:27:49.010 --> 04:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
needs assessment every five years that's
 
04:27:51.710 --> 04:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
part of their statutory mandate uh and
 
04:27:54.530 --> 04:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh so they they do that what's not
 
04:27:57.530 --> 04:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
required is that fair share analysis and
 
04:28:00.530 --> 04:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
allocation that's not in statute but is
 
04:28:02.809 --> 04:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
based on
 
04:28:05.450 --> 04:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
um in the Britain versus Chester lawsuit
 
04:28:08.330 --> 04:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
from the 90s and also on the workforce
 
04:28:10.610 --> 04:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
housing law which says that every
 
04:28:13.610 --> 04:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
municipality must provide its fair share
 
04:28:16.370 --> 04:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
of the Region's current and reasonably
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future need for Workforce
 
04:28:18.840 --> 04:28:19.670 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future need for Workforce
housing

04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and I believe they
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
are a month or so away you're right okay
 
04:28:24.649 --> 04:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
perfect so any other questions thank you
 
04:28:30.170 --> 04:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
Mr Boss appreciate it I'm sure you'll be
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
back I'd be happy to come back we are
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
nearing the end of work on our state
 
04:28:36.830 --> 04:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
white housing needs assessment and I'd
 
04:28:38.030 --> 04:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
love to come back and present the
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
results that would be great 200 Page
 
04:28:42.530 --> 04:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
study which I can condense
 
04:28:42.540 --> 04:28:44.750 align:start position:0%
study which I can condense
yes

04:28:44.750 --> 04:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:28:49.370 --> 04:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'm gonna take maybe a
 
04:28:53.389 --> 04:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
five minute break and let our next
 
04:28:53.399 --> 04:28:54.469 align:start position:0%
five minute break and let our next
witness

04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
witness
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
um set up
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
um his computer and things so with that
 
04:28:59.450 --> 04:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll get back together around 2
 
04:29:30.170 --> 04:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.180 --> 04:38:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
00

04:38:52.510 --> 04:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.010 --> 04:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
okay so we are back House special
 
04:38:56.929 --> 04:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
committee on housing
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
um so I would like to invite or or
 
04:39:03.051 --> 04:39:03.061 align:start position:0%
um introduce my friend Jason sorens I
 
04:39:05.631 --> 04:39:05.641 align:start position:0%
initially met him a few years ago at St
 
04:39:07.730 --> 04:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
ansem College event he was uh at the
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
time working for St Andrew College
 
04:39:10.849 --> 04:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
college of Ethics business and
 
04:39:10.859 --> 04:39:11.929 align:start position:0%
college of Ethics business and
governance

04:39:11.929 --> 04:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
governance
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
um which is a great organization aims at
 
04:39:15.230 --> 04:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
getting people
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
um like moral like building a better
 
04:39:19.010 --> 04:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
moral foundation for the state through
 
04:39:21.170 --> 04:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
Ethics in governance
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
um so since then he's moved on so he's
 
04:39:25.010 --> 04:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
now senior research Factory at American
 
04:39:27.650 --> 04:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
Institute for economic research but
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
um Jason's been doing quite a bit of
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
research on New Hampshire zoning so as
 
04:39:33.890 --> 04:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
soon as we thought zoning we brought it
 
04:39:35.449 --> 04:39:35.459 align:start position:0%
up in the first meeting I instantly knew
 
04:39:35.459 --> 04:39:36.470 align:start position:0%
up in the first meeting I instantly knew
that

04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you would have something to
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
contribute so you'd recently came out
 
04:39:42.050 --> 04:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
with some research and um so I would
 
04:39:44.090 --> 04:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
like you to at least present and let us
 
04:39:46.490 --> 04:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
let us learn more great thank you Mr
 
04:39:48.890 --> 04:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Representatives
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
um I was told to allocate an hour but my
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
presentation is only about 30 minutes so
 
04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
there should be plenty of time for
 
04:39:54.480 --> 04:39:55.490 align:start position:0%
there should be plenty of time for
questions

04:39:55.490 --> 04:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:39:57.170 --> 04:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
um so I am talking about New Hampshire
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
zoning laws and uh their effect
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
especially on the housing market today
 
04:40:04.850 --> 04:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
so a little bit about the nature of
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
zoning in New Hampshire
 
04:40:09.288 --> 04:40:09.298 align:start position:0%
um RSA 674 is really the core
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislative grant of authority the
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
so-called zoning enabling act for
 
04:40:13.920 --> 04:40:15.890 align:start position:0%
so-called zoning enabling act for
municipalities

04:40:15.890 --> 04:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:40:18.650 --> 04:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
um and uh and neighboring chapters sort
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
of Flesh that out
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
so when you think about zoning there's
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
really zoning strictly defined which has
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
to do with separating uses and and
 
04:40:33.530 --> 04:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
limiting density but then you also have
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
other land use planning powers that
 
04:40:38.090 --> 04:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities have subdivision
 
04:40:40.910 --> 04:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
regulations site plan regulations and
 
04:40:43.310 --> 04:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
building codes and those are all based
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
in this chapter of statutes
 
04:40:48.970 --> 04:40:48.980 align:start position:0%
um over time
 
04:40:52.430 --> 04:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
the the state's regulation and and
 
04:40:54.530 --> 04:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
grants of power to municipalities have
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
become more complex and detailed uh so
 
04:40:58.788 --> 04:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
for instance Innovative land use
 
04:41:01.250 --> 04:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
controls is a long list of
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
um so-called Innovative zoning
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
authorities that uh municipalities can
 
04:41:08.930 --> 04:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
off uh Implement and authorize and the
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
state has given them the power to do
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
that historic Heritage Agriculture and
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
housing commissions are all things have
 
04:41:16.128 --> 04:41:16.138 align:start position:0%
been added over time
 
04:41:19.730 --> 04:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at the statutes there are
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
a few ways in which the state explicitly
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
constrains what United municipalities
 
04:41:26.330 --> 04:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
can do with zoning especially related to
 
04:41:29.570 --> 04:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
housing so for instance inclusionary
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
zoning is authorized as an as an
 
04:41:34.730 --> 04:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
Innovative land use control inclusionary
 
04:41:34.740 --> 04:41:35.830 align:start position:0%
Innovative land use control inclusionary
zoning

04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
04:41:41.110 --> 04:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
is a a tool that provides an incentive
 
04:41:45.170 --> 04:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
to a builder developer to maintain
 
04:41:47.570 --> 04:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
guaranteed affordability for some of the
 
04:41:49.368 --> 04:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
units and it usually has some sort of
 
04:41:52.128 --> 04:41:52.138 align:start position:0%
income test so some of the units have to
 
04:41:55.448 --> 04:41:55.458 align:start position:0%
be rented or sold at below Market rates
 
04:41:55.458 --> 04:41:57.368 align:start position:0%
be rented or sold at below Market rates
to

04:41:57.368 --> 04:41:57.378 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
renters or buyers who have incomes below
 
04:42:02.448 --> 04:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
a certain level
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
however the state requires this only be
 
04:42:06.650 --> 04:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
implemented as a voluntary incentive
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
some other states like California have
 
04:42:10.810 --> 04:42:10.820 align:start position:0%
mandatory inclusionary zoning where a
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
town can simply say if you want to build
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
anything it has to include these
 
04:42:18.530 --> 04:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
price-controlled units
 
04:42:21.410 --> 04:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
a second way that the state preempts
 
04:42:24.288 --> 04:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
local zoning manufactured housing has to
 
04:42:26.208 --> 04:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
be allowed in most of the land area
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
zoned for residential according to the
 
04:42:30.770 --> 04:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
language of the statute so that is a way
 
04:42:33.410 --> 04:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
in which New Hampshire constrains uh
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
local zoning Authority probably more
 
04:42:37.730 --> 04:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
strongly than other New England states
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
the workforce housing law that that Ben
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
Frost mentioned for instance I'm sure
 
04:42:43.128 --> 04:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
other speakers today have mentioned that
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
every municipality must allow reasonable
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
and realistic opportunities for the
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
development of Workforce housing on a
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
majority of residentially zoned land
 
04:42:52.850 --> 04:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean multi-family housing
 
04:42:55.128 --> 04:42:55.138 align:start position:0%
has to be allowed on a majority of
 
04:42:56.810 --> 04:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
residentially zoned land but there has
 
04:42:59.208 --> 04:42:59.218 align:start position:0%
to be the capability reasonable and
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
realistic opportunities to develop some
 
04:43:02.810 --> 04:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
kind of Workforce housing whether it's
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
single-family owner occupied Workforce
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
housing or multi-family there is a
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
common misconception that Workforce
 
04:43:13.610 --> 04:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
housing is this inclusionary housing
 
04:43:15.170 --> 04:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily the case
 
04:43:17.448 --> 04:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
according to statute it simply has to be
 
04:43:20.090 --> 04:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
affordable and that's defined in statute
 
04:43:21.708 --> 04:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
but that could be naturally affordable
 
04:43:23.570 --> 04:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
it could be sold at a market rate that
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
is nevertheless affordable
 
04:43:28.010 --> 04:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
and and count as Workforce housing
 
04:43:30.110 --> 04:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units or accessory
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
apartments or in-law apartments
 
04:43:36.128 --> 04:43:36.138 align:start position:0%
um must be allowed by municipalities and
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
places where detached single-family
 
04:43:42.170 --> 04:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
homes are allowed but municipalities May
 
04:43:46.208 --> 04:43:46.218 align:start position:0%
Place certain restrictions on them
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
nationally there are other states that
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
have that have also implemented a law
 
04:43:52.990 --> 04:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
like this California recently
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire's is one of the the
 
04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
furthest reaching in terms of
 
04:43:59.448 --> 04:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
restricting ways in which municipalities
 
04:44:04.010 --> 04:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:06.770 --> 04:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
so what are the characteristics of local
 
04:44:08.090 --> 04:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
ordinances in New Hampshire are there
 
04:44:11.150 --> 04:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
any ways we can sort of generalize well
 
04:44:14.090 --> 04:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
the usual purposes of zoning regulations
 
04:44:16.010 --> 04:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
not just in New Hampshire but throughout
 
04:44:18.170 --> 04:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
the United States are first of all
 
04:44:20.868 --> 04:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
separating uses and limiting density and
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
so zoning zoning ordinances are paired
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
with zoning Maps the zoning map will
 
04:44:28.490 --> 04:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
show different districts and those
 
04:44:31.010 --> 04:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
districts are intended for different
 
04:44:33.530 --> 04:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
uses so commercial use is allowed over
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
here residential uses a lot over there
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
industrial uses over there
 
04:44:41.690 --> 04:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
and in some cases you could allow
 
04:44:44.270 --> 04:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
multiple uses in a district and and some
 
04:44:46.250 --> 04:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities do that but this is sort
 
04:44:49.490 --> 04:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
of the classic rationale for zoning is
 
04:44:52.128 --> 04:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
to separate uses that are thought to be
 
04:44:56.090 --> 04:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
incompatible but the second purpose of
 
04:44:59.090 --> 04:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
zoning is is a very very common one and
 
04:45:00.650 --> 04:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty much ubiquitous and that
 
04:45:03.170 --> 04:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
is to limit density to either require
 
04:45:05.890 --> 04:45:05.900 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size sizes or just a direct
 
04:45:08.690 --> 04:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
maximum number of units allowed in a
 
04:45:11.830 --> 04:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
particular unit of land like an acre
 
04:45:15.288 --> 04:45:15.298 align:start position:0%
that is a very common feature of zoning
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances in our state and in other
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
states as well
 
04:45:23.810 --> 04:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
19 municipalities a little under 10 lack
 
04:45:26.448 --> 04:45:26.458 align:start position:0%
zoning all of these are rural uh they're
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
they're up north
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
um for the most part I think lemster is
 
04:45:32.990 --> 04:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
the furthest uh South one in some of
 
04:45:34.490 --> 04:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
them subdivision regulations still
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
function to limit density so some of
 
04:45:37.850 --> 04:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
them actually set minimum lot sizes in
 
04:45:39.770 --> 04:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
their subdivision regulations so they're
 
04:45:41.930 --> 04:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
effectively still doing a zoning type
 
04:45:44.090 --> 04:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
function and then there are 14 other
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities that technically have
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
zoning but the entire town is a single
 
04:45:49.368 --> 04:45:49.378 align:start position:0%
District so they're not really doing the
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
separation of uses function and so it's
 
04:45:54.050 --> 04:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
not very clear how a town that
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
supposedly lacks zoning but nevertheless
 
04:45:58.850 --> 04:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
restricts density in some other way is
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
it really any different from a town that
 
04:46:02.690 --> 04:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
restricts density town wide but doesn't
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:07.490 --> 04:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
um typical features of New Hampshire
 
04:46:09.650 --> 04:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
zoning ways in which New Hampshire
 
04:46:12.170 --> 04:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
zoning is a little bit different maybe
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the U.S or at least
 
04:46:17.330 --> 04:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
certain parts of the rest of the US most
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
residential land area is reserved for
 
04:46:21.890 --> 04:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
single family only detached single
 
04:46:21.900 --> 04:46:23.150 align:start position:0%
single family only detached single
family

04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
um now that is that is quite common in
 
04:46:28.190 --> 04:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
other places as well but um it's
 
04:46:30.110 --> 04:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
probably stronger here because we're a
 
04:46:31.970 --> 04:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
more rural State than a lot of other
 
04:46:31.980 --> 04:46:34.250 align:start position:0%
more rural State than a lot of other
states

04:46:34.250 --> 04:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
um we frequently see in New Hampshire
 
04:46:39.170 --> 04:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
that small scale commercial operations
 
04:46:41.330 --> 04:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
let's say Corner groceries and things
 
04:46:43.550 --> 04:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
like that are allowed in in residential
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
districts not certainly not always
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
um but in about half of the residential
 
04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
land area you'll see at least some
 
04:46:50.750 --> 04:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
general category of commercial use
 
04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
allowed which is and it's often rural
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
areas which is a little bit different
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
from some other places and my hypothesis
 
04:47:01.490 --> 04:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
for this is that towns want the tax
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
revenue that commercial development
 
04:47:04.550 --> 04:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
brings and so there's a direct incentive
 
04:47:07.970 --> 04:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
for them to allow commercial development
 
04:47:10.730 --> 04:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
um a feature of of New England zoning uh
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
that just everyone in this field knows
 
04:47:14.930 --> 04:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
about it's the land of high minimum lot
 
04:47:17.090 --> 04:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
sizes so minimum minimum lot size is
 
04:47:17.100 --> 04:47:18.948 align:start position:0%
sizes so minimum minimum lot size is
constraining

04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
constraining
 
04:47:21.170 --> 04:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
um a house to be built on a large piece
 
04:47:24.288 --> 04:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
of land and that's very typical in New
 
04:47:26.090 --> 04:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in other New England
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
states but is rarer in in the rest of
 
04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
the country
 
04:47:31.550 --> 04:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire one of the interesting
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
things I think is maybe even a little
 
04:47:34.250 --> 04:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
bit different from some of the other New
 
04:47:36.410 --> 04:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
England states is that uh seminist
 
04:47:37.610 --> 04:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
values will actually just regulate
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
minimum Road Frontage and that's the way
 
04:47:41.690 --> 04:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
they limit density it's not the lot size
 
04:47:44.208 --> 04:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
but it's the frontage
 
04:47:46.910 --> 04:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
so how tight is New Hampshire zoning if
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
we compare it to other states this is a
 
04:47:51.530 --> 04:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
really difficult exercise I'm going to
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
give you a couple of different sources
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
here and they give somewhat different
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
results one is this Wharton residential
 
04:48:00.050 --> 04:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
land use regulatory index that's
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
produced by some UPenn economists and
 
04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
what they do is they survey thousands of
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
Municipal officials around the country
 
04:48:11.090 --> 04:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
on a number of different things and some
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
of them are a little bit subjective like
 
04:48:16.250 --> 04:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
how active are Town residents in showing
 
04:48:18.170 --> 04:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
up to public hearings on new
 
04:48:20.330 --> 04:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
developments and that that sort of thing
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
and they use the answers to those
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions to come up with a single index
 
04:48:27.170 --> 04:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
of how restrictive zoning is
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
because it's a survey I think for
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
smaller States like New Hampshire it can
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
be kind of volatile and and we see this
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
in uh in the two ways of the survey that
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
they've done one was in 2005 and one was
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
in 2018. in 2005 New Hampshire looked
 
04:48:45.890 --> 04:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
like the fourth most strict strictly
 
04:48:48.530 --> 04:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
zoned state in the country after Hawaii
 
04:48:50.170 --> 04:48:50.180 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and Massachusetts
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of face validity
 
04:48:53.930 --> 04:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
there everyone knows Hawaii is very
 
04:48:56.090 --> 04:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
strict land use regulations and other
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
New England states as well
 
04:49:01.850 --> 04:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
um not to mention New Jersey then in the
 
04:49:04.850 --> 04:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
2018 survey New Hampshire looks 31st so
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire actually looks like it's
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
just a just an average state in terms of
 
04:49:10.250 --> 04:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
how strict zoning is
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
um did New Hampshire actually reduce
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
zoning that much in those 13 years I
 
04:49:15.948 --> 04:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
mean we did get some Statewide
 
04:49:17.330 --> 04:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
legislation that's been talked about
 
04:49:20.208 --> 04:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing law and the Adu law I
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
um that New Hampshire really dropped
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
that much but but there's probably some
 
04:49:28.190 --> 04:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
volatility here because it's a small
 
04:49:29.570 --> 04:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
state and when you're doing a survey
 
04:49:31.128 --> 04:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
just the sample size is going to be
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
small for a small state
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
but you do see some again face validity
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
here in 2018 with New Jersey Maryland
 
04:49:39.470 --> 04:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island California everyone knows
 
04:49:42.350 --> 04:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
has very strict land use regulation all
 
04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
showing up near the top here's another
 
04:49:47.330 --> 04:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
source that's been used by economists a
 
04:49:49.788 --> 04:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
couple of Harvard economists ganong and
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
shog have this this piece looking at
 
04:49:56.570 --> 04:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
land use regulation and its effects on
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
the economy that's been widely cited
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
their measure of land use regulation is
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
State appellate decisions containing the
 
04:50:06.530 --> 04:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
phrase land use cumulative from January
 
04:50:08.448 --> 04:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
1st 1920 which is about when zoning
 
04:50:11.410 --> 04:50:11.420 align:start position:0%
started divided by state population
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
so the idea here is that if you regulate
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
land use more strictly you're going to
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
get more land use conflicts and and uh
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
and more court cases and here New
 
04:50:20.750 --> 04:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire looks like the fifth strictest
 
04:50:23.208 --> 04:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
state in the country
 
04:50:25.970 --> 04:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
let's look at regulatory restrictions
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
across the territory of our state this
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
is forthcoming data that is not yet
 
04:50:32.270 --> 04:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
available to the public from the New
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire zoning Atlas this will be
 
04:50:35.448 --> 04:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
released from the center for ethics and
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
Society uh next month
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and I was the the pi on that uh on
 
04:50:43.550 --> 04:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
This research project
 
04:50:48.410 --> 04:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
but we worked in hand in hand with OPD
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire housing as well in uh
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
in in putting these data together and
 
04:50:55.730 --> 04:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
raising funding for it so
 
04:51:00.170 --> 04:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
um here are a few preview maps of of
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
what the um the zoning looks like in
 
04:51:05.690 --> 04:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
these categories so we're going to look
 
04:51:08.628 --> 04:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
at and how much of our land area is
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
single-family housing allowed on a small
 
04:51:13.730 --> 04:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
lot that is under an acre and how much
 
04:51:16.850 --> 04:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
of the state is a duplex allowed on a
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
small lot under an acre on how much in
 
04:51:21.410 --> 04:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
how much of the state is a five family
 
04:51:24.530 --> 04:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
structure allowed on a on a small lot
 
04:51:26.448 --> 04:51:26.458 align:start position:0%
and here a small lot is defined as two
 
04:51:28.850 --> 04:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
and a half acres so that's meeting that
 
04:51:32.270 --> 04:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
same density of of two units per acre
 
04:51:34.850 --> 04:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
um and then uh where a large adus
 
04:51:36.890 --> 04:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
allowed you know larger than the state
 
04:51:39.410 --> 04:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
requires and whereas manufactured
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
housing allowed
 
04:51:43.010 --> 04:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to show you first single
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
family and duplexes on small Lots you
 
04:51:48.170 --> 04:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
see on the on the left hand side here uh
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of the state does
 
04:51:53.050 --> 04:51:53.060 align:start position:0%
not allow single family on small Lots
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
now in some cases you might say that
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
that this is the result of lacking
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
Wastewater infrastructure on the State
 
04:52:03.288 --> 04:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
does regulate minimum lot size for
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
septic but most of those requirements
 
04:52:10.690 --> 04:52:10.700 align:start position:0%
unless your soils are really bad or your
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
slopes are steep you can get septic on
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
less than an acre lot so in general most
 
04:52:19.970 --> 04:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
towns are are requiring minimum lot
 
04:52:22.190 --> 04:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
sizes for even for detached single
 
04:52:24.830 --> 04:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
family that are higher than is strictly
 
04:52:29.330 --> 04:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
necessary for a septic system
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
um and in fact the number here is 13 of
 
04:52:35.448 --> 04:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
the buildable land area of the state is
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
available for small lot single family
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
and so you can see in Gray here these
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
are non-buildable areas White Mountain
 
04:52:45.128 --> 04:52:45.138 align:start position:0%
National Forest interstate highways
 
04:52:51.610 --> 04:52:51.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah so that's one uh under one acre
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size and under 200 feet of
 
04:53:01.970 --> 04:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
minimum Road Frontage
 
04:53:04.610 --> 04:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
that's right and so then for for small
 
04:53:07.010 --> 04:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
duplex here we're saying uh we're
 
04:53:09.890 --> 04:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
counting as a small uh small lot duplex
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
under an acre minimum lot size
 
04:53:17.090 --> 04:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
um or more than uh and more than uh two
 
04:53:20.830 --> 04:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
units per acre uh allowed
 
04:53:25.128 --> 04:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
for for duplexes so uh so that uh some
 
04:53:27.288 --> 04:53:27.298 align:start position:0%
some towns will will specify a maximum
 
04:53:30.110 --> 04:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
density some will not and just specify
 
04:53:31.610 --> 04:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
the minimum lot size so we wanted to
 
04:53:33.708 --> 04:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
have both those criteria in there and
 
04:53:35.810 --> 04:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
you can see that less of the state is
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
available for small lot duplexes
 
04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and the figure here I believe is
 
04:53:43.128 --> 04:53:43.138 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent of the buildable land
 
04:53:45.890 --> 04:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
area is available for duplexes on small
 
04:53:45.900 --> 04:53:47.330 align:start position:0%
area is available for duplexes on small
Lots

04:53:47.330 --> 04:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
Lots
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay and now let's look at five families
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
so five family you see actually
 
04:53:54.530 --> 04:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
um more of the land areas available for
 
04:53:57.410 --> 04:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
five family than for duplexes uh at
 
04:53:59.930 --> 04:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
higher densities and that may be a
 
04:54:01.970 --> 04:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
little bit surprising but I wonder if
 
04:54:03.530 --> 04:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
this has something to do with the State
 
04:54:06.190 --> 04:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing law again it requires
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
a reasonable and realistic opportunities
 
04:54:11.090 --> 04:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
for Workforce housing multi-family
 
04:54:13.010 --> 04:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
housing in that statute is defined as
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
five units or more in a structure so it
 
04:54:17.090 --> 04:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
could be that some towns in order to
 
04:54:18.170 --> 04:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're meeting the
 
04:54:21.430 --> 04:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements allow for
 
04:54:24.890 --> 04:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
five units on a fairly small small lot
 
04:54:26.650 --> 04:54:26.660 align:start position:0%
but again it does tend to be
 
04:54:30.288 --> 04:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
interestingly the more rural areas that
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
are allowing apartment buildings which
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
is where you wouldn't really expect a
 
04:54:38.510 --> 04:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
lot of the demand to be you know
 
04:54:40.610 --> 04:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh New Hampshire and Clarksville
 
04:54:42.890 --> 04:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
up there at the very top
 
04:54:44.750 --> 04:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
um you know that's these are not places
 
04:54:47.510 --> 04:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
where developers are are clamoring to
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
build residential Towers right and
 
04:54:53.230 --> 04:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
that's it's just not a feasible or or
 
04:54:55.070 --> 04:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
market-driven form of development out
 
04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
there so in in terms of places where
 
04:54:59.330 --> 04:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
there is that demand and more the
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
Southeastern part of the state you see
 
04:55:03.650 --> 04:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
that it's still a a small share of the
 
04:55:05.810 --> 04:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
land area that's available uh for this
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
again on small Lots right so a lot of
 
04:55:11.208 --> 04:55:11.218 align:start position:0%
towns will allow five family on let's
 
04:55:14.330 --> 04:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
say a 10 acre lot or larger but that's
 
04:55:16.910 --> 04:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
not necessarily an economically
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
attractive uh proposition for a lot of
 
04:55:19.200 --> 04:55:21.350 align:start position:0%
attractive uh proposition for a lot of
landowners

04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
landowners
 
04:55:24.170 --> 04:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see that a large majority of the
 
04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
of the land area is available for large
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
adus and this varies mostly by town and
 
04:55:31.250 --> 04:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
not by zoning District unlike the the
 
04:55:34.250 --> 04:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
previous maps and the reason for this is
 
04:55:37.128 --> 04:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
presumably again the state law that that
 
04:55:39.730 --> 04:55:39.740 align:start position:0%
says wherever you allow single family
 
04:55:43.250 --> 04:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
you also have to allow for adus and so
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
typically towns do not say you can have
 
04:55:47.448 --> 04:55:47.458 align:start position:0%
this size Adu in this single family
 
04:55:49.730 --> 04:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
district and this size Adu in a
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
different single-family District they
 
04:55:53.330 --> 04:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
just have a single ordinance that covers
 
04:55:55.368 --> 04:55:55.378 align:start position:0%
the entire land area and then finally
 
04:55:56.990 --> 04:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing you see that the
 
04:55:59.208 --> 04:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the buildable land area
 
04:56:01.250 --> 04:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
of the state is available for
 
04:56:03.170 --> 04:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and again probably
 
04:56:05.090 --> 04:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
because of State Statute that that
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
requires this on the majority of each
 
04:56:09.650 --> 04:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
Town's land area you will see some towns
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
here that seemingly do not
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
um conform to state law
 
04:56:18.350 --> 04:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it there they may have
 
04:56:19.850 --> 04:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
some explanation for that but this is
 
04:56:21.650 --> 04:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
according to our measure we're not
 
04:56:23.208 --> 04:56:23.218 align:start position:0%
seeing that they allow that on the
 
04:56:27.170 --> 04:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay so uh once this is released and
 
04:56:32.690 --> 04:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
you'll be hearing more about it in the
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
coming weeks this will be available at
 
04:56:36.350 --> 04:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
this website
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire zoning Atlas and
 
04:56:40.550 --> 04:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
there'll be many more findings so this
 
04:56:43.550 --> 04:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
is just a short little teaser
 
04:56:45.470 --> 04:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a little bit more
 
04:56:48.170 --> 04:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
information now about the origins and
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
effects of of zoning in New Hampshire
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
um so zoning was authorized by Statute
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
in 1926 around the time many other
 
04:57:00.590 --> 04:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
states did it and some towns adopted it
 
04:57:02.090 --> 04:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
almost immediately Keen Portsmouth
 
04:57:04.368 --> 04:57:04.378 align:start position:0%
Manchester Concord Nashua fairly early
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
on more urban jurisdictions but also it
 
04:57:08.690 --> 04:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
looks like some of the wealthier
 
04:57:10.190 --> 04:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the state that are
 
04:57:12.830 --> 04:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
certainly not very Urban in the 1930s
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
like Hanover and Durham uh also adopted
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
zoning very early on
 
04:57:20.810 --> 04:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
and then we see another wave of zoning
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
adoption in the 1960s and 1970s periods
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
of very high growth in this state and
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's when a lot of the more Rural and
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
Suburban communities began to adopt
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
zoning explicitly as a way of
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
controlling growth and limiting how fast
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I've done some research for the
 
04:57:42.170 --> 04:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
Josiah Bartlett Center that constructs a
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
measure of regulatory stringency by town
 
04:57:47.208 --> 04:57:47.218 align:start position:0%
and that correlates positively with how
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
long zoning has been in place in other
 
04:57:51.850 --> 04:57:51.860 align:start position:0%
words the longer zoning has been around
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
the stricter it tends to be
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
if you compare towns and there's a
 
04:57:59.390 --> 04:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
little scatter plot here that shows that
 
04:58:01.610 --> 04:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
relationship and you see just a handful
 
04:58:04.128 --> 04:58:04.138 align:start position:0%
of towns adopt zoning early on
 
04:58:07.310 --> 04:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
and then a bunch start uh adopting it in
 
04:58:09.890 --> 04:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
the 60s and 70s and those are more
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
restrictive today apparently than uh
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
than those that adopted it in the 80s
 
04:58:18.530 --> 04:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
90s and that's pretty much when the when
 
04:58:20.570 --> 04:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
the zoning adoption stops Dalton tried
 
04:58:22.368 --> 04:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
to do it and then it was voted down
 
04:58:22.378 --> 04:58:24.470 align:start position:0%
to do it and then it was voted down
again

04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:58:28.010 --> 04:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
um so uh what does this tell us it may
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
mean that some of the communities that
 
04:58:31.970 --> 04:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
adopted zoning
 
04:58:34.430 --> 04:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
um starting in the 50s 60s and 70s were
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
doing it again explicitly to try to
 
04:58:42.350 --> 04:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:44.330 --> 04:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to just give you a very
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
little bit about how I constructed this
 
04:58:47.690 --> 04:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
measure of regulatory stringency and
 
04:58:50.330 --> 04:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
what it looks like for jurisdictions in
 
04:58:53.448 --> 04:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so what I did is I looked
 
04:58:55.850 --> 04:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
at quality adjusted cost of housing by
 
04:58:57.530 --> 04:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
year I have a data set of all
 
04:58:59.208 --> 04:58:59.218 align:start position:0%
single-family home sales in the state
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
since 1997 something like 145 000 of
 
04:59:06.788 --> 04:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
them and I look at how much do they cost
 
04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
compared to what you'd expect given
 
04:59:11.570 --> 04:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
features of the housing like how old it
 
04:59:13.550 --> 04:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
is how many square footage how big the
 
04:59:15.708 --> 04:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
lot size how many bedrooms how many
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and so on
 
04:59:20.690 --> 04:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
um and then I average that by town like
 
04:59:23.448 --> 04:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
how much does that housing cost more
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
than you would expect given uh its
 
04:59:26.160 --> 04:59:27.170 align:start position:0%
than you would expect given uh its
features

04:59:27.170 --> 04:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
features
 
04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
and then I I look at
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
um population growth
 
04:59:34.610 --> 04:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
all right and so population growth this
 
04:59:37.490 --> 04:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
is coming out of our state's estimates
 
04:59:41.448 --> 04:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
and it's based on the OPD data that um
 
04:59:43.850 --> 04:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
that Ben Frost mentioned on on dwelling
 
04:59:45.708 --> 04:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
units permitted
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
and so well the idea here is is that if
 
04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
some towns are more costly than others
 
04:59:57.890 --> 04:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
simply because of demand people want to
 
05:00:00.050 --> 05:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
live there and they build up the cost of
 
05:00:00.060 --> 05:00:01.368 align:start position:0%
live there and they build up the cost of
housing

05:00:01.368 --> 05:00:01.378 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:00:03.650 --> 05:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
then we would probably expect those also
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
to do fast growing jurisdictions people
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
want to live there but they just can't
 
05:00:09.410 --> 05:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
build new homes fast enough and so the
 
05:00:11.690 --> 05:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
cost goes up but they're still growing
 
05:00:13.128 --> 05:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
faster than places where people don't
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
want to live
 
05:00:17.868 --> 05:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
but if restricted Supply is driving
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
costs then we shouldn't see that
 
05:00:21.530 --> 05:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
relationship we should see costly towns
 
05:00:23.690 --> 05:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
that are growing slowly because they've
 
05:00:25.970 --> 05:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
restricted Supply people want to live
 
05:00:27.890 --> 05:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
there but they can't because homes
 
05:00:29.930 --> 05:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
aren't being built
 
05:00:33.410 --> 05:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
and my result is that if I look at towns
 
05:00:35.930 --> 05:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
that don't have zoning it is positive so
 
05:00:38.570 --> 05:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
in towns that don't have zoning
 
05:00:38.580 --> 05:00:39.230 align:start position:0%
in towns that don't have zoning
um

05:00:39.230 --> 05:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
demand is what drives the cost of
 
05:00:43.250 --> 05:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
housing but everywhere else it seems
 
05:00:45.050 --> 05:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
like it's restricted Supply that's
 
05:00:47.390 --> 05:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
driving the cost of housing and so the
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that Supply restrictions
 
05:00:50.930 --> 05:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
in the face of rising demand as
 
05:00:53.448 --> 05:00:53.458 align:start position:0%
population grows are a big driver of
 
05:00:55.490 --> 05:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
housing costs this might be a little bit
 
05:00:59.868 --> 05:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
hard to uh to see but uh this is a cloud
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
of all towns on their population growth
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
on the x-axis and their excess price how
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
much how much more costly than average
 
05:01:09.170 --> 05:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
they are probably not surprising that
 
05:01:11.090 --> 05:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
Newcastle rye and Portsmouth and
 
05:01:13.730 --> 05:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
Newington are extremely expensive towns
 
05:01:16.010 --> 05:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
in the state but what's especially
 
05:01:17.810 --> 05:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
interesting is that these towns are not
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
growing fast
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
and see these are towns that are growing
 
05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
about the average for New Hampshire
 
05:01:25.730 --> 05:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
whereas towns like Lincoln
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know those of us who like to go
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
to Loon uh you know it's a popular place
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
right so but it's that um that cost
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
growth is being driven by population
 
05:01:37.610 --> 05:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
growth and then whereas like Stratford
 
05:01:40.490 --> 05:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
and Clarks feel and places like that
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
um they're very cheap but people don't
 
05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
want to live there there are no jobs
 
05:01:44.930 --> 05:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
there so they're not they're not bidding
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
up the cost of housing there so
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
um the higher cost you are more than we
 
05:01:51.230 --> 05:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
would expect given your population
 
05:01:55.070 --> 05:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
growth that's my measure of how
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
restricted your supply is
 
05:01:57.600 --> 05:01:58.730 align:start position:0%
restricted your supply is
okay

05:01:58.730 --> 05:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit of technical detail there
 
05:02:04.010 --> 05:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
but I think the results have some face
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
validity here so this is a map of a
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
restrictiveness of housing Supply by
 
05:02:13.970 --> 05:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
municipality and we see that in the
 
05:02:15.650 --> 05:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
Southeast housing Supply is more
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
restricted right darker colors are more
 
05:02:19.550 --> 05:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
restricted we see some in The Lakes
 
05:02:21.650 --> 05:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
region in in the Upper Valley and maybe
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit in the White Mountains are
 
05:02:25.490 --> 05:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
a little bit restrictive and then sort
 
05:02:27.650 --> 05:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
of the Appalachian spine up from
 
05:02:29.650 --> 05:02:29.660 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county all the way up to koas
 
05:02:32.628 --> 05:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
that's where Supply is not restricted
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
very much compared to the rest of the
 
05:02:34.138 --> 05:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
very much compared to the rest of the
state

05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:02:37.610 --> 05:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
and this isn't terribly surprising
 
05:02:40.190 --> 05:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
because you would expect that the places
 
05:02:41.690 --> 05:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
where people want to live that are under
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
having the population growth those are
 
05:02:45.288 --> 05:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
precisely the places that are more
 
05:02:47.810 --> 05:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
likely to adopt ordinance to manage that
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
growth and so that's going to be the
 
05:02:50.690 --> 05:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
southern southern part of the state and
 
05:02:52.490 --> 05:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
places where there are lots of amenities
 
05:02:55.010 --> 05:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
like the Lakes region in the mountains
 
05:02:56.810 --> 05:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
um so one of the effects of regulatory
 
05:02:58.430 --> 05:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
stringency so I did some statistical
 
05:03:00.770 --> 05:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
tests here to to look at this and and
 
05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
there's there's a large economics
 
05:03:04.128 --> 05:03:04.138 align:start position:0%
literature on this this is by no means
 
05:03:06.410 --> 05:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
the first person to look at this but I I
 
05:03:09.530 --> 05:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
am drilling down on on the case in in
 
05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:03:13.128 --> 05:03:13.138 align:start position:0%
so what we see is that with population
 
05:03:16.010 --> 05:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
growth over time it is slowed so in the
 
05:03:19.368 --> 05:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
70s and the 80s we grew rapidly so 25
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
growth in the 70s 20 growth in the 80s
 
05:03:27.708 --> 05:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
then down to 11 in the 90s 6.5 the 2000s
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
and then 4.6 population growth in the
 
05:03:33.050 --> 05:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
2010s now what do we think is happening
 
05:03:34.610 --> 05:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
there is New Hampshire becoming a less
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
and less desirable place to live and so
 
05:03:41.090 --> 05:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
fewer and fewer people demand homes here
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
um or is it something else and my view
 
05:03:47.208 --> 05:03:47.218 align:start position:0%
is that the the data suggests that it's
 
05:03:48.530 --> 05:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
something else it's not that people
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to live here anymore for
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
whatever reason I mean our
 
05:03:54.530 --> 05:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
whatever our crime rate is too high or
 
05:03:56.208 --> 05:03:56.218 align:start position:0%
our taxes are too high that doesn't seem
 
05:03:58.730 --> 05:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
to be what's going on here uh that those
 
05:04:00.650 --> 05:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
things have not changed
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
um so what has changed is our cost of
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
living has gone way up so we're the
 
05:04:06.288 --> 05:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
eighth most costly State according to
 
05:04:08.810 --> 05:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of economic analysis we have
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
the second lowest fertility rate in the
 
05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
country so one of the findings uh in the
 
05:04:16.128 --> 05:04:16.138 align:start position:0%
literature is that the higher
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
um the more costly housing is the less
 
05:04:21.410 --> 05:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
likely you are to get families to form
 
05:04:23.390 --> 05:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
unless they're less likely to have kids
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
they can afford to they have to live in
 
05:04:28.490 --> 05:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
a small apartment they can't afford a a
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
house and the space to have kids or they
 
05:04:32.930 --> 05:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
have fewer kids because they don't have
 
05:04:34.850 --> 05:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
that space and so it's not surprising
 
05:04:36.830 --> 05:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
that our fertility rate would be so low
 
05:04:40.850 --> 05:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
that people aren't having kids here and
 
05:04:43.128 --> 05:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
so you combine the two things tends to
 
05:04:45.230 --> 05:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
be older people who are wealthier and
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
can afford costly housing and uh costly
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
housing also causes young people to have
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
fewer kids or also the second oldest
 
05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
state in the country by median age
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh this also means that the people who
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
tend to live and stay here the people
 
05:05:03.170 --> 05:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
who move here the people who stay here
 
05:05:04.610 --> 05:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
tend to be wealthier than average
 
05:05:07.010 --> 05:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
because if you are poorer than average
 
05:05:10.128 --> 05:05:10.138 align:start position:0%
you probably want to go move to Texas or
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that's cheap right and so
 
05:05:15.170 --> 05:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
the research does show this that
 
05:05:17.810 --> 05:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
Americans in general are moving away
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
from high-wage regions to low-wage
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
Regions which seems surprising why would
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
you move away from a high wage region to
 
05:05:27.770 --> 05:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
a low-wage region and the answer is cost
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
of living because the low-wage regions
 
05:05:32.090 --> 05:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
have even lower cost of living so once
 
05:05:33.530 --> 05:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
you control for that you're actually
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
better off moving to the Sun Belt you
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
know from from California or the
 
05:05:39.550 --> 05:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
Northeast because
 
05:05:42.288 --> 05:05:42.298 align:start position:0%
you can afford the housing there
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
so we we have ended up with the eighth
 
05:05:45.610 --> 05:05:45.620 align:start position:0%
highest median income in the country
 
05:05:47.810 --> 05:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
maybe some of that is due to good
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
economic policies but probably a lot of
 
05:05:51.650 --> 05:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
it is also just to this sorting effect
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
where only the wealthier people can
 
05:05:56.208 --> 05:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
afford to live here I do also find
 
05:05:57.770 --> 05:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire there's more
 
05:06:00.530 --> 05:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic segregation so again this
 
05:06:02.208 --> 05:06:02.218 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit hard to read here
 
05:06:05.448 --> 05:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
but uh in terms of the the town names
 
05:06:07.910 --> 05:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
but the relationship here is is positive
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
between two variables the first is the
 
05:06:12.530 --> 05:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
degree of housing regulation early in
 
05:06:14.810 --> 05:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
the 2000s basically right so how
 
05:06:17.330 --> 05:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
restrictive was regulation back then and
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
on the y-axis we have change in median
 
05:06:23.330 --> 05:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
household income from 2000 to 2015.
 
05:06:25.128 --> 05:06:25.138 align:start position:0%
okay so what we're finding with this
 
05:06:26.868 --> 05:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
positive relationship is that places
 
05:06:29.330 --> 05:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
that started out more regulated in the
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
early 2000s subsequently became richer
 
05:06:35.930 --> 05:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
over the next decade and a half now why
 
05:06:39.230 --> 05:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
did that happen was it that zoning laws
 
05:06:40.970 --> 05:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
made their workers more productive and
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
they could earn more at work that
 
05:06:45.170 --> 05:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't I don't I don't know any
 
05:06:46.730 --> 05:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
mechanism that would account for that
 
05:06:48.410 --> 05:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
but what's probably happening is that
 
05:06:50.330 --> 05:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
lower income households are moving away
 
05:06:52.368 --> 05:06:52.378 align:start position:0%
from the places that are more regulated
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
so what we tend to get is a kind of
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
bifurcation where some towns like
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
Amherst and Hanover and places like that
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
um don't grow very much but the people
 
05:07:05.110 --> 05:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
who stay there are the wealthier ones
 
05:07:09.230 --> 05:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
and then other towns like Kanan and
 
05:07:12.890 --> 05:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
Allenstown and uh Pittsfield uh those
 
05:07:14.570 --> 05:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
are the places that are affordable and
 
05:07:16.368 --> 05:07:16.378 align:start position:0%
so lower income households tend to move
 
05:07:17.930 --> 05:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
there and so you get lower income
 
05:07:19.368 --> 05:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
households in some towns and higher
 
05:07:21.050 --> 05:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
income households in other towns we get
 
05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
that kind of increasing sort of
 
05:07:25.810 --> 05:07:25.820 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic segregation in the state
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right um so that's that's it for me
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
05:07:32.208 --> 05:07:32.218 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss orange are
 
05:07:38.090 --> 05:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:40.190 --> 05:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
05:07:41.448 --> 05:07:41.458 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:07:41.458 --> 05:07:42.470 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:07:44.810 --> 05:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm looking at your maps and
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
data and stuff now you take a town like
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
Newington which has a very low tax rate
 
05:07:54.170 --> 05:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
because of the you know the malls and
 
05:07:56.510 --> 05:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
the industry around but
 
05:07:59.090 --> 05:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
I predict that malls are dying what do
 
05:07:59.868 --> 05:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
you think is going to happen to
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
Newington oh that's yeah it's hard to
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's hard to speculate but certainly you
 
05:08:07.128 --> 05:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
would expect that if
 
05:08:10.490 --> 05:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
um commercial tax base went down they'd
 
05:08:13.070 --> 05:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
have to raise their taxes and that could
 
05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
also reduce demand for housing there so
 
05:08:17.628 --> 05:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
there's an interesting relationship in
 
05:08:21.050 --> 05:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
that a town that has some good fortune
 
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
or good planning to attract commercial
 
05:08:26.208 --> 05:08:26.218 align:start position:0%
development and reduce its tax rate then
 
05:08:28.128 --> 05:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
sees people want to buy houses there to
 
05:08:29.750 --> 05:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the lower tax rate and
 
05:08:32.930 --> 05:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
so the value of homes goes up there I've
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
seen this in in my region I live in
 
05:08:34.920 --> 05:08:36.128 align:start position:0%
seen this in in my region I live in
Amherst

05:08:36.128 --> 05:08:36.138 align:start position:0%
Amherst
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
Bedford has lower tax rates and higher
 
05:08:42.170 --> 05:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
home values than Amherst because Bedford
 
05:08:43.310 --> 05:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
has allowed a little bit more
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
development and so you know you could
 
05:08:49.250 --> 05:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
say that that is their good luck or it
 
05:08:51.890 --> 05:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
could be their good planning to allow
 
05:08:54.350 --> 05:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
for that and and you know provide the
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
represent walls thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:09:03.650 --> 05:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
could you email this PowerPoint
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
presentation to the committee absolutely
 
05:09:07.970 --> 05:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
excellent work by the way thank you
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative um McConkey thank you
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so one of one of
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
the areas or probably other than adus on
 
05:09:20.330 --> 05:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
your uh Maps if I was paying attention
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
correctly was manufactured homes and I
 
05:09:29.050 --> 05:09:29.060 align:start position:0%
know up north several towns had parks
 
05:09:31.850 --> 05:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
and they didn't want more Parks so then
 
05:09:33.730 --> 05:09:33.740 align:start position:0%
they says more homes could be out
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes could be on land
 
05:09:39.368 --> 05:09:39.378 align:start position:0%
right as opposed to an art
 
05:09:41.930 --> 05:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
and I don't see
 
05:09:45.850 --> 05:09:45.860 align:start position:0%
a movement when you look at the cost of
 
05:09:49.970 --> 05:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
developing a manufactured home parks or
 
05:09:52.690 --> 05:09:52.700 align:start position:0%
higher density for that
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
clustered yeah and most towns then Zone
 
05:09:59.810 --> 05:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
that out because they want one per acre
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
and so forth but it would seem that
 
05:10:04.970 --> 05:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
have great opportunity from what you say
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
that's right and um this does not
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
distinguish between this map does not
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
distinguish between parks and individual
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
Lots but we have that data and so once
 
05:10:21.890 --> 05:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
the the Alice is released we'll show
 
05:10:24.410 --> 05:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
where our manufactured homes allowed in
 
05:10:25.850 --> 05:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
parks where they allowed on individual
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
Lots where are they allowed on either
 
05:10:27.958 --> 05:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
Lots where are they allowed on either
way

05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:10:31.550 --> 05:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and I can say just
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
impressionistically based on on my work
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
on these data that yeah most towns are
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
leaning toward allowing them on
 
05:10:42.530 --> 05:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
individual Lots but not in Parks but
 
05:10:43.970 --> 05:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
there are there are many that go the
 
05:10:46.310 --> 05:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
other way and so it tends to be you know
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
towns that are very worried about a
 
05:10:49.788 --> 05:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
certain conception of community
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
character will often say yes have a lot
 
05:10:54.890 --> 05:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
of parks over in this part of town but
 
05:10:56.810 --> 05:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
then no manufactured housing anywhere
 
05:11:00.410 --> 05:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
else whereas those that don't
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know so much care will allow them
 
05:11:06.650 --> 05:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
anywhere and and you you see that um you
 
05:11:08.330 --> 05:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
know I've just noticed driving around
 
05:11:09.948 --> 05:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
there are more manufactured housing
 
05:11:11.448 --> 05:11:11.458 align:start position:0%
Parks than you'd expect they're tucked
 
05:11:12.770 --> 05:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
away in various places and they don't
 
05:11:15.530 --> 05:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
often look like it but even Amherst has
 
05:11:17.930 --> 05:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
them and you would think that uh you
 
05:11:19.128 --> 05:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
know a town like Amherst would have
 
05:11:20.330 --> 05:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
tried to Zone them out but they haven't
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
so but some form they're allowed they're
 
05:11:25.250 --> 05:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
allowed most of the state
 
05:11:27.410 --> 05:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
05:11:29.280 --> 05:11:30.128 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
question

05:11:30.128 --> 05:11:30.138 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:11:33.410 --> 05:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
and maybe you know also we talk
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes how about ordinances
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
against mobile homes because I I have a
 
05:11:41.448 --> 05:11:41.458 align:start position:0%
picture in my mind what a manufactured
 
05:11:43.368 --> 05:11:43.378 align:start position:0%
home is it comes in on a trailer you put
 
05:11:45.170 --> 05:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
both halves together that's manufactured
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
but a mobile home you're backing on a
 
05:11:49.368 --> 05:11:49.378 align:start position:0%
slab and the axles and the tongue stay
 
05:11:51.770 --> 05:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
right on it are those what do you have
 
05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
any study on whether those are allowed
 
05:11:55.070 --> 05:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
around the state yeah so according to
 
05:11:57.530 --> 05:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
state law mobile homes count as
 
05:12:00.288 --> 05:12:00.298 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes so
 
05:12:02.208 --> 05:12:02.218 align:start position:0%
um so yeah so towns are no longer
 
05:12:03.650 --> 05:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
allowed to make a distinction between
 
05:12:09.410 --> 05:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
they um they count the mobile homes as
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes and then a lot of
 
05:12:18.170 --> 05:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
people call me and I don't I don't sell
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
trailers you know we do the modular
 
05:12:24.470 --> 05:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
homes but a lot of people are inquiring
 
05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
you know about the manufactured homes
 
05:12:28.850 --> 05:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
but you don't get a lot of them on
 
05:12:32.090 --> 05:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
single family lots because the land's so
 
05:12:32.100 --> 05:12:33.128 align:start position:0%
single family lots because the land's so
expensive

05:12:33.128 --> 05:12:33.138 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
right you know you're going to buy a an
 
05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
expensive lot and put a mobile home on
 
05:12:40.128 --> 05:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
05:12:42.590 --> 05:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
right you don't see that very often no
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
yeah not the best bang for your buck
 
05:12:47.090 --> 05:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
yeah and there's there's obviously
 
05:12:49.250 --> 05:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
modular pre-site built housing is
 
05:12:52.850 --> 05:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
another affordable option that uh and we
 
05:12:54.650 --> 05:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
didn't we didn't code this explicitly
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
but I haven't seen any ordinance that
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
tries to restrict pre-site built housing
 
05:13:03.128 --> 05:13:03.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:05.690 --> 05:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
okay oh thank you okay
 
05:13:07.930 --> 05:13:07.940 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification modular
 
05:13:10.010 --> 05:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
manufactured and mobile homes are all
 
05:13:11.510 --> 05:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
set on us at this point in time but I
 
05:13:12.890 --> 05:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
think of a modular home it's something
 
05:13:14.930 --> 05:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
that might be a bit more involved than a
 
05:13:16.970 --> 05:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
ranch with two halves I used to work at
 
05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
Westfield when I was back today we would
 
05:13:20.208 --> 05:13:20.218 align:start position:0%
you know you'd have a 3 000 square foot
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
Garrison would be six modules and uh
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
stacked with a crane but that's all
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
encompassing is it not
 
05:13:29.090 --> 05:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
um actually well pre-site built housing
 
05:13:31.910 --> 05:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
where you have like prefab sections of
 
05:13:33.288 --> 05:13:33.298 align:start position:0%
the house that you then come and put
 
05:13:35.330 --> 05:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
together on a fixed Foundation that's
 
05:13:37.128 --> 05:13:37.138 align:start position:0%
not considered manufactured housing
 
05:13:39.050 --> 05:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
actually manufactured housing is if it's
 
05:13:40.730 --> 05:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
the whole unit
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:47.650 --> 05:13:47.660 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative McConkey
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
having owned several Parks uh
 
05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured home comes complete as you
 
05:13:55.610 --> 05:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
said heating system you tie in the water
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
your town and tie in the sewer modular
 
05:14:01.610 --> 05:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
comes off the frame there's it's it was
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
the stigma of mobile home that's been
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
well thank you I'm I I just have a
 
05:14:15.830 --> 05:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
question with you know our charge on the
 
05:14:18.110 --> 05:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
committee is to help alleviate the
 
05:14:20.930 --> 05:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and you're an expert on
 
05:14:23.330 --> 05:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire zoning laws so if you had
 
05:14:25.788 --> 05:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
you know there's no magic bullet but
 
05:14:27.890 --> 05:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
if you had some sort of suggestion what
 
05:14:29.690 --> 05:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
would you give us
 
05:14:32.090 --> 05:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean um you know I'm not here to
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
Advocate on on behalf of any particular
 
05:14:36.770 --> 05:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
policies but I will say that um
 
05:14:39.368 --> 05:14:39.378 align:start position:0%
certainly land use regulations are
 
05:14:41.810 --> 05:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
appear to be according to this research
 
05:14:44.690 --> 05:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
a big part of the restriction and supply
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
and rise in cost of housing and so in
 
05:14:51.288 --> 05:14:51.298 align:start position:0%
general if if the state can incentivize
 
05:14:54.730 --> 05:14:54.740 align:start position:0%
or maybe even judiciously mandate
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
zoning changes for municipalities that
 
05:14:59.628 --> 05:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
would allow for more housing of various
 
05:15:03.770 --> 05:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
types that is going to result in more
 
05:15:07.010 --> 05:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
housing and and a decrease in costs uh
 
05:15:09.410 --> 05:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
now exactly how you do that is obviously
 
05:15:12.350 --> 05:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
there are many ideas and there are
 
05:15:14.090 --> 05:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
several bills in the in the current
 
05:15:19.010 --> 05:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
session and and uh I'm even testify
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
about some of them but um but I will say
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
that uh this is an area that deserves
 
05:15:27.410 --> 05:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:30.590 --> 05:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:33.170 --> 05:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
I mean I feel ashamed to not have more
 
05:15:35.930 --> 05:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
questions because I love I like there's
 
05:15:37.788 --> 05:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
just like so much data that I feel like
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's just right for questions but
 
05:15:40.440 --> 05:15:41.570 align:start position:0%
it's just right for questions but
um

05:15:41.570 --> 05:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:44.030 --> 05:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
but you explained it very well so I
 
05:15:46.610 --> 05:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
guess I didn't have that many but
 
05:15:46.620 --> 05:15:47.690 align:start position:0%
guess I didn't have that many but
um

05:15:47.690 --> 05:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
so you seem to be focused a lot on
 
05:15:55.310 --> 05:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
um the specific zoning
 
05:15:55.320 --> 05:15:56.930 align:start position:0%
um the specific zoning
um

05:15:56.930 --> 05:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
um kind of restrictions
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
um did you
 
05:16:07.670 --> 05:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
account for or uh control for kind of
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
like regulatory
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
apparatuses we were talking about like
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
fire earlier today we were talking about
 
05:16:17.868 --> 05:16:17.878 align:start position:0%
like um maybe code
 
05:16:19.730 --> 05:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
um enforcements that
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
may be layered on top of zoning that may
 
05:16:25.850 --> 05:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
be an issue uh
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
did you stumble on any of that or
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
control for that or how what what did
 
05:16:33.470 --> 05:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
you I mean some some towns do amend the
 
05:16:36.288 --> 05:16:36.298 align:start position:0%
State Building Code and in general I
 
05:16:37.970 --> 05:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
would expect that those amendments would
 
05:16:39.650 --> 05:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
add at least a little bit to the cost of
 
05:16:41.090 --> 05:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
housing because it's just at least
 
05:16:43.010 --> 05:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
something else to to deal with and learn
 
05:16:45.948 --> 05:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
about and maybe get a a permit for as a
 
05:16:49.368 --> 05:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
as a um as a developer
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
um but these are those are not part of
 
05:16:53.448 --> 05:16:53.458 align:start position:0%
the zoning Atlas
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
um they don't regulate any of the
 
05:16:58.368 --> 05:16:58.378 align:start position:0%
variables that we track in terms of the
 
05:17:00.770 --> 05:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
dimensions of lots or size of buildings
 
05:17:00.780 --> 05:17:02.150 align:start position:0%
dimensions of lots or size of buildings
or

05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:17:05.090 --> 05:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
um uh you know one versus five family
 
05:17:05.100 --> 05:17:08.208 align:start position:0%
um uh you know one versus five family
structures

05:17:08.208 --> 05:17:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.050 --> 05:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
um there is some research out there from
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
other experts around the country who
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
have looked at life safety and energy
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
codes and to what extent they have some
 
05:17:22.730 --> 05:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
impact on the cost of housing
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
um there there's definitely much much
 
05:17:30.770 --> 05:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
secondary to to zoning regulations but
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
um there aren't maybe a few things in
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
the building code that contribute to the
 
05:17:37.730 --> 05:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
cost of housing a very popular one that
 
05:17:39.650 --> 05:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
that researchers are talking a lot about
 
05:17:41.208 --> 05:17:41.218 align:start position:0%
now is
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
um multiple stairway requirements in
 
05:17:45.770 --> 05:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
multi-family buildings that that ends up
 
05:17:48.110 --> 05:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
using a lot of space and requiring an
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
interior Corridor
 
05:17:52.368 --> 05:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
um so in Europe for instance building
 
05:17:54.890 --> 05:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
codes don't require that at least up to
 
05:17:57.288 --> 05:17:57.298 align:start position:0%
a certain height so there's
 
05:18:00.410 --> 05:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
um possibly some potential for reform
 
05:18:00.420 --> 05:18:02.930 align:start position:0%
um possibly some potential for reform
there

05:18:02.930 --> 05:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:02.940 --> 05:18:04.788 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:18:07.810 --> 05:18:07.820 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
what about
 
05:18:10.440 --> 05:18:11.448 align:start position:0%
what about
um

05:18:11.448 --> 05:18:11.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:11.458 --> 05:18:13.368 align:start position:0%
um
these

05:18:13.368 --> 05:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:18:15.470 --> 05:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
we talked you kind of touched a little
 
05:18:17.330 --> 05:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
05:18:17.340 --> 05:18:19.550 align:start position:0%
bit about
um

05:18:19.550 --> 05:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
places going above and beyond kind of
 
05:18:29.090 --> 05:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
like this the soil requirements of of uh
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
05:18:34.128 --> 05:18:34.138 align:start position:0%
this the area right so they're saying
 
05:18:35.810 --> 05:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
you know you can only have one lot per
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
or one one unit per acre let's say when
 
05:18:43.010 --> 05:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
when the ground could sustain three
 
05:18:45.948 --> 05:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
units per acre or something like that do
 
05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
you think that um did you
 
05:18:53.390 --> 05:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh in my town we definitely only look at
 
05:18:57.530 --> 05:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
like unit like lot size acre
 
05:19:00.650 --> 05:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
um but I I recently heard from someone
 
05:19:03.890 --> 05:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
in one of the towns I represent that
 
05:19:03.900 --> 05:19:05.810 align:start position:0%
in one of the towns I represent that
they

05:19:05.810 --> 05:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:19:08.510 --> 05:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
um are much more focused on
 
05:19:11.448 --> 05:19:11.458 align:start position:0%
um not saying necessarily A Lot unit per
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
acre but saying like unit per soil type
 
05:19:19.128 --> 05:19:19.138 align:start position:0%
or like per acre kind of a thing
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
um did you
 
05:19:20.580 --> 05:19:22.128 align:start position:0%
um did you
sure

05:19:22.128 --> 05:19:22.138 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:19:25.970 --> 05:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
um did you do any research as far as uh
 
05:19:29.448 --> 05:19:29.458 align:start position:0%
of that of how how widespread that
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
effort is to say like we're going to set
 
05:19:37.010 --> 05:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
some metrics for size based on based on
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh soil types or the conditions on the
 
05:19:43.610 --> 05:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
ground versus where we you know like to
 
05:19:46.550 --> 05:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
centrally plan we just think that 200
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
square 200 foot Frontage looks best or
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
whatever kind of a thing and so that's
 
05:19:54.830 --> 05:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
what they they impose do you did you do
 
05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
any of that kind of research yeah so
 
05:19:58.010 --> 05:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
this there's quite a bit of variation
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
there quite a few communities uh very
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
minimum lot sizes or frontages or
 
05:20:06.530 --> 05:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
maximum densities by availability of
 
05:20:09.410 --> 05:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
utilities water and sewer and by soil
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
type so Londonderry for instance does a
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
little of both so there's a you know if
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
you have sewer you don't look at the
 
05:20:19.128 --> 05:20:19.138 align:start position:0%
soil map but if you don't then you do
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
look at this at the soil map on to
 
05:20:23.690 --> 05:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
determine what the density is
 
05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
um in the large majority of cases
 
05:20:30.170 --> 05:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
municipalities are requiring a lower
 
05:20:35.208 --> 05:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
density than the Des requires for septic
 
05:20:38.030 --> 05:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
um so it is still soil based but it's
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
not necessarily exactly the same as what
 
05:20:45.288 --> 05:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
the state says is a uh you know is uh is
 
05:20:48.410 --> 05:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
an acceptable density to to allow uh
 
05:20:52.550 --> 05:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:54.470 --> 05:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative cocky
 
05:20:56.570 --> 05:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman in that
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
conversation you you haven't actually
 
05:21:02.570 --> 05:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
tallied who those towns are have you
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
um I have uh that this is in the in the
 
05:21:09.230 --> 05:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
data set we have a um we we look at
 
05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
whether the minimum lot size can vary by
 
05:21:14.690 --> 05:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
other conditions and would just say you
 
05:21:16.250 --> 05:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
know we have the average the average
 
05:21:19.250 --> 05:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size over the conditions and
 
05:21:20.810 --> 05:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
then we have like the minimum like under
 
05:21:22.550 --> 05:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
ideal conditions what would your minimum
 
05:21:24.050 --> 05:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
lot size be and then the maximum under
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
the worst possible conditions what would
 
05:21:27.170 --> 05:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
your minimum lot size be so that's all
 
05:21:29.810 --> 05:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
in the in this vast spreadsheet that we
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
put together thank you that'd be worth
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you yeah and when does that
 
05:21:36.050 --> 05:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
come out it's supposed to come out next
 
05:21:36.060 --> 05:21:37.128 align:start position:0%
come out it's supposed to come out next
month

05:21:37.128 --> 05:21:37.138 align:start position:0%
month
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I've heard the the date March 20
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
floated but it could be we'll have to
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
see right the website is still being
 
05:21:45.650 --> 05:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
built so we don't know for certain
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
um but uh yeah the the data set is is
 
05:21:52.250 --> 05:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
large you've got about 200 variables and
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
there are two over two thousand zoning
 
05:21:58.128 --> 05:21:58.138 align:start position:0%
districts so it's well over 400 000
 
05:22:00.288 --> 05:22:00.298 align:start position:0%
individual pieces of data so there's a
 
05:22:01.850 --> 05:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
lot to dig into that's like a lot of
 
05:22:03.770 --> 05:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
internal yeah
 
05:22:05.090 --> 05:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
um are you
 
05:22:06.650 --> 05:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
um are you interested in coming back
 
05:22:08.810 --> 05:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
when it comes out with um maybe your
 
05:22:10.970 --> 05:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
counterpart from CNAs absolutely um
 
05:22:14.030 --> 05:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
present on more in detail on that so
 
05:22:16.010 --> 05:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
probably the end of March early April
 
05:22:18.530 --> 05:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
happy to do that perfectly
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right so I feel like we've had a
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
long pack day I've learned a lot
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
um I think that maybe we can come back
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
in a few weeks and discuss before we
 
05:22:31.850 --> 05:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
have more presentations about what we
 
05:22:33.170 --> 05:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
learned kind of refresh our memories on
 
05:22:35.090 --> 05:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
stuff and go forward but I kind of have
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
a couple things that I'd like to look at
 
05:22:38.868 --> 05:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
in the rsas so um but if you have any
 
05:22:41.330 --> 05:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
suggestions of people to come present
 
05:22:43.128 --> 05:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
um about housing I think representative
 
05:22:44.930 --> 05:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
Gibbs suggested a few
 
05:22:46.128 --> 05:22:46.138 align:start position:0%
um just feel free to send them my way
 
05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:53.810 --> 05:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
yep so can you block off where is it
 
05:22:57.530 --> 05:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
yes the morning of the 17th
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
um yeah well not the afternoon but the
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
morning in case you're doing
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:07.368 --> 05:23:07.378 align:start position:0%
start recruiting
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
March I'm looking at March 17th from 9
 
05:23:15.010 --> 05:23:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:17.810 --> 05:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
nine to noon we wouldn't go in the
 
05:23:17.820 --> 05:23:19.190 align:start position:0%
nine to noon we wouldn't go in the
afternoon

05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
05:23:22.970 --> 05:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
fourth and uh in the thirty person but
 
05:23:25.250 --> 05:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
um definitely definitely March 31st
 
05:23:26.690 --> 05:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
Please block that off I have people
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
coming from Virginia
 
05:23:31.490 --> 05:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
um a think tank in Virginia yeah we'll
 
05:23:34.270 --> 05:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
keep the 17th up in here
 
05:23:36.410 --> 05:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy doesn't want to meet
 
05:23:39.830 --> 05:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:41.208 --> 05:23:41.218 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a committee it's going
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:46.310 --> 05:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah perfect well if there's anything
 
05:23:48.110 --> 05:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
else like to adjourn
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
thanks guys
 
05:23:50.280 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
thanks guys
