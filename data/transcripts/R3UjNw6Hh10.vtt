during your executive session and
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
explain this amendment that we've put
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
together I uh worked our group of
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
citizens from Littleton worked
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh through me uh and also um in
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
consultation and we worked with Rick
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
Newman the lobbyist for the casino group
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
and um brought forward these changes and
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
I've sent an email last night to
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
describe a bit of that process and um I
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
apologize to those who are substitute
 
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
that you didn't get that directly from
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
me uh but I will capsule this uh we did
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
change the previous one we eliminated uh
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
two sections and we only have one
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
section now of the bill it used to be
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
the third section this is the local
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
option for games of chance the game of
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
chance employer license is the substrate
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's the holding uh license for all of
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
the games that are played in the casino
 
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
and so this is the spot to get um the
 
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
best decisions made and so in um it will
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
add a section 287d 30 to um local option
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
games of chance in that um anyone who is
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
the first section exempts those who are
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
basically renewing a license so if
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
they're already in place and they have
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
to get their renewal every two years or
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
three years depending upon how that
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
resolves in other venues um they do not
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
have to get this local option going this
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
is only for new uh casinos that are um
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
planned for community in a uh it talks
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
about these are basically drawn from the
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
statute that covers local option for
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
Kino it was almost directly um copied
 
00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
from that so A Town would be petitioned
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
to put it on the ballot if it passes um
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
then the casino could go in that town in
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
a city there's a petition that goes in a
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
different way and still it goes on the
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
ballot a majority would allow the casino
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
to operate in that town um there's a
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing under see the wording of
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
the the uh referendum or the the
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
um how how it goes on the ballot in a
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
Roman two three if it's not approved it
 
00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
can be later done at the as early as the
 
00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:22.750 align:start position:0%
can be later done at the as early as the
next

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.269 align:start position:0%
next
year

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
there are those who are exempt from this
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
who are not yet licensed and those um Mr
 
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
Newman referred to as in the pipeline
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
there are five applications in um
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
process in holding pattern over at the
 
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission and those five
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
applications are exempt from this local
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
ordinance or this local um option thing
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
just as an aside that's not exactly what
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
Littleton wanted but nonetheless it will
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
be good for the whole state um any other
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
community that is approached by a casino
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
would have that opportunity to either
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
welcome them or um refuse entry in uh
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 it's how to remove that
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
permission and this applies to all
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
casinos even currently operating even
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
those in the pipeline that if after 7
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
years they haven't opened
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
or if after seven years there's seven
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
years of them being closed not in use
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
for any reason at all um then the town
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
can put forward a petition to resend or
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
um remove the permission for them to
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
operate in that town and that if passed
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
would have to cover a threshold of 60%
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
of the vote um an unincorporated place
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
has the same threshold but it goes
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
through the delegation could you hold up
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
one second um could you speak
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
specifically to just what has been
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
changed since the last one we don't need
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
a a a rehash of the main body of the
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
bill just what the amendment does thank
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um actually almost done
 
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
with that long winded thing um but um
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
what changed was um protecting the ones
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
in the pipeline what changed were the
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
number of years in is 7 years the other
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
one was three and 10 3 years to start or
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
to open 10 years of not being open at
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
all of of nonuse it they're both seven
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
now seven years not open seven years um
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
before opening in the Roman 4 I'm sorry
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
Roman 8 if they have voted the town has
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
voted not to have games of chance
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
commercially in their Community they
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
could on ordinance allow a certain
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
number of days that local um Charities
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
could run their own casino night as is
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
accustom sometimes now and that's
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
covered by another RSA 287
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
D4 they could do that okay thank
 
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.590 align:start position:0%
D4 they could do that okay thank

turn off the mic please she's
representative

00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
stavis we're just going to Talk Amongst
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves now turn off the mic
 
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
please so I have a number of questions
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
and um observations about the amendment
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
what's missing I believe and yes the did
 
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
come in very late so if I've missed it
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
my apologies but what's missing is any
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
mention of historical horse racing
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
correct and I think I can speak to that
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
okay I think we heard in testimony prior
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
that historical horse racing can only be
 
00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh brought in
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
if this here the casino already exists
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
so I think they removed she's shaking
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
her head yes and Curtis is shaking his
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
head yes so I think they remove that
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
maybe to make it a little bit
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
simpler um should I continue go ahead uh
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
in lines 11 12 13 and 14 uh where it
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
sets the the limit of the recision of
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
permission in Lebanon the casino
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
operators had to go before the planning
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
board which
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
took more than six months just to go
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
through the planning board process
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
process I don't know how how long it
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
took before that to get ready to go
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
through the planning board process and
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if this number of um seven
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
years might conflict with planning board
 
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
processes in other municipalities where
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
things just tend to take a long time and
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
through no fault of the casino
 
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.230 align:start position:0%
through no fault of the casino
operator's

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
operator's
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
own much as I may not
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
be in favor of casinos but that's beside
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
the point this may conflict with those
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
two things may conflict with one another
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned about that I don't
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
believe they do I'll try to answer as
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
best I can and we can watch the shaking
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
heads or the whatever up there um the
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
way I read this it says that this is
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's only after the approval has been
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
granted uh the seven years so once the
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
seven-year and I'm seeing
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
what approval approval from what
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
Authority uh the gaming I would say the
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
gaming commission or the I think it's
 
00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:17.789 align:start position:0%
gaming commission or the I think it's
the

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
municipality the paragraph above talks
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
about license by the
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
lottery as of May 2021 so I'm assuming
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
that's once they go through the approval
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
um as de mentioned there's five existing
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
Casino applications right
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
now right none of these none of those
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
would be affected by this and I believe
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
those have would have to be approved
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
once those are
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
approved by the gaming commissions they
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
have seven years to basically begin
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
operation otherwise the municipality
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
would then have the ab ility to resend
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
am I reading that correctly I'm seeing a
 
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:11.390 align:start position:0%
am I reading that correctly I'm seeing a
head

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
shaken repres representative savs I
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
think it's just unclear okay in in the
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
amendment as it's presented to what what
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
approval this refers to is it
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission is it the plan
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
board is
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
it is it the
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
municipality that is empowered to say
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
yes or no by this bill I would say it
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
the one you're looking at it talks about
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 28 287d so I would assume that where
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
they talk about the approval process
 
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.029 align:start position:0%
they talk about the approval process
representative

00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh thank you Mr chairman how
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
many total licenses are they going to
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
allow in the state do you know is there
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
know representative
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
yell thank you um so the the legislative
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
uh body uh the house is already passed a
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
moratorium on additional um
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
applications um so at this point
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is is the number and
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
this bill only talks about new numbers
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
which are going to be sometime in the
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
future since there's a currently a
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
moratorium and so um since the
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
moratorium is lasting for multiple years
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's no rush with this legislation to
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
to be Um this can be filed normally in
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
in uh due course and have its hearing
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
and be fully vetted um but by what I
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
believe to be the correct committee and
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
also I think they there is a lack of um
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
in this amendment as the previous
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
Amendment there is um a changing of the
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
ways that this that these establishments
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
can come about but there is no changing
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
of the means of the
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
um if a municipality decides that they
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
don't want a game of chance then I think
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
that that the discussion should be had
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
about what whether or not they should be
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the tax revenue of that
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
if they uh are um so opposed to um those
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
establishments in their Community also
 
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.470 align:start position:0%
establishments in their Community also
um

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
the games of chance can be regulated
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
through zoning to specific zones and so
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
I believe that this uh is not necessary
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
because it can already be handled by
 
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
zoning and it's um just because it
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't handled by zoning in the case
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
that was brought before us does not mean
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
that it cannot be and that um there is
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
no need I think for this specific uh
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
allowance that they could essentially
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
regulate it through zoning even though
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is currently already allowed and so
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that this is either
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
timely uh it is um imper that it
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
happened right away since all all of the
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard is not going
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
and even the bill in front of us is not
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
going to affect any of the people even
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the pipeline not even for the people
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
that have proposed proposed uh uh sites
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
yet and so it's just not just not
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
necessary at this time and so um I hope
 
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
you will join me in not supporting this
 
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.750 align:start position:0%
you will join me in not supporting this
amendment

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
chairman my thought briefly is about
 
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
planning board uh when we went through
 
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039 align:start position:0%
this and conquered we were only deciding
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
on the site plan we were not giving
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
approval to a casino so I think it would
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
be the planning board's role and that
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
plan representative Gallagher um so just
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify this is amendment
 
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.269 align:start position:0%
to clarify this is amendment
20241

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
20241
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
218h that we're currently on that is
 
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:37.720 align:start position:0%
correct representative power thank you
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman as as noted this new
 
00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:41.870 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman as as noted this new
Amendment

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
1218 it um differs from the previous
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
805h in that as the um we were it was
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
explained to us sections one and two
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
have been eliminated so that brings me
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
to um the question with regards to the
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
elimination of section two relative to
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
the local option of having historic
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
horse racing machines as I recall in the
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
hearing I did ask questions about this
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
likening um historic horse racing
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
machines to Kino and if I my
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
recollection is correct I was um we were
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
told during the hearing that historic
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
horse racing machines are not limited to
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
casinos and that they could those
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
machines could in fact be placed in say
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
like a gas station or Chinese restaurant
 
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
so if that is in fact um correct and
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
true I am confused as to
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
why the section two has been eliminated
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me like um that
 
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
would be an important section to retain
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
to allow for municipalities to have that
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
local option to weigh in yay or
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
nay thank you representa
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair um with all due
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
respect to representative power my
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
recollection from the hearing was that
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
gas stations and Chinese restaurants in
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps Texas do have the historic
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
racing machines but the way they are
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
defined here
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
they are in essence a subset of the
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
games of
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
chance and one would have to have a
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
casino license in order to install a
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
historic horse race machine in a gas
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
station Chinese restaurant what have you
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps some other members might
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
Recollections representative kahill uh
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes I do believe that
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
representative fra is exactly correct
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
that that it's exactly how it was
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
explained to us in the hearing
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
correct represent uh
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
for filling in that Gap in my memory um
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
now that that's been stated because I
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
was focused on my municipality and Kino
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
and the Bingo now I do recall that yes
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
you have to have a a gaming license so
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question to that is do you
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
need a license for
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
Kino I'm I'm just I'm trying to
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
understand the issue
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman so the other
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
night after our caucus I was concerned
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
about this bill trying to understand a
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
little bit more of the background so I
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
spent some time on Monday morning with
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
ol in regard to this and I wanted to
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
know how U the bill impacted uh
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
Littleton and how the bill uh could
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
potentially impact Conway and I also
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
spoke with representative Paige who was
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
a sponsor of the original bill so that
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
was clarified for me and and I guess um
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
kind of the basic summary of that is
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
people told me basically it's too late
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
for Littleton and it's too late for uh
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
Conway in regard to a bill of this type
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
and that uh Rochester for instance even
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
though they weren't operating uh they
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
were about to be able to start operating
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
so I understood what happened with the
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
original 15 and discussed with them
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
about where we would go forward with the
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
others that would be u in the future so
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
I I think several of the members
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
discussed uh the fact that um that
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that there's not a need for
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
this bill but based on the discussions
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
that I had with the uh on the sponsor of
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
the original bill and the background
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
that I got from OSS uh I feel that this
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
bill is indeed needed maybe not in this
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
exact format yet but the the idea was to
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
be proactive and making sure that the
 
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.990 align:start position:0%
be proactive and making sure that the
towns

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
understood uh what the requirements were
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh to have these gaming operations in
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
their towns uh and that several of these
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
towns were surprised Ur rised by the
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
fact that they didn't have any control
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
over this um so in regard to this bill
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
being timed on I think it is because it
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
sets forth what the regulations would be
 
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
moving forward for additional uh gaming
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
you representative K thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
I just kind of wanted to respond to
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative pow question about the
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
Kino um possibly maybe
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
we don't know the answer to that
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
question because this might belong in
 
00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:03.230 align:start position:0%
question because this might belong in
another

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
committee with the knowledge of those
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
comments okay uh just a couple I just
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'll recap what a a few items uh I sent
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
you all an email last night from uh Mr
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
Newman from the casino group um
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
basically saying that they had worked
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors and they were both in
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
agreement with this um July this would
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
become effective July one of this year I
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
know representative yella mentioned
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
moratorium I was on the assumption that
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
that was going to expire unless we had a
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
new yes it expires
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
um and the next um as been mentioned
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
Littleton um realizes that they won't
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
this won't apply to them it's a
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's coming in late same
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
with Conway
 
00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:01.430 align:start position:0%
with Conway
way

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
um it would give the ability of other
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the future to um say
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
yay or
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
nay regulated through zoning I don't
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
believe that's the case uh as Littleton
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
found out and I believe um if uh what' I
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
say and Lebanon I'm I'm hearing
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
um that cannot be done um
 
00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:32.029 align:start position:0%
um that cannot be done um
let's

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
see I know it's been mentioned not today
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
but in other venues that this this is a
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
money issue and should be part of ways
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
and means I'll disagree with that
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
because this does not affect any current
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
um money coming in I know there's an
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
issue of you know if somebody doesn't
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
uh allow a casino wi they shouldn't uh
 
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
get percentage I don't disagree with
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
that but is that the case with Kino I
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe that's the case if a town
 
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
says no to Kino I believe they still get
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
it um the last thing I'll say
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
is I I go I go neutral kind of neutral
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
on this bill I can see the pluses and
 
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
the minuses I'll say the one big thing
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
is if a a mun municipality should have
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to say yay or nay to Kino I
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
think um games of of chance is a kind of
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
A step above that and I would think that
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
uh by using pretty much the same
 
00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:38.470 align:start position:0%
uh by using pretty much the same
language

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
um as The Kino language that this I
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
really don't see the downside in it
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
again I I I come out kind of agnostic on
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
this but those are the points I just
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to get get
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
through representative
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
yella um thank you um I wholeheartedly
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
disagree um with the argument that you
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
can't um regulate this by zoning just
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
because those municipalities chose to to
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
Define in their zoning
 
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.950 align:start position:0%
Define in their zoning
um

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
entertainment that and and entertainment
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
is a wide ranging um term that doesn't
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
mean that they couldn't use another term
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
that is more specific and Define it in
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
zoning as um you know games of Champs
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
they could literally call uh a section
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
games of Champs owned by by uh you know
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh and defined in their zoning and say
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
it's permitted in this area it has
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
conditional use in that area it needs
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
special exception in that area there's
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
nothing in statute that bars them from
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
doing that now and so um if there is I'm
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
happy to for you to show me that r a
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
however I do not believe that it exists
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
so I would just make that
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
comment uh represent K yeah I mean I
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
just this is just a question um I if if
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
because I I I tend to agree with
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative UK I mean my town has
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
adopted zoning ordinances Banning
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
certain things from coming to town that
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
you know some people would want um
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
so but why can't the why couldn't this
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
just be a simple amendment to put a
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
comma next to wherever in statute and it
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
talks about Kino and games of chance why
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman um so in my
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
time with OS the other day I U I was led
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
to believe as representative yis said
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
that uh it was possible to limit um
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
limit gaming through through the zoning
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh requirements that uh they would have
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
to be more specific than what was
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
initially indicated as far as uh
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
entertainment zones um I checked with
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
molten Boro um yesterday as well and
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
they did not have anything that would
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit that but I wasn't uh really
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
speaking to someone that was expert on
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
that in the town yes they weren't
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
available but I was led to believe that
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
that would be a possible solution
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
although I wouldn't quote that specific
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
but that's what I was led to believe the
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
other day thank
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
comments okay seeing none uh we will
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
recess this um HP 1223 until 11 a.m. and
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
come back to that after our individual
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
coxes uh with that we'll go ahead and
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
1187 relative to prohibiting lease
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment for building and
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
facility improvements and I believe
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative of power has an amendment
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
to introduce thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
would like to offer to the committee
 
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.589 align:start position:0%
would like to offer to the committee
Amendment

00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
2024-25 n for your consideration do we
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
have a second on
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
that okay uh representative M McDonald
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
seconds and would you like to speak to
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chairman so um this uh
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh this uh Amendment
 
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.430 align:start position:0%
uh this uh Amendment
here

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
strike section two that um was discussed
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
and offered at the executive session
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
prior to when this bill was um pushed
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
until today so the the prior mment had
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
two sections the second section um had
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
these lease agreements as a special
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
warrant article that has been
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
removed and the minor change in the the
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
amendment before you section one Remains
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
the Same and that there was a um late
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the um inclusion of
 
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
three words and those words appear on
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
lines 15 and 16 and they are that become
 
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
fixtures so those three words modify
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
building or facility improvements that
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
become fixtures and that makes um it
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
very crystal clear that any accessory to
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
a piece of equipment may come under the
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
lease because they are non-permanent and
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
they are not fixed an example would be a
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
generator in the cabling required to
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
hook the generator up to the facility
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
the building so that type of accessory
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
parts to the main piece of equipment can
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
in fact be leased under this amendment
 
00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:56.510 align:start position:0%
in fact be leased under this amendment
thank

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
you % of
 
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
you % of
Gallagher

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.230 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
um

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
so uh at least personally um okay so the
 
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
intent may have been by using
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
fixtures um to make things clear I don't
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
think it does actually make things
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
clearer though um I think that um
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
there's still some ambiguity about what
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
precisely fixtures means um you know uh
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
you off you can sometimes hear it used
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
in a metaphorical St um sense for
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
example of like oh the municipal
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
Association lobbyists are a fixture of
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
our committee for example um but
 
00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:47.109 align:start position:0%
our committee for example um but
um

00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
so yeah I I I appreciate the attempts to
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
try to improve the wording here but I'm
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
successful uh representative power go
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
head now thank you Mr chairman and for
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
the sake of brevity I I I could talk
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
about this at length but I would like
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
the committee to be crystal clear that
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
the those three words came at the
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the New Hampshire
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association I was contacted um
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
late yesterday and um they recommended
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
upon further review I am quite certain
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the staff at the New Hampshire
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association is probably tired
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
of seeing amendments and drafts of this
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
particular bill so that being said this
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
has been um looked at by many
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
people and we are at the the wording
 
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
that is before us is is very precise and
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
correct it has been reviewed by
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal attorneys and I would further
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
note that the word fixtures is a legal
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
term and very well understand stood by
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal attorneys thank you

don't doubt that um fixtures is
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
understood by legal terms but what I
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
will speak to is a lifetime of someone
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
who has used tools and installed things
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
for his entire life and fixtures are
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
something that is permanently attached
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to be leasing
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
something that is permanently
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
attached if that's what you're using the
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%

of those three words in this amendment
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
if one would continue to read the
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
sentence it says building or facility
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
improvements that become fixtures
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
related to the installation purpose or
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
operation of such equipment shall not be
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%

lales just uh thank you Mr chairman U
just

just
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
a uh if I could pose a
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
question um a lot of communities now are
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
choosing to install solar panels on the
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
roofs of uh Municipal and School
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
District uh uh buildings
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
would they be
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
considered fixtures or would they be
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
least it's an excellent question
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
representative um see representative
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
Po's hand do you have an answer to that
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so um that would
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
be determined by the manner in which the
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
equipment is installed it has to do with
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
the the degree of the
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
installation a solar panel which can be
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
removed would be a piece of equipment
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
however it's my understanding that there
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
are Advanced um Technologies in which
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
the solar um technology is integrated
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
into the um Roofing uh material shingles
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
itself in that case um it would not that
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
that would that would be a fixed
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
item I hope that clarifies things and
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
and I will mention I think that's
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
exactly correct there's a different way
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
for panels to be either permanent or or
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
non-permanent I think that's correct
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else I saw no
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more discussion I guess
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
we can uh call the role on the amendment
 
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.109 align:start position:0%
we can uh call the role on the amendment
1229

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
h not in this one do do you need
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%

um sure we can do
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
that all right if we get to you we will
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
have you explain if we don't we won't
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
how's that okay so we've opened up the
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
exec s on HB 1181 and I believe
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative yella has a
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
motion um yes I have a motion to adopt
 
00:48:36.599 --> 00:48:38.270 align:start position:0%
motion um yes I have a motion to adopt
uh

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.630 align:start position:0%
uh
20241

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
20241
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
04h is there a second on
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
z48 H okay represent k k Hill
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
second they're they're all
 
00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:03.549 align:start position:0%
second they're they're all
pass

00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative yo Kell now would you
 
00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
like to speak to it sure I'm happy to um
 
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
so I believe that this is the simplest
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
of all the Amendments and I think it
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
gets really to the heart of what the
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor was trying to accomplish
 
00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:23.559 align:start position:0%
which was that they were addressing the
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
the problem inside of the statute which
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
lists a bunch of things that they can do
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
um however um it specifically says that
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
they have the power to accept at a
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
district facility and in the cases where
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
um a large trash uh producer brings
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
something to their facility um it may
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
reach that facility's capacity and
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
create headaches for additional uh um uh
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste for that day or that time
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
period or however long it takes them to
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
actually um move that along in the
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
process so they wanted to be able to
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
direct um
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
people direct the solid waste generated
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
inside of the boundaries of their
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
District they didn't want to be able to
 
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:14.839 align:start position:0%
do that for the entire state but just
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
within the boundaries of their District
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
to their contracted third- party um
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
person that was is going to do the
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
processing of this and so I felt like
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
the uh this language was a little bit
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
more clear than the original proposed
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
language and um and then also kind of
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
sidestepped all of the complicated
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
issues in um in two and three um of the
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
bill so thank you fur the comments
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh major first thank you
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um Mr chairman may I may I
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
read from what the prime sponsor of the
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
bill has sent over with regard to this
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
amendment you may you have the
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so um from the
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill representative
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
Vu um says the two sections that
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative yella that the
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
representative yella Amendment would
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
strike are the heart of the bill
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
allowing s Solid Waste districts to use
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
a manifest system like municipalities
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
and school districts would smooth out
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
the account payable process and ensure a
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
timely payment most Solid Waste
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
districts governing committees are
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
operated by volunteers often the only
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
reason the Committees meet is to approve
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
the payment of invoices if the committee
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
fails to get a quorum as often happens
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the summertime it may be weeks before
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
payment of invoices can be authorized
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
making payments overdue and in some
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
cases call finan cause financial
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
hardship for some of the vendors the
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
last change in the ellaa amendment in
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
extreme circumstances would allow Solid
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
Waste districts to appeal to the
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Services for
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
authorization to overspend their budgets
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
this option is only a last resort after
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
all other appeals have been exhausted
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
and is only possible and is only
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
possible if the district has a source of
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
funds already available as you can see
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
from the co-sponsor of the bill this is
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
non partis an issue it should be kept as
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
simple as a simple administrative
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
chairman uh representative
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman um I'm I'm
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
in support of the section one of the
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
various amendments to this bill I know
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're speaking to um
 
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
1048 and I also concur with the um
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
comments feedback that the previous
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative had had shared um with
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
regards to the three sections and this
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
amendment before us has eliminated to
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I did also speak to the um Prime
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor as well as I contacted Mr canoer
 
00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:03.799 align:start position:0%
from the Dr and had a very um
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive discussion with him
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday he is here today to um fill in
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
any gaps and to
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
review um based on from the
 
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.829 align:start position:0%
review um based on from the
hearing

00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
um the way that the information was
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
presented I I missed a lot of key
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
details and I would um concur that the
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
heart of the bill is sections two and
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
three those sections are extremely
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
important to solid waste management
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
districts and that's not um we don't
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
have that in statute and unfortunately
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's not here in the bill in in front of
 
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
us oh I had and I had a question so if
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
we adopt this amendment here in front of
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
us we can uh replace it by adopting
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
subsequent amendments is that
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
correct you would be able to do that
 
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
questions see uh representative
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
stavis I agree with what the previous
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
two speakers have said that this
 
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
amendment um eviscerates the bill and I
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
can't support
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
it for the
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
comments uh seeing that representative
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
power I'm inclined to um support this
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
amendment because it's a subset of
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent amendments so
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
um based on the the answer that if this
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
is adopted then other ones can replace
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.319 --> 00:54:56.829 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
sec for the Comm uh representative
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
PRI I will also be opposing the
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 1048 H and I instead I will
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
be supporting the one that's being
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the no can't do that okay
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you talking about this amendment
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brown thank
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I will not be
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment although it is
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
you representative power thank you Mr
 
00:55:41.069 --> 00:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
chairman so um my understanding has been
 
00:55:44.349 --> 00:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
corrected and um I will not be
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment due to the
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
clarification and the question that I
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
asked earlier thank you representative
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um I I think that that
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
is all wrong
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
that you can adopt an amendment and then
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
adopt a future Amendment they would have
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
to be merged and since all of the
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
Amendments actually include my language
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
the merging is there's no conflict
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
between the different Amendments of
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
adopting a further Amendment with
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
additional language um but it doesn't
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
really make any difference um uh in my
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
opinion whether we do it what if if some
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
people vote down the amendment and then
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know vote for a different Amendment
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
or not I think the result of the the
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
bill will probably end up being the
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
exact same no matter which way we move
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
forward further
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
comments give give me a couple minutes I
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
apologize my my head's still over the
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
North Atlantic today I'm not 100% so
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:25.150 align:start position:0%
 
sec

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
I I believe the the first answer I gave
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
on adopting another amendment over
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
another amendment whether it's the first
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
one passes or fails I think is correct
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I think representative yella kind of
 
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:09.799 align:start position:0%
confirmed that I don't know why it
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't um just sent something to the
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
clerk and we'll see if he answers here
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:30.589 align:start position:0%
 
case

00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.039 align:start position:0%
okay according to the clerk once an
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is adopted in the exact
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
session I asked can another one
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
supersede that and the clerk said no
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.990 align:start position:0%
 
recommendation

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
power I I don't I having trouble
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
comprehending that answer could you
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
click clarify or or state it
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
differently I could not that's exact I
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
that's basically it sounds once the
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
becomes becomes the bill the bill unless
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
unless there's no recommendation or of
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
course it fails representative
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
Lala thank you Mr chairman even though
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
the yella amendment is duplicated
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
exactly in the brown
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment there is no guarantee that the
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
brown Amendment will
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
pass so if we pass the ukel
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
amendment and the brown Amendment failed
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
then the bill would be the ukel
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
amendment uh so my my thought is since I
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
want everything in the brown Amendment
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote no on the ukel
 
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.750 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote no on the ukel
amendment

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
and as I said pass the brown
 
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay we're going to take a
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
five minute recess and I'm going to
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
clarify this with the clerk because I'm
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure we do this right
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
so uh we will recess this till
 
01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
so uh we will recess this till
1110

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
1110
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.589 align:start position:0%
1110
BAS

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.599 --> 01:00:31.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
there so
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
there they already have the ability to
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:24.910 align:start position:0%

uh continue now on HB
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
1181 uh currently we have an
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
amendment allows them to do it see what
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I'm trying to okay that would
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
be my as soon as representative Brown
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
conversation all right so here's the
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
deal I spoke with the clerk um we can
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
certainly do this amendment another one
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
can be introduced at the end depending
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
where we are they can U we would have to
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
merge them with OLS I don't didn't think
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
he understood that we have three parts
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
part one two and three and I would
 
01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:09.070 align:start position:0%
part one two and three and I would
assume

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
assume
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
our U the way we'd go about it would be
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
number one number two and number three
 
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
so um right now we have under
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
discussion the amendment 1048 which is
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh the Oella Amendment Is there further
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
that okay I see no others I'll I'll make
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
my comment um I'm I'm in favor of this
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe as we include more
 
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
and more I become less
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%

01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
H do we have a second on
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%

bar yes Mr chairman um I in doing this
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
after our caucus the other night uh felt
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate to include
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative was Amendment as well as
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
the to allow section two to be in this
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
bill I did not have section three in the
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill because I felt it uh was not needed
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
I felt that uh if the if the funds were
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
budgeted um and as I spoke with other
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
members that they could have a
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
contingency within that budget then they
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
did not need section three of the Bill
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
further comments representative
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman um I support
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
these two sections
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
um in this amendment and I'd like to
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
speak with regards to section two which
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
is the authority to pay debt so the
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
provisions under the section that it's
 
01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
really it's very important to as the
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor um explained to me in a
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
conversation yesterday
 
01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
that this is vital to the smaller mom
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
and pop
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
businesses for example he said that
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
provide hauling services for the Solid
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
Waste Management District and ontime
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
payments for these small businesses is
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
critical for them to maintain cash flow
 
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
and this proc and the Solid Waste
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
Management District they don't meet
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
regularly and my understanding is that
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
the one that's in my area the Sou heagan
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
um landfill District they don't meet
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
during the summer so this provision is
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
is vital and I would also um like to
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
explain that this process that's put
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
forward here by um members non-c
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously signing a manifest
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
that means that they are to go and
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
review the Manifest separately not at
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
the same time um and sign off enabling
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
the um Treasurer to be able to cut a
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
check to pay the bills this is the same
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
exact process that's allowed for school
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
boards and um select boards so I don't
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
really see a problem with this provi
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
provision and um additionally at every
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
meeting the Solid Waste Management
 
01:19:46.629 --> 01:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
District Treasurer does in fact give a
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
report to the committee so um there is
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
um transparency and oversight with
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
regards to um this process and finally I
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
would add that solid waste management
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
districts are in fact audited um every
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
year according to the
 
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%

representative
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman so um in
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
preparation for this executive session I
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
did review the bill I did speak with the
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and I also um took the
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reach out to Mr Bruce
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
canoer at the Dr he's the municipal
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
Bureau director and um as I stated
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
previously I had an extensive
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
conversation with him um I'm happy to
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
share um our discussion uh based on my
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
notes however Mr canoer is is here and
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
um if you would permit Mr chairman uh it
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
may be beneficial for him to speak to um
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
this um section three in particular I do
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
support this
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
generically I will say that um this is
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
the heart of the bill and um through our
 
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
conversation it was pointed out that why
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is so critical is there is a
 
01:23:43.229 --> 01:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
technicality in statute where it's been
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
determined that with respect to a Solid
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
Waste Management District chapter 32
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
colon 2 Under the municipal budget act
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
that it does not apply and so so my
 
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
understanding and Mr canoer can can
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
clarify that due to that fact presently
 
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
there there is no procedure
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
um available for solid waste management
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
districts so that's why this is is so
 
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
important um to to have this and I'll
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that if you would allow
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
particular

01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
I hesitate is there anything you can add
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
is yeah we're not going to go through
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
and do the questions I um maybe
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative Prower can just give us a
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
an executive version of her conversation
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
with you I I think the committee has
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much kind of determined where
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
we're headed so anyway go ahead R so um
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
then then I'll do the best that I can
 
01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.430 align:start position:0%
then then I'll do the best that I can
and

01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so with regards to section three um
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
as I said that it's much needed due to a
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
technicality and statute um pertaining
 
01:25:09.629 --> 01:25:09.639 align:start position:0%
to the municipal budget law particularly
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
32 col 2 application the issue at hand
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
is that it was originally thought that
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management districts um
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
would need to would fall this section
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
53 um would fall under the um Municipal
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
budget law application however a close
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
reading of that section and at the Dr
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
interpreted that this would not apply to
 
01:25:35.199 --> 01:25:49.390 align:start position:0%
interpreted that this would not apply to
a

01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
53-bp only and if you go and you read 32
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
colon 2 applic
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
a um again I will state I'm not going to
 
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
read the whole um section there but it
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
does say that
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
um it says including those created
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
53-bp their budget at an annual meeting
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
of their voters so with regards to a
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management District there's
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
no annual meeting of Voters because
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
they it's comprised of the
 
01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.430 align:start position:0%
they it's comprised of the
committee

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
um so the other part that I would um
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
like to speak to is that this section
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
three again why it's so important is
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
that it establishes a clear procedure in
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
the event um of an overe expenditure or
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
an emergency that requires an
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
expenditure and importantly it provides
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for accountability
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
um my understanding through conversation
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
now they would just go about and and and
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
and and I guess seek the money
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
and importantly the source of Revenue
 
01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
typically would be an unreserved fund
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
balance I think that's all I that I
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
have for that section thank
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
supporting amendment 10
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
54h and I agree with all the statements
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
that have been made by the previous
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none um I'll make mine
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
um I I will be against this section as I
 
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned before I
 
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
was for section one agnostic on two and
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
I'm dead set against three and for the
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
same reason I mentioned in the original
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
hearing and that is the use of the words
 
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh in line 21 of overe expenditures and
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
then at the end of it that line calling
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
using the word unusual circumstance I
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
think unusual circumstance is overly
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
broad um if it would have been emergency
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures and then utilizing some
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
sort of language in the main body of the
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
language of emergency I I would have
 
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
been for it but this is just just too
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
broad it opens up too much so I will not
 
01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.030 align:start position:0%
broad it opens up too much so I will not
support

01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
this further
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
comments representative Brown just to
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
clarify Mr chairman the uh reason why I
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
object to section three is and and the
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
items in section four regarding the
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
contingency there's nothing that
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
prevents the uh the district from having
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
contingency funds to do this already
 
01:28:47.639 --> 01:28:48.629 align:start position:0%
contingency funds to do this already
thank

01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
you further comments represent
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
stavis yeah I would just say that there
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
is plenty of accountability worked into
 
01:28:58.159 --> 01:28:59.830 align:start position:0%
is plenty of accountability worked into
this

01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.629 align:start position:0%
this
amendment

01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:29:05.109 --> 01:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
um they cannot make these mer emergency
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures or ere expend while first
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
appealing to the governing bodies of the
 
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
member municipalities for a commensurate
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment the commissioner of Revenue
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
Administration has to accept an approve
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
any such
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
application um and the commissioner of
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh is free to disapprove any
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
expenditure unless the governing body
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
designates the source of Revenue to be
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
used so I just I I there's
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
accountability throughout this bill that
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
um I just don't see any holes in it
 
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I will support it further
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%

especially to the smaller towns in the
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%

01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh this bill provides guidance and
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%

02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
move on to pass as amended on House Bill
 
02:03:37.709 --> 02:03:37.719 align:start position:0%
1223 we have a
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
seconds okay further comments anybody
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
speak on
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
this I will represent K yeah I'll be um
 
02:03:59.470 --> 02:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna be voting voting no on the
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
bill I I just personally believe that
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
this bill should have been seen by by
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
another committee and I just want that
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
on the on the record thank you
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative State uh power thank you
 
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um this was a very difficult
 
02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
um bill for me and a vote while I
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
um would support the notion of an
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation for municipalities
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
to be able to make this um particular
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
decision my concern is that Municipal
 
02:04:33.629 --> 02:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
and County government while this is
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
enabling statute and that's we are
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with that um in terms of um
 
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
gambling games of chance this is not
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
these types of bills don't come to this
 
02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
committee therefore I don't feel that we
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
are properly equipped to make the best
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
decision with regarding with regards to
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
this bill and in fact it should have
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
gone to a different committee because to
 
02:05:00.669 --> 02:05:00.679 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge this is my
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
second term such um bills with regards
 
02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
to games of chance like I said don't
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
come here so I'm very uncomfortable um
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I I I just lack the the bigger
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
picture as to how this fits in and the
 
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
different parts and pieces to um
 
02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
currently what's in statute and what
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
different bills that have passed so um
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult but I will um I
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
would like to see this perhaps filed
 
02:05:36.549 --> 02:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
again um next year and um it go to the
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
proper committee thank
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
you rep representative
 
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
yella yes thank you um one thing that I
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
had not previously mentioned in the
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
committee is that we're changing the
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
default status of
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
um allowability of these um
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
establishments from um from allowed to
 
02:06:01.629 --> 02:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
not allowed unless specifically stated
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're also um specic uh and that is also
 
02:06:09.149 --> 02:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
changing not only slot machines it's
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
changing um the uh card games or any
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
other like the charity ones all of them
 
02:06:20.189 --> 02:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be specifically allowed
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
first before they would be able to
 
02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:22.910 align:start position:0%
first before they would be able to
continue

02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
their um uh operations after this
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh goes into effect and so um it's we
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have any any people you know
 
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
testifying about that fact and there is
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
just you know a myriad of issues that
 
02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
have not been fully vetted out by this
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
rushed process uh and so for that reason
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
among others um I urge you to vote
 
02:06:57.549 --> 02:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
against this representative
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
priest uh thank you Mr chairman I will
 
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
be supporting the UT to pass the motion
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
because gambling is now legals since
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
2021 and I think anything that the local
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
communities can do to prevent it from
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
going into their boundaries is in this
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
bill and I think that should be given a
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
priority thank you forther
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
majori thank you Mr chairman and given
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
that the moratorium is is going to be
 
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
expiring here giving uh municipalities
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
the chance to say yes or no giving them
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
the voice in that discussion giving them
 
02:07:44.470 --> 02:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
that ability to make that decision that
 
02:07:49.069 --> 02:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
is best for them uh gives me reason to
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of this bill although I do
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
want to say yeah I don't either I I
 
02:07:56.430 --> 02:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
agree I don't like that this came to us
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
because this ain't us but given that we
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
have it and we seem to we have a
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
timeline I can uh after doing some
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
homework and speaking with people
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
certainly support the bill as amended
 
02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:11.350 align:start position:0%
certainly support the bill as amended
thank

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
you uh representative yell yeah I just
 
02:08:17.549 --> 02:08:17.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to the claim that
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
gambling was allowed in 2021 it was
 
02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.990 align:start position:0%
gambling was allowed in 2021 it was
allowed

02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
in the state far before
 
02:08:26.669 --> 02:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
2021 um I think you're referencing
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
specifically horse horse uh the horse
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
racing um Bill and that is not what is
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill this is far more
 
02:08:41.709 --> 02:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
and uh and has been longstanding you
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
know the the card rooms throughout the
 
02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
state all of those things gambling has
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
been allowed you know for for much
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
longer than that and this seeks to
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
change that long longstanding um uh
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
situation uh in relationship between the
 
02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:02.559 align:start position:0%
law and and municipalities that has been
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
um existing for uh a long time and doing
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
it in a h halfhazard way is
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate thank you representative
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair um I just like
 
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
to follow up on a couple of uh comments
 
02:09:22.350 --> 02:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
that were made um I uh agree that
 
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
another committee should have heard this
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
um maybe us and another committee um
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
because this is talking about because
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
it's proposing a local option that's a
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
local government and that's municipal
 
02:09:38.910 --> 02:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
government uh and so that is why part of
 
02:09:42.270 --> 02:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
why I think we saw this um and I had
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
another point which is not oh and we
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
have seen um historic horse racing and
 
02:09:50.109 --> 02:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
and uh charitable gaming bills here
 
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
before so
 
02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
questions um I'll make a quick comment
 
02:10:01.549 --> 02:10:01.559 align:start position:0%
we've heard several uh speakers talk
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
about whether it came to our committee I
 
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
would totally agree with representative
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
Gilman's last comment about it is a
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
municipal and County uh issue in some
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
respects I will also say state that in
 
02:10:16.270 --> 02:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
order for this to have come to the this
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
committee it required the approval of
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house which I did
 
02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:22.109 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house which I did
receive

02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
receive
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
um the other issue
 
02:10:29.310 --> 02:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
is we needed a bill that was not going
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
forward to do a complete replacement on
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that was hp1
 
02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
1223 people probably don't remember but
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
the the uh sponsor didn't show so this
 
02:10:41.470 --> 02:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
was a bill that was going to get killed
 
02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
so this was a vehicle to allow this bill
 
02:10:47.629 --> 02:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
to go forward um the other uh comment
 
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
I'll make is
 
02:10:52.030 --> 02:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
um if and when it passes out of this
 
02:10:54.510 --> 02:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
committee this is the first hurdle a lot
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
more many more hurdles this is going to
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
have to go through it's going to go
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
first through the house floor then it's
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
going to go over to the senate committee
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
and it's going to go to the full
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
Senate if it makes it pass all that then
 
02:11:08.589 --> 02:11:08.599 align:start position:0%
you have the governor who still needs to
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
sign it so this is even if it comes out
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
of this committee with an OTP a is no
 
02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee at all that this is going to
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
make its way to the end so just want to
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
keep you on that representative
 
02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
don't I just got a general question when
 
02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
change uh I I don't know I'd have to go
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
