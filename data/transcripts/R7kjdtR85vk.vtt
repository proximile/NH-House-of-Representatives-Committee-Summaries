00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's quite frankly how could it be
 

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.230 align:start position:0%
that's quite frankly how could it be

was<00:42:29.200><c> well</c>

00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
was well
 

00:42:31.319 --> 00:42:34.150 align:start position:0%
was well
and<00:42:32.319><c> and</c><00:42:32.640><c> obviously</c><00:42:33.079><c> that's</c><00:42:33.240><c> one</c><00:42:33.400><c> of</c><00:42:33.640><c> my</c><00:42:33.880><c> big</c>

over there with their attorneys trying

00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
to figure out what are we gonna do now
 

00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:42.790 align:start position:0%
to figure out what are we gonna do now
now<00:42:39.599><c> that</c><00:42:40.440><c> well</c><00:42:41.160><c> we</c><00:42:41.240><c> don't</c><00:42:41.400><c> need</c><00:42:41.599><c> to</c><00:42:42.440><c> assume</c>

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
now that well we don't need to assume
 

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.069 align:start position:0%
now that well we don't need to assume
what<00:42:42.920><c> they're</c><00:42:43.160><c> doing</c><00:42:44.119><c> um</c><00:42:44.400><c> I</c><00:42:44.559><c> I</c><00:42:44.640><c> think</c><00:42:44.839><c> part</c><00:42:44.960><c> of</c>

00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
what they're doing um I I think part of
 

00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:46.670 align:start position:0%
what they're doing um I I think part of
the<00:42:45.200><c> reason</c><00:42:45.559><c> why</c><00:42:45.680><c> it</c><00:42:45.760><c> was</c><00:42:45.880><c> a</c><00:42:46.000><c> lot</c><00:42:46.160><c> easier</c><00:42:46.520><c> to</c>

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
the reason why it was a lot easier to
 

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.230 align:start position:0%
the reason why it was a lot easier to
hear<00:42:47.000><c> all</c><00:42:47.160><c> the</c><00:42:47.280><c> different</c><00:42:47.599><c> information</c><00:42:48.119><c> that</c>

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%

hear all the different information that
you<00:42:48.400><c> brought</c><00:42:48.680><c> is</c><00:42:48.920><c> because</c><00:42:49.200><c> there</c><00:42:49.319><c> were</c><00:42:49.480><c> less</c>

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
you brought is because there were less
 

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.589 align:start position:0%
you brought is because there were less
