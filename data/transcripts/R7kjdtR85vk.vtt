00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
good morning welcome to the special
 
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee on due process and
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
dcyf um I'd like to open up our meeting
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
and um and welcome everybody for coming
 
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
I know that we're a little thinner on
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
attendance today but um this is one of
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
the challenges of getting into the time
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
period that we're in in the house uh
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make sure that nothing
 
00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 align:start position:0%
else is missed in our bills that we're
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
working on and making Mak sure that they
 
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
all get through to the Finish Line um I
 
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
had hope that we would be able to have
 
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
some appointments with some of the
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
agencies however um some are yet not yet
 
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
ready to come um they are ready to
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
respond with some written answers others
 
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
have meetings that are scheduled right
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
now at the same time um so this may
 
00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 align:start position:0%
likely be a shorter meeting and the next
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
meeting um instead of setting a date and
 
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
hoping that we'll be able to get them in
 
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
um I will be working with them and then
 
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
working with the committee members so
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
that we can have have a meeting that's
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
scheduled when they are available um
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
also the house takes a break over the
 
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
summer so we won't be coming in I
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
believe is it July and August that we
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
don't come in correct so July and August
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
we will not be here um so hopefully we
 
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
can get some get some good things done
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
before that I know personally one of the
 
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
challenges that I've had is that there's
 
00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
not really sharp edges between what is
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
dcyf and what is in the family court so
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
I know that as I'm working through
 
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
something and trying to understand
 
00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
something a lot of times it ends up
 
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
being part of the family court issues
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
they actually have taken some topics
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
over to the special committee on Family
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
Court to address some of the concerns
 
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
that we've raised
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
um so um one of the interest one of the
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
big questions that you know as we do
 
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
this we'll be going through our
 
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
committee researchers pulled together
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
some fantastic research that I'm going
 
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
to distribute to the committee so that
 
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
we can have some um some better and more
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
productive meetings as we move forward
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly I I think that this is
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
important I think we we'll be continuing
 
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
on we'll be hearing from people as well
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
and um I wanted to see if anybody on the
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
committee had anything that they wanted
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
to bring up before we wanted to hear
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
from anybody that's here representative
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
long uh thank you madam chair the the um
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
pcyf Advisory Board is meeting uh next
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
Monday the 20th okay I I don't know if
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%

board thank you thank you just yes I
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
actually think that I'll come in sit in
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
and watch and see that because um
 
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
because dcyf is an area that i' only
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
been perer peripherally paying attention
 
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
to previously uh before being involved
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
with this I know that um I know that
 
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
it's a very very important topic but I'm
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
still learning a lot right now so I will
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
and is there anybody who'd like to speak
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
to the committee are you just here to
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
listen you'd like to speak yes okay um
 
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
do we have pink cards
 
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
sorry no I didn't take them thank you
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
yes yes I will put that on the committee
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
site yes and the other materials I'm
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
still I still need to make sure that
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
they're appropriately redacted so that
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
there's not personal information in them
 
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
um there's been very important
 
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
information but the last thing I want to
 
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
do is violate a family or child's
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
privacy um by accidentally putting
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
something out there that they'd rather
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
not have lived forever on the
 
00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:39.510 align:start position:0%
not have lived forever on the
internet

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
internet
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
yes it's a delicate balance you know and
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
that's what the challenge is too with uh
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf and and the concerns that we have
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
just making sure that families and
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
children are respected it's always it's
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
always a very delicate dance where
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
people um I believe we're always trying
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
to do the best they can but we're
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
humans okay
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
sorry and I guess procedure wise I
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been having a
 
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
conversation with unmik people in the
 
00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:07.029 align:start position:0%
conversation with unmik people in the
back

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you David um Killy or Kylie
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
Kylie Kylie David Kylie if you'd like to
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
speak and so we want to keep this
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
focused on policies not people um so
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
it's not about names it's about what
 
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.630 align:start position:0%
it's not about names it's about what
happened

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
and it's also about um not family court
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
because there's another sub another
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
special committee on that it's a focus
 
00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
here on DCF and the procedures within
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
DCF especially due process so with that
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
I'll stop interrupting and welcome you
 
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.470 align:start position:0%
I'll stop interrupting and welcome you
to

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
speak can you hear me okay yes thanks my
 
00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:23.959 align:start position:0%
name is David Kylie I am from ainson New
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um representing myself and
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
people and wrote this out so hopefully
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds as good as it came off my
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
fingers but uh each of the members on
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
the committee here today I imagine when
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's a public service due to an
 
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
obligation to a higher purpose whether
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
to correct Injustice improve the public
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
domain or perhaps just to make
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
government work better and protect our
 
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.750 align:start position:0%
government work better and protect our
private

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
rights uh which is the essential which
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
essentially is the is the purpose of
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
government keep in mind you're here
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
today at the request of the people not
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
those in some administrative
 
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
because people like me have witnessed
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
legislative tribunals endangering the
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
private lives of people I personally
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
don't have firsthand knowledge relative
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire DCF but I unfortunately
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
witnessed family loss as a result of its
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
sister franchises and two other states
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
on two separate occasions one only a
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
little over a month
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
ago the reason for my testimony today is
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
based on um witnessing and firsthand
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
knowledge of direct interference with
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
the people's right including my own
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
provide lawful instruction to
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
representatives in this house and even
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
members of this
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
committee the natural order of authority
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
flows from the mandates of their
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
creation just as an artist controls his
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
works or an inventor controls the ideas
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
his ideas or as I believe God controls
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
the time and space of our existence the
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
people create a government we told you
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
what the government has allowed and not
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
allowed to touch those mandates were
 
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
written out ahead of time organized into
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
into a document
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
and no one can no one can serve unless
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
they to agree to its terms mostly by
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
oath in turn the government creates its
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
agencies which are two ordinances below
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
its creators people over the past months
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
I've been told things really don't work
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
that way or you just don't understand
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
I've seen social media attacks relative
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.670 align:start position:0%
to this
committee

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
by PE on people by reps of our house
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
simply for stating what it's written
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
and labeling people like me as
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
right-wing nut jobs even making lious
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
accusations not on me personally about
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
being convicted felons scammers child
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
abusers accusing regular people of being
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
radicals or wanting to tear the system
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
down well since one is holding any agent
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
to any term of an agreement a radical
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
idea if you're not part of a system if
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
you're not part part of a system that
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
values political perspective in
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
sophistry over the simple words of an
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
agreement who is really the radical so
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps you don't feel like you can do
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
much perhaps you think you can only
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
write more laws and feel powerless to
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
punish those that break the laws we
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
already have
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps the general court has been
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
granted the Authority for for Grand
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
inquest as as well as the power to
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
impeach even for not showing up with
 
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
these hearings I would imagine I ask you
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
today to stop interfering with our right
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
to instruct focus on the truth
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
especially to that which has been sworn
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
according to the laws of the land and
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
quite simply constitute evidence when
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
unrebutted I ask also ask that if you
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
are part of or support the gaslighting
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's going on in the public space
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
please knock it off these are serious
 
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
issues that's it thank you thank you
 
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
very much and thanks for coming to this
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
committee there any
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
Gilbert good M good morning Madam chair
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives so many of you have seen
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
me before uh many of you have heard
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
Snippets here and there of the problems
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
and the tribulations and some of the
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
fixes that need to go
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
on so kind of to just break it down I'm
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
going to give a brief overlay of where
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
things are obviously there's a Great
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
Divide between some members of Our House
 
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.550 align:start position:0%
Divide between some members of Our House
of

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
Representatives you know and as some
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh spoke last week at
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
the uh meeting for on DCF that happened
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
you know sidebar in a sense um you know
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
they they said that we need more
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
immediate fixes and and I don't think
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
anybody's here saying that there's not a
 
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
problem that we don't need those fixes
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
immediately nobody's saying that you
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
know we can't work on those long-term
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know due process and you know
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
abolishment or or whatever be the case
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
but the situation currently is we have
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf and particularly two offices in our
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
state that just absolutely refuse to
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
follow policy procedures court orders
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
or even advice from the office of the
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
child advocate and the Attorney
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
um without naming them you know it's
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
known to this committee it's known to
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
many members that this is a
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
advisory so there's a stark reality that
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
we we can go ahead and act enact
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
whatever legislation we want
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
if if they're not following the
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that's on the books
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
currently what's going to make them
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
follow the legislation that we
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
enact so that's the real issue currently
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
is somebody needs to step in and start
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
holding these employees that refuse to
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
follow the court orders refuse to follow
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
the law held accountable uh and that's
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
just simply not happening and you know
 
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
when people are questioned on that they
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
jump ship you know as the most recent
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
director did as former director ripsom
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
did um if we go back to last year at the
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
family special committee on the family
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
courts um former ribom former director
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
ribom went ahead and testified the
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
biggest backlog for them is the criminal
 
00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:50.629 align:start position:0%
biggest backlog for them is the criminal
court

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
system and that's just one key aspect is
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
they refuse to do their duties while
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal case and that's where
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
half the aisle wants to focus is putting
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
everything on the criminal court case
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
and that's just simply not a possibility
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
at this point because the criminal side
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
of the justice system is slower than the
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
family court side of the justice system
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
um we just finished as some of you may
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
have been informed we just finished a
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
two and three4 year court case as my son
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
will put it that was closed out as
 
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
acquitted on all charges where for the
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
last two and three4 years I have not had
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
my and that's a problem that was that
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
was strictly on there was nothing
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
holding me except those criminal bail
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
conditions DCF had already closed their
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
case we had already resolved dcf's side
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
of things and it was the only the
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
criminal bail conditions that precluded
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
us from having contact so there there's
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
a problem with trying to just simply
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
abolish DCF and put it all to the the
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
criminal courts because the criminal
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
courts clearly are not ready and you
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
know the answers from the judges were
 
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
well co co you know we due process
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
rights don't matter because of covid you
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
right to a speedy trial doesn't matter
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
because of covid you're right to the
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
speedy trial doesn't matter because of
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
this or that you know so we won't get
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
into that too much but you know the
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
situation is is that backlog was all at
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
fault of the state we had three trials
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
that M ended in a mistrial at fault of
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
the state we had seven attempts at trial
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
in the last nearly three
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
years at fault of the state getting
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
postponed part of that was because DCF
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
was refusing to turn over records that
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
they still did not turn
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
over um that's a big issue that this
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
committee has obviously heard multiple
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
times over that DCF refuses to produce
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
evidence both in the family court and in
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
the criminal courts uh there was a
 
00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court hearing last year on
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
another case where one of the counties
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
had to drop the case because it the
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
superior court ordered that the DCF had
 
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
to turn over those records and the
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court upheld that and DCF still
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
refused to turn over those records so
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
they had to drop those criminal cases
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
because DCF did not want to turn over
 
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.549 align:start position:0%
because DCF did not want to turn over
those

00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
records so there there's a big issue
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
here with 170 g8a where they're willing
 
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
to turn over records to certain parties
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
and and refusing to turn over records to
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
defendants and to you know those
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
petitioned in the family courts uh we we
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
currently are still battling in the
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
Family Court um as some of you may know
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we're sitting waiting for records
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
and we got an email from the supervisor
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
saying well we don't want to give you
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
those records and we're waiting for a
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
court order to exclude you from having
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
those records well the problem is is
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
you're trying to say that there's a
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
problem here but then you're telling the
 
00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.350 align:start position:0%
problem here but then you're telling the
judge

00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
and the petitioned parent oh you can't
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
see what the problem is you can't see
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
the evidence that we
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
have so we're sitting in an issue
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
where you know they're saying oh we have
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
all this evidence all this evidence but
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
then they want to lock it away and hide
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
it away and not let anybody see it
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
including the
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
judges and in both family court and
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
criminal court so as you can imagine
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
some of you have seen some of the
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
reasons why in our particular case why
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
they're trying to hide that evence away
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
and I've spoken on that is the fact that
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
we had three children in our family
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
abused under DCF
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
supervision and that is confirmed 100%
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
by the Attorney General's office they're
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
still investigating both the DCF workers
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
and the individuals responsible for the
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
abuse and severe
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
neglect um so you can kind of see you
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
know when something goes Ary
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
they're just like don't look here don't
 
00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:02.549 align:start position:0%
they're just like don't look here don't
look

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
here um and that
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
was where our position is of where this
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
that criminal case even came from
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
because the whole time this County and
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
DC was solely focused on trying to cover
 
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
up what was going
 
00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:23.799 align:start position:0%
on on the other side of the aisle rather
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
than actually focus on my son the
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
criminal case was not focused on my son
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
it was focused on on just something
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
totally different which I won't you know
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
get too much into
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
publicly but at that same time three
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
months before that The Stepfather was
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
charged with criminal charges of child
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
pornography he was under investigation
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
for those sex crimes against these
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
children and I started speaking up about
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
it because they were still leaving my
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
child in that home they were still
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
leaving the other alleged victims in
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
that home with that alleged perpetrator
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
in violation of his criminal bail
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
conditions we had 169c protective orders
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
put in place for the children and DCF
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
was violating those 169c protective
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
orders for those children they not only
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
were violating it back then they
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
continued to violate it until November
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
of 2023 when the Attorney General's
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
office was investigating them for
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
perjury and investigating them for
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
violating those criminal bail conditions
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
and protective
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
orders so and and this is not not unique
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
to my family or my case or my children
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
or anything this is happening in a lot
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
of cases in those two district
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
offices and again the committee knows
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what offices those
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
are this is happening to many families
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely ridiculous I I don't
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
understand why these employees are still
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
they they have lawsuits against them for
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
other child fatalities I I just don't
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand I mean I understand because
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
obviously the state does not want to
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
terminate these employees and admit
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
fault for those child fatalities but why
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
we keep compounding the issues and
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
allowing them to continue to create more
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
severe issues for children and families
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
and for the state I I don't understand
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
why we're allowing them to be
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
involved um so that's kind of the the
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
backdrop of everything you know for the
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
last three years per se um the the real
 
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
kicker obviously like I said 17 G we
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that they're just turning
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
over record you know they have a problem
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
saying that oh we can't turn it over
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
because of third party or whatever well
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
the court orders say including third
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
parties like so we we're not going to
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know 170 g8a even says unless
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
there's a court order that says you can
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
turn over those third parties you know
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
and you know the courts are ordering for
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
those third party records to be turned
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
over and they're still saying well we
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
can't turn them
 
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.830 align:start position:0%
can't turn them
over

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so that's kind of the brunt of what I
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of say today I guess I
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean it's still a work in progress as
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
many of you can imagine
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
but you know that's and if you have any
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions that's where I'll leave it for
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
today I
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
think thank you representative
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
love thank you Mr Phil with you be
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
testimony where were where was it you
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
said you lived I live in Tilton Tilton
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
you I'm represent on thank you madam
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
chair so when did the case close the
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
criminal case okay so all right so the
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
DC that was a criminal case so the DCF
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
the DCF side of that Criminal Case
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
2021 and the criminal case for it was
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
repeat yeah so July of 2021 was when the
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf case closed as found uh so they've
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
closed it out as problem uh founded
 
00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.870 align:start position:0%
closed it out as problem uh founded
problem

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
resolved I still don't know how that
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
happens because they did not offer any
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
sort of services they did not even
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
interview me they did not give me my
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
parental Bill of Rights uh I can't talk
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
too much because there's still an a
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
appeal going on that um for that finding
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
but as you can imagine there's a problem
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
with them closing out as problem found
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh found a problem resolved when they
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
offered no Services they didn't even
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
come to my home I have other children in
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
the home they didn't even go ahead and
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
interview my other children to ensure
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
that they were safe so there's a huge
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
problem that I'm trying to drive home to
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
them that I will hopefully be able to
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
talk to soon about publicly that you
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
know there's a problem here you you
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
can't just say oh the problems are
 
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
solved check the box and and walk away
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
because not every parent is not abusive
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
like there are parents that are actually
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
abusive and actually neglectful that are
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
actually founded and whatnot we're not
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
just doing something maliciously to try
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
to circumvent something else like you
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything you didn't check on
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
that other child that's in the home what
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
is what if that actually was an abuseful
 
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.950 align:start position:0%
is what if that actually was an abuseful
situation

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that other child was being abused as
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
well you just let that child sit there
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
without being checked on so I have a lot
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
of problems with how they handled that
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
which I'm still trying to deal with
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
again like I said there's an open aaou
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
matter on that so I don't want to get
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
into too much details um but I hopefully
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
will'll be able to come back next month
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
because they're working on their
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
internal with their Administration and
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
Marine Nunan and the OCA on trying
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
to tidy up and figure out that yes there
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
is a problem Mr gilbertt and you know
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
let's sit down and actually work to fix
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
it thank you did you have a followup
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative than for taking my
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
question again uh how many children were
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
involved in uh you you said the some
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
were removed and some weren't uh could
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
you so so there is seven children
 
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
involved in the family this particular
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
incident there was only two children in
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
the home at the
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
time uh only three of those children are
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
actually my biological children and the
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
siblings can you explain that again sure
 
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
thing so I have I have three children
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
the two oldest children of the family
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
are 14 and 13 currently those are full
 
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
are 14 and 13 currently those are full
biological

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
biological
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
siblings the mother has another four
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
children after that that varying age and
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
then I have a third child who is 7 years
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
old who was in the home at the time of
 
00:26:57.919 --> 00:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
old who was in the home at the time of
that

00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
incident and again dcyf never checked up
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
on that child DCF never didn't that's
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
where my problem is with my appeal my
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
appeal isn't because they found it a
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
problem and because I I know how you
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately the system is they
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
just say oh yep we believe you know it's
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
by a preponderance of the evidence we
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
believe that the child was abused our
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
finding is and this is how we're going
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
to work to solu to fix it that's not
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
what they did they just went ahead and
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
said there's a problem Oh the problem's
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
all set
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
had Mr Gilbert charged
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
criminally maliciously um we'll get into
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
that another day but um because they
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
turned over evidence without a subpoena
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
warrant as well um in violation of 169c
 
00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
and their own
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank thank you for bringing this
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
to us again this and I'm so sorry for
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
everything that your family's gone
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
through with these challenges it's it
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like a really difficult situation
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm thankful that you found those
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
different resources because um I I I
 
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
guess the office of the child advocate
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
wasn't around when this began in 2021
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
because it's a more recent creation or
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
was it at that
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
point as a just start it was just
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
starting out
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
and I'll just say part of that was part
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
of our doing as well um our cases have
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
actually been going on since 2019
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
so and these investigations into the
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
other side of the family have been going
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
2018 so you found that the office of the
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
child advocate is one of the good
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
resources for families families to go to
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
and for children to go to in order to
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
have another perspective um and to be
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
able to Advocate although I'm sure it
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
has it short everybody has their
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
shortcoming so obviously they're a
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
little overburdened but they have made
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
an effort for the last last 15 months
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
almost 18 months I guess now to meet
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
with myself on a month at least a
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
monthly basis um they have provided
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
direction to DCF the Attorney General's
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
office has provided direction to
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
DCF that local office just simply does
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
direction thank you and the Attorney
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
General's office did they get involved
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
because of work from the um Office of
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
the child advocate K or from um a
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
different process or if you don't know
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
how they got involved so I would say
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of everything okay um
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
enough sign there yeah multiple people
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
filed perjury allegations last summer uh
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
I think I spoke on this last time I was
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
here and if not it was at one of the
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
other committee meetings last summer
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
last June one of the children was
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
sexually contacted by the adults in the
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
home and DCF left that child in the home
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then they went ahead and testified
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
in the Family Court saying that there
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
was no issues inside the home there was
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
no issues allowing these children to
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
have contact with this person in
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
violation of his bail conditions and his
 
00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.230 align:start position:0%
violation of his bail conditions and his
protective

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
protective
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
orders uh obviously we had another case
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
where Juvenile Justice went ahead and
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
told the court we had two cases one for
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice for my son uh there was
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
a chins case that was open because
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
subsequently um um so Juvenile Justice
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
went ahead and told the court what was
 
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:34.039 align:start position:0%
actually going on in the mother's home
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
and the truth about everything well the
 
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
cpsw side in that local office went in
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon and said everything was
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
fine and dandy there was no issues in
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
the home and that they were advocating
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
for contact with the stepfather who was
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
again still under criminal Veil
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
conditions for the child pornography
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
charges and he was still under
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
investigation for sexual abuse of these
 
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.149 align:start position:0%
investigation for sexual abuse of these
children

00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
they he's been under criminal
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
investigation since
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
2018 and those to my knowledge and from
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
speaking with the police department are
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
still active and open so we just don't
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
understand why dcf1 was violating the
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
bail conditions but again then
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
advocating in court saying it was
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
beneficial for these children to have
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
contact with this person in violation of
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
bail conditions and protective
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
orders and um that's why you are at the
 
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
aaou because there is an investigation
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
being done in order to make in order to
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
follow up and see what happened and why
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
that happened as a as a derivative of
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office getting
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
involved no so the aiou is the appeal of
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
the finding of abuse against myself for
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
that criminal case that just closed so
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
that a has been pending for two and
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
three quter years just about as well two
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
and a half years and again like I said
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
DCF closed it out as founded uh finding
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
with a problem resolved well they
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
offered me no Services they offered us
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
nothing they never did a home visit
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
excuse they refused to even connect with
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
me or even tell me what the problem was
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
that was the biggest issue of it um so
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's the basis of what my appeal is is
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
how are you going ahead and saying this
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
was problem resolved how did you even
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
come to this finding in the first place
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
when you refused to invest and tell the
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
alleged perpetrator what they allegedly
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
did you refuse to give parental Bill of
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
Rights you refuse to conduct a home
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
visit and ensure that the other child in
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
the home was even safe and secure so how
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
are you closing this out as problem
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
resolved when you didn't offer any
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
services and the situation I I I know
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
what the situation is because I've
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
talked with the office of the child
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
advocate and this happens in many cases
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
they were banking on that criminal
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
charge to end in a conviction so that
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
criminal aspect would take care of their
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
duties and alleviate them of the
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
problem the problem is is obviously that
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
didn't happen so now now they're sitting
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
down there well I guess we're down in
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
conquered right now but they're sitting
 
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
over there at the state complex
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
panicking trying to figure out what to
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
do because that criminal charge didn't
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
bail them out and there is a problem
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
resolved there's a lot of ongoing pieces
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
there I apologize for ting that part
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
wrong have you connected with the office
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
of the abund at DCF so that is a big
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
problem that we actually need to address
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
as well I feel I don't know how we go
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
about it so because there's an active AA
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
case the office of the ab budsman
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
refuses to connect with and that's in
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
statute well it's in admin rules um that
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
the office of the ab budsman is not
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to engage with a person or a
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
family who has an active aaou
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
case because
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh handles the administrative
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
Appeals Unit and obviously DHHS also
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
handles the ab budsman
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
office so they refuse I forget exactly
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
what uh admin rule it is but there is an
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
admin rule that
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
disallows the ab budsman office to
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
engage with parents that are in an act
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
Au thank you for providing that
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
information that's uh definitely
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
something to look into that that's seems
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
challenging to me do representative long
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
did you have a question or is it I I did
 
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
actually thank you uh throughout all
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
this will you Pro say what did you have
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
an attorney so in the family court I
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
have an attorney that obviously the
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
state has
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
provided obviously the criminal case the
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
state provides an attorney for the
 
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.790 align:start position:0%
state provides an attorney for the
criminal

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
case um everything else and in the aeou
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
I am proos say
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
and unfortunate for DCF I am
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
obliterating them in the Pro proceeding
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
of the aaou
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
but okay thank you so I I do feel that
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
that's an issue though um that the aaou
 
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:15.079 align:start position:0%
and I think that's one of those things
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
that you know that other side of you
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
know the iel keeps bringing up is with
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
these tribunals is that there is no
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
representation there is no facing your
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
accuser in those AA proceedings
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
I I do feel that that's something where
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
realistically if we're going to find a
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
problem and say there's a problem and
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
take a child way we should do it through
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
the family court rather than through the
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
aaou you know you're going to go ahead
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
and say there's a problem and put a
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
safety plan in place and say you can't
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
have contact with this
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
child and then give no representation
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
give no hearing on
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
it you know obviously that a you know
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
the protective order and whatnot not is
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
already closed out that safety plan is
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
closed out but that's how it starts is
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
they go ahead and open the case they put
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
a safety plan in place they say okay
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's an issue we need a safety
 
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
plan the safety plan's only good for you
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
know two weeks a month at the most
 
00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:19.190 align:start position:0%
know two weeks a month at the most
usually

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
and did you have a
 
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.390 align:start position:0%
and did you have a
question

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
oh sure thing so
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
um so yes so they open that up and then
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
they go ahead and finish up their case
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
assessment whatever it's supposed to be
 
00:36:40.309 --> 00:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
within 30 days um that usually does not
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
happen um
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
and once that finding is done that
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
protective order is closed
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
out well in this situation obviously the
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
criminal bail conditions precluded the
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
contact well those criminal bail
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
conditions are closed out and no longer
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I mean I went and had contact with
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
them the same day that the equid
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
happened so that there's a problem
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and I'm sorry for the
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
interruption uh what I need to sort out
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
um I I understand and I I I absolutely
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
think that perhaps we ought to um alert
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
the DCF advisory committee that about
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
the issue of release of records that
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
explored um but what I was trying to
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
figure out um it sounded to me like you
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
were saying that the aaou process was
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
involved in removal of children and my
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the aaou process
 
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.589 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the aaou process
is

00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
for the grievance the arises out of the
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
proceedings it's not the actual removal
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
and in fact there was no removal in this
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
case part of which is one of your
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
concerns is that correct have I got that
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah so I guess I didn't do the
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
the best job of explaining that
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a lot compated there
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
are a lot of moving parts so I just want
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure I
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
understand so where the gears are not
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
meshing so in theory if you follow the
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
procedures and how they're supposed to
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
happen they're still supposed to be
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
meeting with us on a monthly basis for
 
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
home visits while this AA is open
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be having a safety
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
plan in place while this aou is
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
happening they
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
don't you know that's a problem but the
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
thing is is so with that I guess it's
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
not that they're taking children with
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
the aou but they're taking your your
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
rights and liberties with that that
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
finding of abuse you know like right now
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's a finding of abuse well I can't
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
go work in a school I can't work in a
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
daycare I can't go work on a a bus you
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
there's many places I can't work in a
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
nursing home because of that finding of
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
abuse now I'm not saying every employer
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
goes ahead and checks the central
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
registry but they have the ability and
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
they have the legal right to check that
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
central registry for that finding of
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
abuse so there's a a problem there where
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
you know they're going ahead and saying
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's a problem they're going ahead
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
and saying oh the problem for this
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
particular Avenue so there's three
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
Avenues there's founded sent to court
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
there's founded problem resolved and
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
then there's
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
unfounded so the issue is the problem
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
resolved really is where the issue is
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
that that Avenue kind of just needs to
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
disappear and if they're going to find a
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
problem then it really needs to be sent
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
to family court
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
or you know because it's it's taking
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
away your Liberties to work I mean it's
 
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.190 align:start position:0%
away your Liberties to work I mean it's
not

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily taking your children from
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
you but if you have another allegation
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
of abuse they automatically open that
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
for an
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
assessment you know right rightfully so
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is is so they
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead and open that up they put a
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
safety plan they take your child away
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
for 30
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
days to decide what they're going to do
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
with the case that's still impactful for
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
the children I feel
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
anyways even for that 30
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
days thank you very much for
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
yes so yes and I'll have an additional
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
write up I mean I have a 300 page
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
article that will eventually go out
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
we've been working on it we had most of
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
it ready for the uh special committee on
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
the family court but because of obvious
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
reasons we kind of delayed on releasing
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
that and you know we will still delay a
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
little bit longer while this a is going
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then we'll get that out to everybody
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
so I would ask with that that you
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
include a summary 300 pages is a lot
 
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
there there will be a summary but for
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
the ambitious folks there are some there
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
will be some ambitious folks that will
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
want to dive in and understand exactly
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
pinpoint on how everything came to be
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
and how everything happened and how we
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
can actually fix
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
everything thank you representative long
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
um what the dcyf ADV committee um could
 
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
you also um ask about the conflict um
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
between not being able to have an aou
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
and um work with the umman at the same
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
time okay and um the question about the
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
founded resolved having no no court
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
involvement so no opportunity um for a
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
hearing representative
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
Weber and I would just add to that um
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
there there often is no court
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
involvement if it's if it's founded but
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
um resolved but it seems to me that if
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's founded and the person's accused
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
have not been told what was
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
found that would be an
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
issue yes I mean not being told what the
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
basis of the the issue
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
was is
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh very problematic if that if
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's quite frankly how could it be
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
resolved if don't know what the problem
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
was well
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
and and obviously that's one of my big
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
things that you know they're sitting
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
over there with their attorneys trying
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
to figure out what are we gonna do now
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
now that well we don't need to assume
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
what they're doing um I I think part of
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
the reason why it was a lot easier to
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
hear all the different information that
 
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
you brought is because there were less
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
of the names and just focusing on the
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
issues because um I do know that you
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
brought this to us but it's a lot more
 
00:42:59.069 --> 00:42:59.079 align:start position:0%
clear removing the names and removing
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
all of that because it's a lot more
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
obvious exactly what's going on with the
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
moving pieces so thank you for being
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
able to do that and bringing that to us
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
not a problem so thank you for having me
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions thank you
 
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:18.309 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions thank you
very

00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
much and uh there's one other topic that
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
I think is also very important for us to
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get our hands around
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
it um I know that the title core
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
especially sitting in on finance in
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
division three we had some discussions
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
about some of the title four funding and
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
those implications for some of the
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
policies that we're moving forward on um
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
I would like to have a better
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
understanding of title 4 its
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
interactions with
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
DCF um what it requires what it
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
prohibits and how it influences the
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
setup of DCF its interface with the
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
family court um to me since it's such a
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
complex issue my question um especially
 
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
to representative walner is if it would
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
make sense to um have in the budget
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
requests that they can outline and spe
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
specify when Title four is included
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
because I know that that has an impact
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
on what we would be funding and what we
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise would be funding so that we
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
can understand the implications um of of
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
forward well it's I think it's certainly
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
something we should maybe bring to the
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
attention of the legislative budget
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
assistant and as um the department is
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
getting ready to um put together its
 
00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.990 align:start position:0%
getting ready to um put together its
next

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
budget have the legislative budget
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
assistant maybe work with them around
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
what's possible as far as um deciding of
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
those those funds thank you um so with
 
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:40.839 align:start position:0%
that do you think it would make sense
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
for me to talk to Mr Ripple and get a
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
better idea of how to ask my questions
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
once once we get through this period
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
with the bills needing to be passed sure
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
you and are there any other questions or
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative love he I've
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
been uh thanks for taking my question or
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
my comments um I've been working with a
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
constituent um I believe I brought it up
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh she had uh her daughter had uh had
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
three kids taken away and adopted to a
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
family in
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
Florida they left one child the SM the
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
youngest child with them once again tell
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
me some rhy or Reason here the most
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
vulnerable they leave but they took the
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
the three older ones um you know it's
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh I can't I can't wrap my head
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
around it I I can't for for the life of
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
me figure out what's what's going on if
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
you if you're going to take three please
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
take the if there if there's reason to
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
take three please take the most
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
vulnerable the youngest one and uh and
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
they didn't um it it it just doesn't
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
make any sense to me and we' we've got
 
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
to figure out you know the the rhymes of
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
reasons why they do
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
things it it's I just keep hearing story
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
after story after Story things that
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
don't make sense thank you we'll put in
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
a request specifically for those
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures around how they
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
determine which children stay in and
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
which ones are removed yeah um so that
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
we can understand it because it seems
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
that that's not as unique yeah just it
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
seems like Mr Gilbert's story fed right
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
into it the same thing happened
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
point thank thank you all for your time
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
and attention um I I will make sure that
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
um I can try and schedule with the
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate or anybody
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
else who can come in and provide
 
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
information um it would be good to um I
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
I'll see who whom else I can also bring
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
instead of scheduling a meeting and then
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
hoping that they'll be able to attend um
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
I will reach out to them and then reach
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
out to the committee members um to
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
confirm availability so that we can
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
schedule so then we'll we'll schedule
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
that in an upcoming calendar and once
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
again in July and August the legislature
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
is off so hopefully we'll be able to do
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
this and get something done in June um
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
because I know that that is quickly
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
approaching so with that I will close
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
