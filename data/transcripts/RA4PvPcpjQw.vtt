the vice chair know a full day ahead of
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
time it's not really an overly big issue
 
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
with our committee but a lot of bills
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to pass out out with as many
 
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
people as we can so it was too late in
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
the day for me to uh pull a replacement
 
00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
I know John does a better job of that so
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%

session for uh House Bill 122 FN and
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
1510 uh for some of the uh members that
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
arrived just a little while ago uh we
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
had I had expected an amendment to come
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
through under my name on
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
122 uh but there's been a mixup at uh
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
with a drafting and that didn't come
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
over here this morning there's a new
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
procedure it goes upstairs comes down to
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
us and uh so what we are going to do is
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
we are going to open up um House Bill
 
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.350 align:start position:0%
we are going to open up um House Bill
1510

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
1510
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
first and um then we will will recess
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
out um our timing issue is that this
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill needs to come out of committee it's
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
an early Bill uh we're under a schedule
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
right now of noon so I suspect if I can
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
get this drafted brought back we'll
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
probably recess the do
 
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
presentation and uh exec the bill at
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
that time and if we're all fortunate
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
that'll happen by noon so I would like
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
to open up the executive session on
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
1510 establishing a commission to
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
identify barriers and two solutions for
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle sales and use and I
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
recognize recognize representative Boyd
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%

00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
by Boyd seconded by Mills to uh itl
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1510 we are are open for
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
would you like to discuss your motion
 
00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:02.919 align:start position:0%

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
rest of the representatives yeah I would
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
prefer you open it up to the rest of
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
representatives represent Mills um thank
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair once again first of all
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us accidentally it
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
should have gone to Science and Tech it
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
was never our perview for this second of
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
all we have
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
a we have pass we have acted on so many
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
bills on electric vehicles so far I
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
believe we have passed the one for our
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing commission that can easily
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
handle easily handle this as an assigned
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
task and uh for that reason I I don't
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
feel it's necessary at this time and
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
seconded the itl thank thank you um
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
further discussion uh
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
questions when you say commission I just
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
want to be clear before we vote is this
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
the the study commission that we P we
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
had a bill for House Bill 412 last year
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
and then we have 1631 this year I just
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that correct thank
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
you represent hner thank you Mr chairman
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
I uh would prefer that we go to an itl I
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
this commission isn't ready yet
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
given other actions taken by other
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
committees on EVS but I'm very concerned
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
about the negative image that this
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
conveys that
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
certainly it illustrates that one of the
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
barriers to
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
implementation is you know this this
 
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.590 align:start position:0%
implementation is you know this this
legislature

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
not taking up actions that would in fact
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
permit or allow or even encourage uh EV
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
sales charging stations
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
Etc the state certainly has a
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
role if only as an employee of people
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
who drive EVS to work it has potentially
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
other roles that we could play or at
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
least to get out of the way I think
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
there's a a long list of things that uh
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
should be looked at by somebody now I I
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
can you know I'm wary of having just
 
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.310 align:start position:0%
can you know I'm wary of having just
another

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
commission uh and particularly given how
 
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
long it takes to develop these things I
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
think that itl will allow us to focus
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
this more perhaps find an
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
existing group that can have its
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
assignment changed or even to identify
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
what the what the barriers are so that
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
we can develop more um forward-looking
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislation I think this is just going
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
to be seen as another sort of climate
 
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.789 align:start position:0%
to be seen as another sort of climate
change

00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:51.519 align:start position:0%
denying uh
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
anti-progress action if we do itl so
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
I and strongly urged we not do that and
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
that we in fact put us out for interim
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
study thank you representative uh
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative Pon
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
please oh sorry represent
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
vone uh thank you Mr chairman so I I
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
think you did clarify so you're you're
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
proposing an interim study as opposed to
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
itl is that that correct we have we have
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
a different motion on the floor so I
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
would propose itl if this one fails all
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
right thanks further yes represent vo uh
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I just want to
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
not getting a a ping pong with my with
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
with my good friend representative
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
vulner but what I would say from from
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony that fire marshall
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
Toney talked to about the science on
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
lithiums have been changing and coming
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
and um some of the things having served
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
locally in my community some of the the
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
challenges that my fire chiefs have
 
00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:52.039 align:start position:0%
experienced in dealing with with traffic
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
accidents as it as it relates to to Li
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries maybe you know once
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
small snippet of of of of the larger
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
picture of how EVS are going to have an
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
impact in our society but the larger
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
thing that I looked at is several months
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
ago and I know General Motors is one and
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to throw out another
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
Corporation and be held in contempt but
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
I know that there was at least three
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
Motor companies that were scaling back
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
their electric vehicle production um
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
forecast for this particular year and
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
next the next particular year which I I
 
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
think cuts into the testimony that uh M
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
Willcox from D has provided as it
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
relates to the iso forecast so um I'm
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
not I'm not a denier I think I think
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are here to stay I
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
think they are a part of the I think
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
they are a part of the future um but how
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
we choose to um
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
address what we do as a state as it
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
relates to to EVS I I actually think
 
00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
that s
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
sp430 um is is doing that I think think
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
is having that conversation and then if
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
there's a need to have a larger
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
conversation we can build off of that so
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
uh I I would prefer I would I want I
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
want to try and look at this
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
incrementally um which is why I think
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
itl is is the right motion at this at
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
this particular stage of the game
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
further further yes please say I think
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
that everything you said and certainly
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
respect a relationship and we can
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
disagree on some things and that but I
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
think the words that you say in fact
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
argue for itl but you know there's a
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
pause here in some manufacturers not not
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
all that may give us some time to figure
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
out what it is moving forward you know
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
that there's another commission that may
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
be looking at this that's another reason
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
to pause and not to kill it uh so I you
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
know I certainly understand
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
the the hesitancy of people to jump in
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
feet first or head first
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
but that's what this you know that's
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the proposal for interim
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
study is all about and even the proposal
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
for a commission was all about so I just
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh I just think that the itl is just a
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
negative stop doing what we're doing so
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
that's my concern okay further
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
discussion yes please thank you chairman
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh I think interim study would and and
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps interim study and then folding
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
into something existing would help with
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
um charging infrastructure looking at
 
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
the charging infrastructure how that
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
impacts both tourism and commerce and uh
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
commuting commuting to work uh in
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
addition um represent J the mo the
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
motion is itl we'll speak on the motion
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
so yeah the I fully understand the
 
00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
comment thank you y any any yes please
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
repr chinski yeah I support itl and um I
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
think the best commission that we have
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
is right out there now it's the consumer
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
and the consumer votes every day with
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
their pocketbook they they choose the
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
best products out there whether it's TVs
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
computers cars so I got no problem with
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles but they're already
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
highly subsidized I don't know what more
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
you can do but let the consumer pick
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
them out and then hopefully
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturers will give them exactly
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
what they want and they'll be happy to
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
buy it and I just wonder why we even got
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
to get involved with that thank you
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any further comment
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
please uh represent
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia yeah you
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
know we're at least four or five years
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
away from any kind of thank you
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
Improvement in uh electric
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh like Mr kazinski said the
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
public has spoken 75% of all the
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles made so far are
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
sitting in
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
Lots uh there's a reason for that
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
dangers uh we're going to have to deal
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
with the the weight problem of the
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles at some point in time on our
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
roads and our bridges and uh our parking
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
garages uh there just I just think we're
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
stepping into this way too soon I think
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
we need a three or four year break
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
before we do and see what
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
transpires in the meantime to make these
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
Vehicles more safe and more readily
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
available thank you yes represent
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
Pon so I'd like to continue to the
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
conversation about interim study I'm
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
just looking uh projections for electric
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle sales um okay Bloomberg says
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle Market looks headed for
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
22% growth this
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
year uh NASDAQ EV trends for
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
2024 continued growth uh expected to
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
continue growing in 2024 and as
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
following another year in 2023 so
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
electric so I
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
think there is something to uh this
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
bill it's not ready for prime time I
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
certainly agree on that and but I would
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
like to agree to the point that just it
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
Ling the bill sends a message that this
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
state is hostile to electric vehicles
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
and it's growing that perhaps the state
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
has a role in planning on how this
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
growth is going to be
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
managed and so that this could be done
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
but again looking at what we already
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
have in place interim study is a great
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
way to okay we're that and and I
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate all of your opinion
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
but let's let's focus on the itl motion
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
it would appear you're not in favor of
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
itl that is correct thank you very much
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and I apologize for the wrong
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
name they representive represent clud
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
here uh yes um it is going to be I've
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
really struggled L with this bill and
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
I've talked with the sponsor about it
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I heard her
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
presentation and I just want to say that
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes for a vote and I'm at the
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
first one I will vote against the itl
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
motion with all due respect to everybody
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
who's on the other side I don't think
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's a real partisan issue I if itl goes
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh approved I will support the committee
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
on the floor and hope that the uh the
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
commission and or the 10e plan can do
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
anything but I just think we need to do
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
more to promote electric
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh and I think to me this
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
commission at least can identify and see
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
if we can do anything so with reluctance
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
I will vote no on itl and if it itl was
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
somehow fail support interm study thank
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you I feel strong
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you some on the on the U
 
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.630 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you some on the on the U
itl

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
motion okay yes please um
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
R SAR please uh thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is is that I
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
heard at the beginning being said that
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
some of this topic of this particular
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
commission would be taken up in another
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
commission as long as I get a it's
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
commitment that that's going to happen
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
then I'd be willing to vote for the itl
 
00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
then I'd be willing to vote for the itl
thank

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
you yes representative yes I I I was and
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
once again I probably get the number on
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
was is it Bill 1631 CH yeah that's that
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
we have had a commission to study this
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
at least 10 years every 10 every two
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
years the players change everything
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
changed and they have to start from zero
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
last year I was fortunate enough to be
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
put on that committee and one of the
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
first things we realized is that it's
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's a broad scope number one it's
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
going to take some time and by changing
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
People every two years it accomplishes
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
next to nothing so our intent with this
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
new bill is to get the commission up and
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
running and then make it part of a
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of Public Works and
 
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
highways so that it will always be in
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
this room and as we we've solve various
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
facets how do we tax them H how how do
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
you how how do you charge them where do
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
we put charge as we solve individual
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
issues it was always the intent that
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
public works and highways Drive ding
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
that bus would put out the individual
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
bills so that we weren't having bills
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly that contradicted each other
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
you know they said you have to do it
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
this way and then oh by the way we
 
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
figured out another new way that was the
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
intent and that's why I put forth the
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
itl motion just that we don't need
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
conflicting commissions and that this
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
would be the purview of the new
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
semi-permanent commission thank you any
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
discussion I think we've had
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
um a good conversation uh seeing none I
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
I am going to vote
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
itl um prior to calling the the vote I I
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
I'm still struck by the testimony that
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
the batteries uh and the fire Marshall's
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and I I believe there's a lot
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
of work that needs to be happened I'm
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to key back to the point that
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
represent Mills said
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
the discussion on um on particulates in
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
the in the air and so forth I don't
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
think is something typically we cover in
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
this committee it was originally
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
assigned to uh Science and Technology I
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
will I will take the representative as
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
as Point as being a member of the
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh commission and there is
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
nothing that says that we can't handle a
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
a committee in our inside a study
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
committee inside side um if um If This
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
Were to pass so that we keep this
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
conversation alive and I would be
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:10.319 align:start position:0%

oldenberg he's the director of project
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
development who oversees the development
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year plan every two years for
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
the Department I just wanted to give a
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
very brief introduction before uh
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
turning it over to bill for the
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
presentation um I see some new faces and
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
there some experienced faces with the
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
10-year plan so um just for a very high
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
level summary the the 10year plan is is
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
the state's um you know Transportation
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan for the next for the
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
next 10 years it is updated every two
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
years um and uh we have we roll it out
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
two more years so it always covers a 10e
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
a 10year span and I uh want to emphasize
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
that it is a transportation plan because
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
it does contain all modes of
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
transportation uh a lot of our
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
presentation is going to be focused on
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh the highway and bridge program
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
primarily because that is the largest
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
piece of the program um and it is the
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
area where we probably have the most
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
discretion but I do want to emphasize
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
that all of the federal funding all of
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
the funding for all the modes of
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
transportation that we receive and that
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
come through the department are
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
contained in the 10year plan so the
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics and the airport um uh
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
programs are contained in the 10year
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
plan all of the um all of the uh funding
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
and the programs for uh public
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
transportation and uh Railway are in the
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
10e plan as well too um bill will give a
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
a higher level overview of some of the
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
breakdown and pie charts of that but uh
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
um I did want to make sure I emphasize
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
that this is a uh full Transportation
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
plan while we have a lot of discussion
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
about the highway and bridge program it
 
00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
does represent all modes of
 
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
transportation in the state um two years
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
ago when we updated the uh 10 a plan
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
before this commission there was a lot
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
of focus on uh recently passed Federal
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
authorization the bipartisan
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law or or the um the iig
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
which was our federal reauthorization
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
for the next uh six years at that that
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
point and uh when we were here uh two
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
years ago um that bill that
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
reauthorization had just been passed so
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of highlevel information
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
about the additional levels of funding
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
and and stuff but um how it was fully
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
implemented was still kind of kind of
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
being worked on so uh a lot of the
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
presentation two years ago was focused
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
on the amount of federal funding and
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
stuff that came from the
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
iiga this 10-year plan really focuses on
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
on the implementation of of that plan
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
and the delivery of the iig so we have a
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of uh look back but mainly
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
it's um very status very
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
um um you know sustainable in terms of
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing in terms of
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
implementing that uh program so some of
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
the updates through this plan have been
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
looked at uh uh adjusting everything for
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
inflation and taking a fresh look at
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
estimates um we have looked at
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
incorporating the next two years of
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
regional Planning commiss Commission
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
priority ities um there is a strong
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
focus on the additional Federal funding
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
that we're providing to Municipal
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
Bridges um and uh a number of the
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
programs and um and other elements one
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
thing at this this this round of um the
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
10-year plan was the solicitation for uh
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
a a certain flavor of federal funding
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
for the congestion mitigation and air
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
quality program um um uh and that had a
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion and debate we'll
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
discuss some of those changes but um
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
that that was an element of this ten
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
year plan as well too so without further
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
Ado I just wanted to give that brief
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
over over overview of where we are and
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
what what the 10year plan is uh and with
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
that I'll turn it over to uh uh Bill
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
oldenberg director of project
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
development to walk you through the
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
presentation that uh that we have and
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
again it is fairly high level there is a
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
information um we want to give you a a
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
flavor and hit the high points but
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
certainly through this or the public
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
hearing of the subsequent work sessions
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
want to work with the committee uh and
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
make sure you understand and get all of
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
your questions um uh satisfactorily
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
addressed so
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you commissioner um I
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
recognize it um you're you're sort of
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
under a time crunch so I've reduced my
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
4-Hour presentation to about half hour
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
45 minutes so um and it it it has
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
actually pretty diff a little 10-year
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
plan humor it's not a very humorous
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
topic but um it it is the culmination of
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
a a year and a half's worth of work so
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
far and uh we sort of see a light at the
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
end of the tunnel um so just last week
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
um just sort of the handouts that we
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
gave you last week and what we just put
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
on your in front of you so uh last week
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
you should have received a 10-year plan
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
book um that inside that was the
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
transmittal letter from the governor uh
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
to the um house Public Works um uh on uh
 
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
that transmitt there was also a change
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
log of changes that had occurred during
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the gaset process and through the
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
governor's phase um a listing of uh the
 
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
CAC project summaries as well as a
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
corridor study map so in front of you
 
00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
today uh is a copy of the presentation
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'll be going over um and a a series of
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
maps to help you understand some of the
 
00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:30.799 align:start position:0%
some of the different aspects of of our
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
transportation system uh one is a a
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
federal aid map which shows you the
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
different tiers of roads and and those
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
roads which are ferally eligible uh
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
versus those that aren't federally
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
eligible and we'll we'll talk about what
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
that means in a little bit uh We've
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
included a map of the turnpike system
 
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
the transit system public airports um
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
the active Rail lines and we have
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
revived Ed the corridor plan the map
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we gave you last week because we
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
realized we printed an old copy and was
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
missing a corridor so U please discard
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
the the one we gave you last week and
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
also we found an error in the change one
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the change logs so we gave you a new
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
change log so um on the on the gaset
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
face so with
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
that um I will begin the presentation
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
covers a a a sort of flows from a recap
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
of the tenure plan process talk about
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
highlevel funding overview the 10-year
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
plan strategies that we used um in in
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
investing in in the assets and how we've
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh used and and uh plan to expend the
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
funds um and then I talk we talk about
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
the federal and state programs um that
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
we um use to and invest in so on slide
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
three what I'll try to do is I'll
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
remember to tell you what page I'm on uh
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
to keep you going so on slide three this
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
is an overview uh flow of of the 10-year
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
plan process so this process started in
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
the summer of 22 where we reach out to
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
the regional planning commissions to get
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
um a community and and and Regional uh
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
priorities um those are reviewed and uh
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh voted ranked by the
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
communities and brought into the draft
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
10year plan uh in april-ish and May um
 
00:53:25.799 --> 00:53:26.549 align:start position:0%
10year plan uh in april-ish and May um
of

00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
23 so this started uh a year and a half
 
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
ago last year we worked to the regional
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
planning commissions to bring those
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
projects forward um in June through
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
October we began uh the gaset phase uh
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
which is the governor's advisory
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
Commission on Intermodal Transportation
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
it's the five executive counselors and
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner um we review uh the the
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
plan the strategy the funding with them
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh discuss the approach that we're
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
taking in this 10-year plan and then um
 
00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
we hold the the gas uh group hold uh
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
public hearings to gather input on the
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
projects on the on the plan um and then
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
those are reviewed uh changes are
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
recommended through by gaset and then
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
that is ultimately uh transmitted to the
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
governor um for his review and comment
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
that was done in December and uh the
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
governor then reviewed commented main
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
changes that are shown in the in the
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
change log um and that was transmitted
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
in January 10th to be exact um uh to the
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislature uh to begin this process so
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
on page four and five we sort of
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
summarized the dates um that we held
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
these meetings that we that we did the
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
reviews um I won't I won't belabor with
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
you with reading them all I think the
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
the key one uh is from uh September 7th
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
to October 25th we held uh 24 Public
 
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
hearings um to review the tenear plan
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.630 align:start position:0%
throughout the
state

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
um and um on slide six there is a
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
summary of that public
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
testimony um we held like I said 24
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
Public hearings there were seven hybrid
 
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
hearings um the public testimony uh is
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
663 pages long uh summarizes every
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
meeting who attended what the comments
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
were um so if you if you want to there
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's available online um on in the
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
10year plan on on Do's web page um to
 
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
apprise those to see what those comments
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
were to summarize um
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
briefly we we heard a lot of support for
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
Transit uh we had a lot of um input um
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh and testimony from the mobility
 
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
Managers from the transit agencies and
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
from the public um that supported um
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
Transit uh expansion of Transit and also
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
supported and we're thankful and
 
00:56:12.029 --> 00:56:12.039 align:start position:0%
appreciative of the additional money
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
that was passed in hb2 um uh last last
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
um budget cycle uh for additional funds
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
to support the transit system on the
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
project side we heard a lot of report on
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
the Newcastle Causeway project
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
um from a an Outreach and a a Ruckus
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh there was a lot of uh
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
comments about the a couple Tilton
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
projects that we had um and also the
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester exit 6 and s project um uh
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
also got a lot of lot of uh concern and
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions so um we've addressed those um
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
all of those projects you can see in the
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
change log uh were addressed and and
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
through the gaset process and uh in that
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
so I'll talk about those projects in a
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
little bit so on on page seven and eight
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the presentation what I want to do is
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
highlight a little bit of what's in this
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
book so um the information that's in
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
this book uh and and how to read it and
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
the first few pages you'll see a lot of
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
charts and graphs it's basically how we
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
slice and dice uh the funding we
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
received the different buckets that the
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
funding comes in um some of it's
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
mandated funding some of it's Federal
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
funding the state the turnpike funding
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so it it lists the funding that um
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
that comes in it also lists the the the
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
investment strategies and how that that
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
funding is spent and the different modes
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
um Etc so you'll see a lot of
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
information on on uh money in and and
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
money out um in those in the in the
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
graphs and how that's spent the
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
remaining 274 Pages um are project Pages
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh an example is on page eight so each
 
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:09.039 align:start position:0%
project in the 10-year plan uh has a
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
specific project it's they're they're
 
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
they're listed by Town
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
name uh list the road the description of
 
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
what the project is and it also breaks
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
out uh the different phases of our
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
project so there's basically three
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
phases a design phase a rightaway phase
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
and a construction phase and you'll see
 
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:31.039 align:start position:0%
that listed as preliminary engineering
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's basically the design uh RightWay
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
if we need to acquire any RightWay like
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
easements or or or Acquisitions of of of
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
property um that's where that is the the
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
funding and the years are shown and the
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
construction so the years represent when
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
we would start um those
 
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
activities and then the funding
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
represents the amount of money and then
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
also we list the program um that the the
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
the funding is is coming out of um
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's also some other information that
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
is listed is in the comments you'll see
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
where that project came from this
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
project is the example came through um
 
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh statford Regional Planning Commission
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh through the 10-year plan process back
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
in uh 2023 so gives you an example of of
 
00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:21.559 align:start position:0%
what that information is for all these
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
projects um in the in the back the last
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
Pages you'll see a bunch of projects
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
that are listed as programmatics so what
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
those programmatics
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
are um we we bucket funding for projects
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
um for for programs or types of of
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
projects that we want to do um to set
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
aside money as placeholder but we don't
 
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
have actual projects yet so an example
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
of that is um maybe our our our highway
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
safety Improvement program we get $12
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
million a year uh in that in that
 
01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
program we don't know exactly um what
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
projects we'll be working on in the
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
outer years of the plan so we set aside
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
that $12
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
million and then as projects are created
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
sort of like a ledger in a a checkbook
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
we create a project that money is
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
reduced from the $12 million and that
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
project is created so you'll see these
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
programmatics listed that um are really
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
placeholders uh to make sure that we we
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
spend the money in those programs um and
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
and not spend it elsewhere um as
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
projects are created we we we then
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
reduce that amount so uh if you look
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the in the beginning years
 
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
the the numbers might look a little low
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
in the outer years they're they're very
 
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
consistent and that's why we've created
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
projects in this in the near future uh
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
to use those funds so um I
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's we do a great deal of our
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance and preservation this way
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
our Paving programs our Bridge
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance our our Bridge Replacements
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
um that that is how we we bucket our
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
money we don't know 10 years from now
 
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
what road we're going to pave but we
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we have money to
 
01:01:21.029 --> 01:01:21.039 align:start position:0%
pave those roads so that is why we we
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
sort of bucket the the money in and and
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
show it as a a programmatic um so
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
probably a longer
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
convoluted uh answer to that but uh on
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
on page nine uh talking about the
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
funding and where the where the funding
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
comes from the total program is 5
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
billion do over uh 10 years so about
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
$500 million per year Federal Highway
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
funding is the largest share of that at
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
about $280 million a year or 56% of the
 
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.950 align:start position:0%
about $280 million a year or 56% of the
program

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
there are other federal funds that we
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
get as the commissioner says we're not
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
just a a highway and bridge program we
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
also get um uh rail funds from federal
 
01:02:04.839 --> 01:02:05.789 align:start position:0%
also get um uh rail funds from federal
rail

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:05.799 align:start position:0%
rail
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
Administration uh Federal Transit funds
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh Federal Aviation funds for airports
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
that funding represents about 15% of the
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
program about $76 million per year we'll
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
talk about those specific programs in a
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
little bit we also on the state side we
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
have Turnpike programs that represent um
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
about 16% of the funds and that
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
represents um our our Turnpike renewal
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
and replacement program our maintenance
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
program then our capital projects then
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
we also have state funding through
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
betterment uh state aid Bridge uh and SB
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
367 that represents about 12% of the
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
funds uh $60 million per year and we'll
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
talk about a little bit of how this
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
breaks down um on in the next couple
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
slides but you can see that from a
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
federal standpoint um Federal Highway
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
makes up the majority of the funds that
 
01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.670 align:start position:0%
makes up the majority of the funds that
we

01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
receive on on page 10 we wanted want to
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
summarize a little bit you know the
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
roads um and the different tiers uh of
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
roads that we've created so not all
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
roads in New Hampshire or any state are
 
01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
created the same and we've broken the
 
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
the different cheers or different roads
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
into into tier so a tier one road is
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
basically an interstate or divided
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
highway down to a tier four road which
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
is a secondary Highway um unnumbered
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
State Route
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
so 4600 miles of roads that
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
sorry okay excuse me Mr oldenberg are
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
you open to questions I have a Committee
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
Member who wants to ask I don't mean to
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
interrupt or would rather
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
wait or just I I can answer questions
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
now or we can wait until the end that's
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
okay would you want to wait or want to
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
ask now
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
represent the question is is pertaining
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
to this page so okay it might make sense
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh am I correct
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
we we have the formal definition class
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
one through six roads these tiers it
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
seems like are an administrative thing
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
that the do does that really doesn't
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
have doesn't have any legal effect
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
beyond the class one through am I
 
01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
correct on that it's not defined in
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
statured anywhere correct correct this
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
is a sort sort of a self-imposed system
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
so if you went to the class system you
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
know the class 1 through six really the
 
01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
state roads are class one and two um so
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
what we've done is we've broken those
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
roads down a little bit further um a
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
tier one road being an interstate a tier
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
2 Road being a a a major um Statewide
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
Corridor like Route 16 or route nine um
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
and then the tier four or tier three and
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
four roads are those those minor roads
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh secondary roads and you know we I
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
affectionately call the tier four roads
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
is state roads that you wouldn't really
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
realize were state roads and we question
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
somebody the state roads they they they
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
go through a community or a town and end
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
in that town and don't really have a
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
regional significance but they are a
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
state road um and why I really wanted to
 
01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
talk about that was this this comes into
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
um the federal eligibility um a lot of
 
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
the roads and we have another slide
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
is of the 4600 miles of Roads 1100 miles
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
of them aren't eligible for federal
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
funds and they rely strictly on state
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
funds so we really want to just break
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
this up and let you let you know that um
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
we break it up by cheers to sort of
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
break it down a little bit more than the
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
class system because we we sort of need
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
to because some of the roads are
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
eligible and some aren for federal aid
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
and we need to to be able to separate
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
those out
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you and appreciate you
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
taking that question so you know I guess
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
please continue M I guess however
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
however oh I'm sorry commissioner yeah
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
oh I was just G to say however it works
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
for the for the commission we uh uh for
 
01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:10.839 align:start position:0%
the committee if uh if there are
 
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions as we go we certainly uh okay
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
so it's all right and I don't mean there
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
different way we just want to get
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
through the information we want to be as
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
efficient with your time as as possible
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
but certainly as we get through what we
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that uh that you
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
understand things as well too so please
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
yeah there question okay I appreciate
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
your flexibility and members of the
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee have questions but otherwise I
 
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
please continue with your presentation
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
great thank you so from a high level
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
overview on on page 11 um we we talk
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
about the Federal Highway funding um and
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
the commissioner sort of touched on on
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
this with the federal reauthorization so
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the last 10year plan cycle we were at
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
the very beginning of of getting the the
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
infra or infrastructure investment and
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
jobs the iiga which then was passed into
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
law as the the bill law the bipartisan
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law we don't call it bill
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
because we just swing our heads back and
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
forth because everybody's name Bill at
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
the department no only kidding um so we
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
refer to at the iig um so that
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
reauthorization took place in 2002 and
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
it set to expire in 202 or sorry 2022
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
and it set to expire in
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
2026 so it it really only covers 2025
 
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
and 26 of of the 10-year plan that
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
funding um and is is constrainted in the
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
10year plan currently at $234 million
 
01:07:38.079 --> 01:07:39.430 align:start position:0%
10year plan currently at $234 million
per

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
year we assume one of our strategies is
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
that when that expires it may or may not
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
be extended um and or there may be an
 
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
additional reauthorization we don't know
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
what that future is but we have assumed
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan that we're going to
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
have that level funding continue at that
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
same level so one of the strategies is
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
to assume that we would receive at least
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
$234 million per year in the remaining
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
out years of the 10-year plan
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
historically we haven't seen a decrease
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
in federal funds uh but we can also
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
guarantee an increase um so we've
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
assumed level funding uh to be
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
conservative one of the other um issues
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
that we dealt with in this year plan was
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
an increased um inflation rate as
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
everybody knows inflation is increased
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh we've seen a skyrocketing escalation
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
construction uh bid prices material
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
costs supply chain issues with
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
contractors and that all those issues
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
have related into higher than than
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
anticipated bid prices on our project so
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
typically in the past 10-year plan um we
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
had a infl infation rate of 2.8% per
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
year um basically what we've done is
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
every year um every project is escalated
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
2 point the
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
cost let me step back the way we
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
estimate the project is today's dollars
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
we use today's dollars to estimate what
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
the Project's worth and then we we
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
inflate um every year those dollars
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
until we get to the year that the
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
project is in the 10-year plan so it'll
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
it'll it accounts for inflation um
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
escalation and cost to some degree the
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
last 10year plan it was 2.8% previous
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
plans it was about 2% because of the
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
inflation escalation rate um we've done
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
an analysis um and reviewed um
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
anticipated inflation over that 10-year
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
period and we've increased Deb inflation
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
rate to
 
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
3.7% per year and all the projects in
 
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
the the 10-year plan I mention that
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
basically because without adding a
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
single project to the plan just
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
increasing the inflation uh increase the
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of the plan by $100
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
million so that that is a component um
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
and in funding the plan uh is that
 
01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
inflation uh as I said some of the the
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
bid prices that we've seen lately and
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
and if you follow the bids that we've
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
been receiving we've
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
as we try to catch up and anticipate um
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
they just keep going up one of the one
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
of the things that we do is we have a
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
construction cost index that monitors
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
bid prices for certain items structural
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
steel pavement uh you know excavation
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
gravel and so we monitor that and we see
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
Trends and you know a simple one is
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
structural steel in the last year we've
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
seen structural steel costs uh almost go
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
up a 100% in bids so
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I think you've seen that in some of
 
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
the bids that we received for the
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
general Sullivan Bridge uh the cbook
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
Hampton Bridge the the the bid price for
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
for some of these items is just um you
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
know been uh unprecedented um and and
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
hard to follow um from a from a a a an
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
estimating standpoint so um one of the
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
things that um the other component is uh
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
the programmatic um level I talked about
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
what a programmatic is
 
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
so we program about a these
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
programmatics represent about 120 $130
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
million a year in the plan if you added
 
01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
them all up um we assume that we'll fund
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
those programmatics at the same level um
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
as they are in the 10-year plan in the
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
two new years that were added so we've
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
just added the same programmatic level
 
01:11:53.159 --> 01:11:54.590 align:start position:0%
just added the same programmatic level
funding

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
um in uh the the outer years in 33 and
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
34 that existed uh in the in the rest of
 
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.470 align:start position:0%
34 that existed uh in the in the rest of
the

01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
plan those programmatics are shown on on
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
pages 234
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
2374 or of the
 
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.270 align:start position:0%
2374 or of the
plan

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that we did do
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
if you compared it to the last 10-year
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
plan we use the funding levels from the
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
the the 21 through 30 plan not the 23
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
through 32 plan not the last plan and
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is we didn't know
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what what buckets what flavors
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
of funds we were going to get with the
 
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
iig we knew we were going to get so much
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
more money um so some of the way we did
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
that was we we put some of those funds
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
for for Paving and bridges in the
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
programmatics as as sort of placeholders
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
because we didn't really know where they
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
were going to be allocated um and so
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's why we didn't use the last
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
10-year plan funding because it was sort
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
of distorted a little because of that
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
unknown uh factor of where um that
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
additional funding would come
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
from um on page 12 one of the things
 
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
that we did receive and the commissioner
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
touched on this was with the iiga came
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
some new federal
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
programs um those new federal programs
 
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh there were several uh Bridge programs
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
the the bridge bill money uh the mo bill
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
money which is Municipal owned
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
Bridge money um and Bridge exempt funds
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
so some of the keys to this is that
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
allows uh the use of federal funds on
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal Bridges
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
um and that is sort of
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
unprecedented uh to to be able to use uh
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
federal funds on on bridges that aren't
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
really F federally eligible and this is
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
because the the recognition that a lot
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the communities um you know
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the country don't have um the
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
funding to replace some and and repair
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
some of the bridges that they have so
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
this was an opportunity to for us to
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
expand on um uh funding you know
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal Bridges uh in the last
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
cycle um we were able to use the funds
 
01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
cycle um we were able to use the funds
to

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
accelerate a lot of our state bridge Aid
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
Bridges so we moved a lot of those
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
bridges forward and we're able to to to
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
to move a lot of do a lot of those work
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
those bridges and and uh for the
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
communities and what that allows us to
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
do is now back feed um the the rest of
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan uh with these funds and
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about it a little later but
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
we were able to add uh 56 Municipal
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
bridges into the the 10-year plan uh
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
using this funding so um that was a
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
a a big win uh for the municipalities um
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
with the the new program um the nevi
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
program is new and is is being
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
implemented so that's the national
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle infrastructure program
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
um creates uh alternative fuel corridors
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
um and places um
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh ALS ultimately will'll construct uh
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
and place electric vehicle Chargers
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
along those corridors throughout the
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
state uh there's protect funds which is
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
a Statewide and um Coastal resiliency
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
program uh allows us to uh to use that
 
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
funding to create uh uh uh infrastruct
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
or infrastructure Coastal and and
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide um uh improvements for storm
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
damage um Coastal resilience Etc there's
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
also the carbon Reduction Program
 
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
similar to CAC um we're allowed to uh to
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
fund certain programs that um that
 
01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
reduce our carbon footprint so EV um and
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of the programs that qualify for
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
CMAC also qualify for this program
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
except there isn't an air quality
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
component to it like CMAC has there's
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
also a new discretionary grants I did
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
not list them all because they're
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
there's at least 20 new discretionary
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
grants that are out there some of them
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
um states can apply for some of them
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
just Regional planning commissions and
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
communities can uh apply for um so
 
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
there's a plethora of of new grant
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities um the the struggle we
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
have is the eligibility and the rules
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
and the restrictions don't all come out
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
at the same time and I think we'll hear
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
about that with in the CAC program is um
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
understanding the rules and the and the
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions um is something that's very
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
complicated um so that does yes sir okay
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
all right sorry yeah representative
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
alone please thank you for taking thank
 
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
my question so just on the discretionary
 
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
grants do you have a dollar figure on
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
that for how much money that the state
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
has um so we do not we don't budget for
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
um or you won't
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
see anticipated
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh grants in our 10year plan we apply
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
for them and if we're awarded them then
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see them so like the raise grant
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
for um the general suiv Bridge we
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
receive $20
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
million but one of the things would be
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the federal funding and
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
stuff that we talk about is is Formula
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
funding so that's formula that is a
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
portion to the States and it's it's um
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's guaranteed the discretionary grants
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
are competitive grants programs that are
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
set up nationally um there was a lot of
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
money in the iig set aside for these
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants um so when you ask
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
how much the state gets it's it's un
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
undetermined we do try to compete um uh
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants that that that we
 
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
have received we do reflect in the
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
10-year plan Bill mentioned the go uh
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
General Sullivan bridge and there are
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
some other projects um but by and large
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
because it's because it's it's
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary because it's competitive
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
um we don't we don't budget for it if we
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
if we are successful in in receiving
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
some Grant funds um it helps it helps
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
def Fray costs and inflation but it's
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
hard to budget for that because it's
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's like winning the it's like winning
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
the lottery you don't necessarily budget
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
for winning the lottery you have a
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
followup for some belong yes followup
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
just real quick so uh you're tracking
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
how much money is these discretionary
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
grants come to to New Hampshire over the
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
years or okay yes and one more where
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
would I find that
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
information uh we could we we could uh I
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's um it's probably
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
scattered in several different programs
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
but um we can get to I mean we keep a
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
list of the program of the discretionary
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
grants that that we get we could get you
 
01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
that information for thank you so much
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you thank you
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass and uh Mr fron that
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
question please continue I I I would
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
just mention that some of the some of
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
the the grants that are that the
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
communities apply for and get are direct
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
recipient grants so the money goes
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
directly to those and we don't have an
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
involvement so we don't oversee some of
 
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
those we have we do have a listing of
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
them uh but we don't we don't
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily oversee or manage or even
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
are involved in it in some of those
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
those grants um
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
on page 13 uh talk a little bit about
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
State funding and where the state funds
 
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
come from really the three sources of
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
State funds are Turnpike betterment and
 
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.629 align:start position:0%
State funds are Turnpike betterment and
SB

01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:57.639 align:start position:0%
SB
 
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
367 uh Turnpike Revenue comes from tolls
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
so toll Revenue uh and bonding that
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
represents about $48 million per year
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
and just a reminder that the toll system
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system is an Enterprise System
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's self-contained so the so money does
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
stays within the the turnpike system
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't it can't be used on anything but
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
we don't add Federal money to the
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
turnpike system to the and the tolls
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
stay in the turnpike system so it's a
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
self-contained unit uh the betterment
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
side which is our state gas tax um road
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
toll three cents a gallon we um that
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
involves it collects about $21 million
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
per year and SB
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
367 which was a a short term uh increase
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
in the gas tax uh 4.2 cents per gallon
 
01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.350 align:start position:0%
in the gas tax uh 4.2 cents per gallon
uh

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
represents a revenue of about $34
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
million per year got a little discussion
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
coming up about uh about that and um uh
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
the sunsetting of that uh program as
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
well uh so impacts to the state system
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've we've
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
noticed in in this plan is uh we monitor
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
traffic volume we use the traffic volume
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
counts as uh a key indicator uh because
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
more people on the road we collect more
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
tolls more people on the road they buy
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
more gas um so those are the two that's
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
sort of our main indicator of of Revenue
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
projections on on the on the state and
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
the Turnpike
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
System since 2019 if you if you look at
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
2019 Through The covid Years where we
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
saw a drastic decrease in traffic back
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
up to current um you know we had
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
projected from 2019 what traffic would
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
be in
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
2024 um we're about 3 to 4% less um than
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
what we had projected in
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
2019 so over the last couple 10year plan
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
Cycles um we've had to adjust Revenue
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
projections uh from a toll side and from
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
a gas tax side uh based upon that that
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
lower traffic volume and what that
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
really relates to from a a Turnpike
 
01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.590 align:start position:0%
really relates to from a a Turnpike
standpoint

01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.910 align:start position:0%
standpoint
um

01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
is as I stated total revenue in we use
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
that that those funds to fund
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance and capital projects in the
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
turnpike system we can't really spend
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
more money than we have um so what that
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
means is we have
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
a we have a a model and a a prediction
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
of project costs versus um project
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
expenditures versus Revenue Vue in and
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that that's that's
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
sort of level so one of the things that
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
we show with some of our major Turnpike
 
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
projects is that we we would have to
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
delay some of them um we'll talk about
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that in a little bit but that was with
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
the basically the reduction in in total
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
revenue in we couldn't afford to to
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
build all the projects on time as
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
schedule uh with the with the current
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
costs uh on the betterment side
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
um that reflects with a decrease in
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
funding um it also reflects a a decrease
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
in our Paving program we use that that
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
money to pave and on S SP 367 that
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue uh also uh shows a
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
decrease in the availability for state
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
aid Bridge funding um as well as
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh Paving program so one thing
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
I would caveat that with is we review
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
this every 10-year plan cycle so there's
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
adjustments every two years in these
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
projections in in this Revenue
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
prediction but our snapshot in time
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
right now that's sort of what um what
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
we've looked
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
at I would also say that it's not just
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
people traveling um from you know a toll
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
you know a road toll Revenue gas tax uh
 
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
it's also the increase in uh miles per
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
gallon of vehicles gas
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh the the the greater miles per gallon
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
they get the less gas they use so we
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
also seeing just a reduction in the in
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
the gallons uh that are used yes sir so
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
um again represent B would like to ask a
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
question go ahead please thank you thank
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you had
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh as we're modifying
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
some of the highways tier one type
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
projects that you're incorporating EV
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
administers the EV stations if the state
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
is paying for the station itself to get
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
the charging station itself to go in
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
place who
 
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
administers the charging apparatus and
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
who collects the revenues or is their
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
revenues generated by someone plugging
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
stations he's got his head down um yes
 
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
so no yes so the the nevi program what
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
we did was we developed a plan and that
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
plan in involved what corridors we were
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to invest or in charging stations
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
we've put out uh
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
a a request for proposal in
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
RFP um for the funding that's available
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
it's about $17 million total over the
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
fiveyear program um and people are it's
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
a competitive process uh for proposals
 
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.669 align:start position:0%
a competitive process uh for proposals
for

01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
companies uh to put in charging stations
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
we will fund those charging stations
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
are from what we what we can tell it's
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's electric companies who are working
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
with private entities um to put in these
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
charging stations they do have the abil
 
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a pay for the electricity pay
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the charging stations pay for it
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
installed and then uh the the the
 
01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
company who runs it owns it uh has the
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
ability to charge uh the consumer um at
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
the at the charger uh for the
 
01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
electric thank you please
 
01:26:47.239 --> 01:26:50.070 align:start position:0%
electric thank you please
continue

01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
um so on on page 14 continued sort of
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
discussion this is sort of a highlight
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 um uh that came about
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
last last uh budget cycle at the 2425
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
budget um so I had mentioned uh some of
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
the the Outreach from the transit folks
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
um appreciative with for the the funding
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
that was given to them that was um an
 
01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
increase of of $1.89 million that was in
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
house bill to last last budget what that
 
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
did was
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
um uh FTA Federal Transit Administration
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
increased funds available to the state
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
that requires a state match to accept
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
those funds and to use those funds we
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't have state money um to to match so
 
01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:43.719 align:start position:0%
the the legislature and their their
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
their kindness um increased and set
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
aside $1.89 million so that we could use
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
State money on to match that Federal
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
Federal program that and I I tend to
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
believe that this afternoon during the
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
public hearing you might hear testimony
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
about the use of that Transit funds and
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
and how well it was received and what
 
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
came out of um uh that funding so
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
um that is uh that was uh
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
just some of the some of the funding
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
that came out of House Bill 2 last year
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
and and then also out of House Bill too
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
came uh $10 million uh block grant aid
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
funds were directed to municipalities as
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
well as $10 million for local Bridges
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
those were directed communities uh in
 
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2024 those don't show up in
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan uh but it allowed those
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
communities uh to advance repairs and
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
and replace local uh Bridges and and
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
Road repairs um so on page
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
15 talk about the funding and the
 
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
investment Strate strategies um where
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
the where the funding goes um that uh
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
receive so this is shows a distribution
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
of the funds um and where the funds are
 
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
spent as I said it's a 10 it's A5
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
billion doll program The Road and Bridge
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
mode which is pavement Bridges um our ma
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
what we show as mandated programs uh
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
individual projects roadside and debt
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
that all comes out of the road
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh and bridge mode represents 84% of the
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
program or
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
$420 million per year the other modes
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
Transit rail airport represents 16% of
 
01:29:37.109 --> 01:29:37.119 align:start position:0%
the plan um and in the investment about
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
$80 million per year on average so on
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
page 16 we talk a little bit about if I
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
if I could hold hold uh just for a
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
moment the
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
um um I'd like to pause the um the the
 
01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
discussion or presentation at this point
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
in time so that we could take back up a
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
executive session and then we'll
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
continue on if that's all right with the
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
Department absolutely I appreciate the
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
deadline so I will um House Bill 1202
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to open Kamar recess executive
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
session on um house bill uh 122
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
FN um you have an amendment before
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%

180 thank you and thank you for catching
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
that representative boy wh off blurbing
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
as we speak all right um with
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
that um we we are finished with our
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
executive session we return back to the
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
presentation by do I apologize for the
 
01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:21.159 align:start position:0%
delay thank you exent not a not a
 
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
problem at all um so on page 16 we talk
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the strategies that
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
we used in the 10-year plan I I won't go
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
over them again because I've talked
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
about some of them but basically um
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on maintenance and
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
preservation of the existing roads um
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
and investing in those core programs uh
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
pavment roads Bridges getting Bridges
 
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
off the red list and um and fixing um
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure uh Culver's gar rail
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
payment markings
 
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
Etc um Federal
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
reauthorization uh maintaining um the
 
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
projects that are in the 10-year plan
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
and uh we as I said we took account of
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
inflation and escalation in costs um and
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
considered the new projects uh from the
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions entering
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the new the new years of the 10e plan
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
on page 17 talk a little bit about the
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
federal aid programs that exist so um I
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
as I like to say the federal government
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us a giant Lottery check
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
and all the money at once uh they divvy
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
it up and put rules and restrictions on
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
each little bucket so um we do have
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
primary funding which is Highway and
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
bridges and you sort of see how it's
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
broken into different programs but we
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
also have mandated Federal programs that
 
01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
we we are required to um to develop and
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
and uh create projects in highway safety
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
r rail Crossing programs uh CMAC program
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
to program Etc these are all formula
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
allocations so commissioner touched on
 
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
this formula allocation so you get
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
Federal gas tax all goes into the
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
federal system there's a a formula in
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
which how much New Hampshire gets of
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
that money there's also a formula on how
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
that money is broken down into these
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
little separate buckets so we get um we
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
get our allocation broken up by formula
 
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
we don't generally don't get adjust it
 
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't get adjusted up or down either
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
way um except by uh by the federal
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
government uh based upon Revenue in uh
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
so each as I said each program contains
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
specific requirements and eligibility um
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
so that's something we have to go
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
through and and when we talk about say
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
the nvi program there's certain
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
requirements that go into uh the
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle icle charging there's
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
certain requirements uh for a project to
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
get into the highway safety Improvement
 
01:38:59.709 --> 01:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
program um and so that's sort of the the
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
rules that we we deal with uh on the
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
turnpike side which is slide
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
18 we break the the turnpike uh program
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
into two two buckets renewal and
 
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
replacement um basically renewal and
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
replacement sounds sounds like it is we
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
spent about $20 million uh preserving
 
01:39:21.149 --> 01:39:21.159 align:start position:0%
maintaining and upgrading the existing
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
system uh the turnpike Capital program
 
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
are our major projects and these are
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest projects that
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
you'll find in the 10year plan they tend
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
to be mostly Interstate projects the
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
most extensive type of
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
projects this is where I'll hesitate and
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
take a pause because this is one of the
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
harder things to explain so in the
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
beginning we talked about due to the
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
toll Pike turn Turnpike toll Revenue
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
decrease that some of the projects had
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
to be delayed and moved out one of the
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
things that we also heard that that I
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned in public testimony was uh
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester exit 6 and 7 there was a lot
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
of consternation about moving that
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
project outside the 10-year plan so we
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
reviewed the funding uh took a a finer
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
look at it we looked at so so if you
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
think about this as um uh sort of as a a
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
a household budget you have money in
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
your bank account and then you receive a
 
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
paycheck so you get total revenue and
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
then you have you have an outlay you
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
have a project to do and you have money
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
spent we
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
don't we the way the a project is spent
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
it isn't all spent at once it's spent
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
over every month so a project bills so
 
01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a a smoothing out of the
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures what we want to make sure
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
is we don't expend more money than we
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
take in and we have have allocated so we
 
01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
try to smooth out that expenditures
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
versus uh funding
 
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
so what we did is we relooked at the
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
Nasha marac Bedford project the first
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
one listed is about $227
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
million that actually consists of five
 
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
projects one is already done two more
 
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
are basically under construction right
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
now so the other two um one happens to
 
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
be an extremely large project $120
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
million um are yet to come so we looked
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
at that expenditure and how that would
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
be molded and and and
 
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
adjusted we also looked at
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
um moving the Manchester exit 6 and 7
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
project all back in the
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
plan so that created sort of a spike at
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
the end of the end of the plan um
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
and I will mention the bo conquered
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
project it it shows $171 million that's
 
01:41:49.709 --> 01:41:49.719 align:start position:0%
only the turnpike portion so that
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
project is is a $500 million project
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
$330 million of it is federally
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
funded so that project
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
expands uh quite a few years and what we
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
were able to do is review where we
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
anticipated expending federal funds and
 
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds and be able to use that
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funding and move the projects
 
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
around the the thing with Bo conquered
 
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
is right now it's just one gigantic
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
project we're not going to build it as
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
one gigantic project we'll it'll be
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
broken into pieces to be built so we can
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to adjust the
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
spending for turnpikes and and fill in
 
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
those some of the
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
years so bringing the the Manchester
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
exit 6 and s project did create sort of
 
01:42:45.149 --> 01:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
a bump in in the end we are able to
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
smooth out the spending and and and make
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
it meet you know expenditures versus
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
revenue and until the outer years and
 
01:42:57.870 --> 01:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
what we realized is um that the turnpike
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
has a bond of a a a $200 million bond
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
that is out there we have still have
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
five or $50 million worth of bond
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
Authority that we haven't used if we use
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
that Bond um in the outer years of the
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
10-year plan it allows us to satisfy the
 
01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
the accountants that um were within
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
budget and and to smooth out that that
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh expenditure so we were able to adjust
 
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
these projects bring Manchester back
 
01:43:31.229 --> 01:43:31.239 align:start position:0%
into the 10-year plan uh and be able to
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
accomplish all this um but it would
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
require us uh showing uh bonding that
 
01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
$50 million using that Authority in the
 
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
outer years of the plan as I said with
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
the the sort of the gas tax revenue the
 
01:43:46.109 --> 01:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
turnpike revenue is the same this
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
adjusts every two years um this you know
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
by the time we get uh to needing that
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
Bond we're going to go through this
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
process three or four more times um so
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
there's fluctuations and variability in
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
that but it was it was an exercise that
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
we needed to do to be able to to to say
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we could build these projects and
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
stay within the budget um so that's how
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
we uh we were able to accomplish that on
 
01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:15.149 align:start position:0%
we uh we were able to accomplish that on
page

01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
19 talk a little bit about um the state
 
01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh funding the federal eligibility and
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
um those roads that are not eligible so
 
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
this is the map uh that you
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
have so of the 4600 miles 3,400 of them
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
are eligible for federal funds and the
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
1100 aren't the the ones that aren't uh
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funds that's where
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
we use our betterment funding for and
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
and are tifia pledged SP 367
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
funds um those that's the only money
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
that we have uh to be able to use on
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
those roads the problem we'll get to it
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
probably on the next slide um is that
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
the SB 367 tifia pledge Paving money
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
really expires in
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
2025 and that will mean uh our ability
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
to pave those non-eligible roads
 
01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.189 align:start position:0%
to pave those non-eligible roads
decreases

01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
decreases
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
tremendously um and you know we do have
 
01:45:20.189 --> 01:45:20.199 align:start position:0%
limited um limited State funds to use
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
for Paving and that's shown on the next
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
page on on on page 20 our betterment
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
funds that we use for that that Paving
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
um we spent about three $13 million on
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
Paving using the betterment funds s SP
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
367 to 4.2 cents a gallon we've been
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
able to use about $20 million of that on
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
Paving and and Bridge projects so let me
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
step back and and as a reminder so back
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
when we were doing the I9 3 Sing to
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester project we took out a tifia
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
alone so that we could accelerate the um
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
the construction of those projects that
 
01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
allowed us uh to get them done much
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
sooner than we could if we just used
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds to pay back that tifia
 
01:46:10.589 --> 01:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
loan legislature passed s SP 367 created
 
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
this 4.2 send gas test that was
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
specifically dedicated to pay back the
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
tifia loan but it also had a few other
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
sections to it so 12% of that that
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue that comes in goes to block
 
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
Grand a that's about $4 million a year
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
the we also had Debt
 
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
Service we were able to use uh some of
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
the funds for State Bridge aid program
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
to be able to fund Municipal Bridges and
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
then we had this tifia pledged Paving
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and red listed Bridge work so the
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
way the loan was restructured in the
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
very beginning
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
um we were only required to pay interest
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
payments that left basically 20 million
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
$23 million that we could use for this
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
tifia Pudge Paving it allowed us to use
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
the state funds to to pave the roads uh
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
and and and repair
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
Bridges so in
 
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
2025 that debt um is due so we have to
 
01:47:22.510 --> 01:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
convert that pledge Paving $20 million
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
and pay the debt so that Paving the
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
ability to use that funds to PVE goes
 
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
away so on page 21 we short sort of show
 
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
the the the accounting of that and where
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
this s SP
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
367 uh Debt Service payment comes from
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
so started in
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
2015 uh the First Column is the the the
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
revenue in Municipal block grant Aid
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
funding and then the repayment of the
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
loan and you you'll see in 2026 where
 
01:47:55.229 --> 01:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
that increases to $23 million because
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
that loan is due that's where the pay
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
that payment goes what you'll notice is
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
that that that funding that 23 million
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
that we weren't paying goes directly
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
into that tifia pledged Paving and
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
Bridge repairs which is the second to
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
last column so you'll see that 20
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
million doll so this allowed us to be
 
01:48:19.629 --> 01:48:19.639 align:start position:0%
able to to pave roads that weren't
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
federally El ible um and really keep
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
them in good repair before we were
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to do this we we received calls
 
01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
continually on these tier three tier
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
four roads on how deplorable the
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
condition was and it really came down to
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the funds to pave them we
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have the funds to repair them and
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
I think the use of this funding over the
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
last 10 years has allowed us to make
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
drastic increases in the condition of
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
those roads and um and and and basically
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
reduce the the the amount of red listed
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
Bridges as well so on page 22 we talk a
 
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
little bit about what the ramifications
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
are of not having that $20
 
01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
million and you can sort of see how
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
valuable that was for us the top graph
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
shows the Centerline miles paved you
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
know currently we've been Paving over
 
01:49:21.149 --> 01:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
400 miles per year
 
01:49:24.589 --> 01:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
and the the Bold blue line at the bottom
 
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
if that $20 million uh of s367 goes away
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
we'll show a decrease of about 200 miles
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
per year in our ability to pave so
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
almost half of the paving program was
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
the S SP
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
367 and the bottom line shows the
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
decrease in the fair good condition of
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
the roads we've been able to maintain
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
87% of our roads in Fair good shape
 
01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
um because of this Paving or because of
 
01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
this this this this
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
funding and it shows the less you pave
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
the worst condition the roads get and
 
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
you see a sort of a a proportional deg
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
degradation in the condition of the
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
roads which is the bottom Blue Line in
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
that condition phase so what the other
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
lines represent is we did a litmus test
 
01:50:15.149 --> 01:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
we wanted to see what Revenue we would
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
need to pave the roads to bring the
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
conditions up and we look looked at the
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
Orange Line shows adding about $8
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
million um a year uh into that program
 
01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
it it brings up the paving brings up the
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
condition uh the other remaining line is
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
a is an additional $1 million or or $19
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
million so basically replacing the $20
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
million with $19 million of Paving and
 
01:50:44.669 --> 01:50:44.679 align:start position:0%
it shows being able to maintain that
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
Paving rout and be able to maintain that
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
that pavement condition so
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan this is sort of our
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
biggest challenge is where do we get
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
funds to fill in that hole that's
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
created by um the the reduction in the
 
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
in the S SP 367
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
Paving um and I will will add that in
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
the waterfall chart that you see the
 
01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
when the loan is paid in
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
2034 that entire program expires so once
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
the pay the loan is goes away the 2. or
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
the 4.2 Cent a gallon D tax goes away so
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
the blocker Aid goes away as well as um
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
the the S the State Bridge a goes away
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
so um I would just note that so some of
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
the other programs on on page 23 so as
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner stay we're not just
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
Highway and bridges even though that's
 
01:51:43.069 --> 01:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
all I've talked about uh uh we also uh
 
01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
dedicate about $3 million a year in
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
active Transportation those are complete
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
streets projects multi-use paths uh
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
pedestrian Bridges sidewalks expanded
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
shoulders uh rail trail programs so uh
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
we do invest in in those um those
 
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
programs as well on page 24 um so we we
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
highlighted some of the the individual
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
programs that we we heard about during
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan the CMAC round this was
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
a CAC round um in the 10-year plan we
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
were able to um to to fund and bring in
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
37 uh projects into the 10-year plan um
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
with the we had $44 million available
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
funding 28 uh projects were Transit and
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
active Transportation projects and nine
 
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
were EV
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
applications uh we we also have a
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
handout um that's included that
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
summarizes uh that in further detail
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
also the municipal Bridge solicitation
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
we have a handout this is that
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds to to uh
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
improve Municipal Bridges so we able to
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
bring 56 local Bridges uh into the
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
10-year plan uh using uh this program on
 
01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
page 25 the quter study program this has
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
been in the 10-year plan for a while um
 
01:53:07.069 --> 01:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
we had a an implementation plan it
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
developed PRI uh you know priority
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
criteria um working through the gaset
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
process we've identified uh the top 10
 
01:53:19.629 --> 01:53:19.639 align:start position:0%
priority uh corridors um and those have
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
been identified and there's a map which
 
01:53:25.149 --> 01:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
outlines those um and gas it left it up
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
to us to prioritize uh the order in
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
which we address those the idea is we
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
have funding to address about two a year
 
01:53:38.430 --> 01:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the plan and uh under on page 26
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
the transit
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
programs uh that program represents
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
about $42 million in the 10-year plan
 
01:53:48.669 --> 01:53:48.679 align:start position:0%
about $40 million per year primarily
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
funded through Federal trans Transit
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
Administration um the funding is
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
restricted for transit services Capital
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
operating and planning and it can't be
 
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh transferred for other uses uh I would
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
just say again um at the gaset hearings
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of comment about the use
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
of Transit the need for Transit um the
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
appreciation for the additional funding
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
in transit um and I would just point out
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
the map on the side here uh one of the
 
01:54:18.270 --> 01:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
things that we repeatedly heard uh for
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
from transit units users and and and the
 
01:54:24.189 --> 01:54:24.199 align:start position:0%
public was the lack of an East West
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
Connection um you can go north and south
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
using Transit but if you wanted to go
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
from conquered to Portsmith you have to
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually go through
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
Boston um so that was you know one of
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
the one of the issues that was was
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
brought up is the lack of
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
interconnectivity in the areas um and
 
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
and some of those uh some of the holes
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
that um needed to be filled in the
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
transit system um on page 27 we talk
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's about $346 million programmed
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan about $35 million
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
per year this is primarily uh uh funded
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
through uh Federal Aviation and it's a
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
grant-based program uh funding is
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
restricted um funding can't be
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
transferred for other uses and uh New
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire eligible public use air
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
airports uh typically get a funding of
 
01:55:26.589 --> 01:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
about 90% federal aid 5% State and 5%
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
local funds I I mentioned it's
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
grant-based it's a little bit different
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
than all the other systems we get money
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
from Federal Highway and then we develop
 
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
a plan to spend it
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
um Aviation uh Bureau has to create a
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
plan and then ask for funding so it's a
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
grant-based plan so they come up with an
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
improvement plan they they basically
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
have a a a 10-year plan but they don't
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
have money associated with it then they
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
have to go out and apply for those
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
grants to receive the funding so it's a
 
01:55:59.550 --> 01:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
little bit different uh little Nuance uh
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
in how uh FAA uh funds programs uh on
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
page 28 we talked about the rail program
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
we do have a uh a rail program amounts
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
to about $12 million per year $1.2
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
million per year it's a special railroad
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
funding it's primary primarily funding
 
01:56:20.830 --> 01:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
that we receive for the lease agreements
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
that we have with private rail companies
 
01:56:25.229 --> 01:56:25.239 align:start position:0%
so we own the rail quar we lease that to
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
the rail operators the money that we
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
receive um which is about $1.2 million
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
per year we use that to reinvest in
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance and construction of those
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
lines to keep them in in good
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
repair um so that brings us to the the
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
changes that were made so that o overall
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
is the program um so what went into the
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
10-year plan some of the strategies we
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
used um on page 29 is a list of the
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
projects um that were changed or or had
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
a change to them during the gaset
 
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.109 align:start position:0%
a change to them during the gaset
process

01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
um very briefly we talk about the CAC
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
projects U that were brought
 
01:57:15.229 --> 01:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
in um the quarter study program that was
 
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
brought in uh bringing back Manchester
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh exits 6 and 7
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh within the 10-year plan uh reducing
 
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
the delay um on Bo conquered um from
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
three years to
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
one the um the Newcastle Causeway
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
project we heard a lot about that so
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
what we agreed to do is in the outer
 
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
years of the 10-year plan and if you've
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
seen the flooding that's occurring in
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
the Hampton area um this was an sort of
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
their their request of the causeway
 
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
floods and they don't have a way off the
 
01:57:49.069 --> 01:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
island except going over a red listed
 
01:57:49.079 --> 01:57:50.229 align:start position:0%
island except going over a red listed
Bridge

01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
Bridge
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
um so uh this there's a project in the
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and what we agreed to do
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
was uh accelerate the the design of that
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
so that if we ever did get uh any like
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
resiliency money or protect money we
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
might be able to advance that project um
 
01:58:10.109 --> 01:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
there are two Tilton projects um that we
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
heard about at the Tilton public hearing
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh we were working with those towns
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
adjusting the scope and adjusting the
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
descriptions um to be more in line with
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
what they would they would like
 
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
um uh there was a a Bedford project um
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
it was it was a CT so it didn't qualify
 
01:58:32.069 --> 01:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
as a bridge the the solution is it's
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's a big Culvert that's just under a
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
bridge configuration the the answer is a
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
bridge so we agreed to to put that in
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
our Municipal Bridge uh uh project so we
 
01:58:44.669 --> 01:58:44.679 align:start position:0%
added that as a new project
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the Statewide um exit sign ring
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
project and you have some experience
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
with that I know there was a house bill
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh last couple weeks talked about that
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh gas it removed that uh that project
 
01:59:01.069 --> 01:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh from the 10-year
 
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
plan uh and then there were earmark
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
project this is more of a scrier error
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
that those projects uh earmark projects
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh erroneously didn't have inflation we
 
01:59:13.870 --> 01:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
added inflation to those um on page 30
 
01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
so those are the changes that were
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
occurred in the plan through gaset uh on
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
page 30
 
01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
was um uh the governor's uh changes the
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
first five projects were uh CAC projects
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
um that he uh removed um most of them
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see dealt with the EV charging
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
stations um there was also a Portsmith
 
01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh sidewalk project it the the proposal
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
was to upgrade a sidewalk to a a 10-
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
foot wide path
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
um thought it was sort of a a redundant
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
project because there was already a path
 
01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
there um but what he what he suggested
 
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
doing what he requested us to do was
 
02:00:02.589 --> 02:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
take those funds and uh replace them in
 
02:00:05.229 --> 02:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
in a certain way um so the Hampton
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
Branch rail trail project is underfunded
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
he requested that we add $2.5 million
 
02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
into those projects um to to to help
 
02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
fully fund those or bring the funding up
 
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
um on those because we heard a lot about
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh that project and then um the other
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
three at the bottom of the list were
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
Transit related uh projects um that he
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
would like to see put in some of them
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
were additional monies for programs um
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
as well as um a a a a vehicle use um uh
 
02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
project and and a coast facilities
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement project um and finally on
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
page 31
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
is a do list of changes you'll see it's
 
02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
pretty blank um the one projects in
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
there I talked about the Newcastle
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
Causeway project and in our great
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
hesitation when we when we updated and
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
changed it we took it out of the 10-year
 
02:01:09.149 --> 02:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
plan so so in the new books you have
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's back in the 10-year plan but we
 
02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:12.350 align:start position:0%
it's back in the 10-year plan but we
wanted

02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
to sort of uh fall on our sword and say
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
we made a mistake we clicked the wrong
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
button um and it doesn't show in the
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
10-year plan in the governor's
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
submission it's now back in the 10year
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
plan so what this will be used for as
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
changes are made to the 10year plan um
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
through do
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
action this 10year plan you see is
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
actually a snapshot from six months ago
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
when we
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
started we had to do that because it's a
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
moving living
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
creature we were working on projects
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're we moved projects we've increased
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
funding on projects we could not keep
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
that up in the plan that you see today
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
so what we do is we take that snapshot
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
and what you have today we will re
 
02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
reconcile changes that have been made in
 
02:02:06.750 --> 02:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
the last six months to reality and we'll
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
show that in the change log so what goes
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh to the governor for Signature will be
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
that reconciled copy but we want you to
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
be aware of we've had projects that were
 
02:02:19.629 --> 02:02:19.639 align:start position:0%
listed in 24 to advertised for
 
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
construction in 2024 that is not in the
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
10-year plan they've been moved to 2025
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
that is in the 10-year plan you won't
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
see it in your plan you'll see it on
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
that list so those are the type of
 
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
things that we're talking about will
 
02:02:34.990 --> 02:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
show up on this list um as soon as we're
 
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
done done here so okay with that that's
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
the end of our presentation thank you
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
gentlemen uh representative Jack please
 
02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh so just to
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
be clear everything on these blue Pages
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh you're not asking the you're not
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
waiting for the committee to amend
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
anything that's already been
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
Incorporated those have already been
 
02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:55.719 align:start position:0%
Incorporated yes okay yes representative
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
Mills please yeah I got a couple of uh
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
just and you don't have to go into depth
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
on this but normally we we I
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
I've I've had the information during
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
this presentation um first of all going
 
02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
back to the pavement and I noticed it's
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
down to 260 for years I know our our DOT
 
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
plan had always been that goal was five
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
500 miles are Are We Now adjusting it
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
down is is that or are we still going to
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
strive for the 500 Miles our goal had
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
always been 500 Miles the the the
 
02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
problem is the cost gone up yeah that's
 
02:03:34.830 --> 02:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
just want make we have the same amount
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
of money it when the costs go up it
 
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
means we paid
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
less and okay please continue follow up
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh red lless Bridges we will normally
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
get an update on what the status is I
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
know you said that you've made trend
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
tremendous uh improvements on the
 
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
bridges due to the extra money and if we
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
could just for later on don't have to
 
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:57.639 align:start position:0%
have numbers now but we'll normally get
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
a synopsis of we were at 300 Red List
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
Bridges uh 275 were carried forward and
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
25 were added and 50 were removed
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass that was slide that
 
02:04:13.149 --> 02:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
was the slide we accidentally yeah and
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
then um my final one was um and it's
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
always been concerned to this committee
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
because we're always active in the
 
02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:24.149 align:start position:0%
because we're always active in the
conquered

02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
nashwa Boston Railway Corridor and our
 
02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
solution so far has been the conquered
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
Boston bus lines which we would normally
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
get a a little bit more of an update on
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
the status of what that is now has has
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
that service increased has it decreased
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
I know at one year we went out and
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
actually funded buses for them so they
 
02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
could get up and and increase the
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
schedule and if we could just get a
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
little recap for that later on and with
 
02:04:56.189 --> 02:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair that ends my question okay
 
02:04:56.199 --> 02:04:57.270 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair that ends my question okay
thank

02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
you Jack uh thank you again uh just I'm
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
a little fiscal year challenge so this
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
is the last bium where we have the
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
367 going to highways and so next bium
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
we would have to come up with a $20
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
million replacement plan if we wanted to
 
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
continue doing that correct yeah it EXP
 
02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
Ires our our use of the pavement expires
 
02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:21.589 align:start position:0%
Ires our our use of the pavement expires
in

02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
2025 oh yes represent abbit please yes
 
02:05:28.589 --> 02:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
if you could just go back to page
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
15 in the
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
presentation I get what um the approv
 
02:05:37.709 --> 02:05:37.719 align:start position:0%
funding comes through and my question is
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.750 align:start position:0%
what is the
individual

02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
so an individual project is a a
 
02:05:47.549 --> 02:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
basically a standalone project that we
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
we do um um it comes in usually they
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
come in through the regional Planning
 
02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
Commission or they could be a red listed
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
Bridge Project um General Sol well it's
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
probably a bad example
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
um uh CRA Campton the lift bridge um
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
over the the river that's a standalone
 
02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
project you if you looked in the plan
 
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see cber Campton it's
 
02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
self-contained self-funded so an
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
individual project are those projects
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
that are not part of a programmatic or
 
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.149 align:start position:0%
that are not part of a programmatic or
mandate

02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
or fit into another program it's a
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
basically a a self-contained project
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
under of
 
02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
itself okay thank you further questions
 
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
yes please represent jurly thank you Mr
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
chairman on page 30 projects uh
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
44626 in Nasha and
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
44629 in conid what what the total
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
amount for those projects total dollar
 
02:06:47.709 --> 02:06:47.719 align:start position:0%
amounts that uh it's like they were
 
02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
removed in the
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
plan I think they were consistently
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
about $1.8 million most of those were I
 
02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
I think we're typically that that amount
 
02:07:02.109 --> 02:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
but we have Checkers in the back of the
 
02:07:02.119 --> 02:07:03.950 align:start position:0%
but we have Checkers in the back of the
room

02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
no yeah we can get we can get you that
 
02:07:06.639 --> 02:07:08.229 align:start position:0%
no yeah we can get we can get you that
definitive

02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
definitive
 
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
answer thank you further questions
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
please ref Newman
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
please thank you again on page 30 um in
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
the manchest you're removing the project
 
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
this would be for Ev dispensers at
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
Market Basket grocery
 
02:07:28.109 --> 02:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
stores is anybody aware do any Market
 
02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
baskets in the state have EV uh stations
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
at their
 
02:07:34.599 --> 02:07:36.109 align:start position:0%
at their
places

02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
places
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes I believe they do I think the the
 
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
particularly I know the new ones in um
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
Penacook the new Mark basket there do um
 
02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:47.719 align:start position:0%
I do believe in um Plymouth as well too
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's a new market basket and stuff
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
there that they do so a couple of the
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
projects that they that they did um that
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
that that these were um removed in the
 
02:07:59.790 --> 02:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
governance phase they were the these
 
02:08:02.109 --> 02:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
tended to be outliers they they were the
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
ones that that uh were more expensive
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
than than the average uh projects in
 
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
there so and I think an attempt to um
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
better balance some of that that that
 
02:08:17.549 --> 02:08:17.559 align:start position:0%
program that that um um eliminating some
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the um higher cost EV charging
 
02:08:23.069 --> 02:08:23.079 align:start position:0%
projects and redirecting some of that
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
money toward Community Transportation
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
and the rail trails and active
 
02:08:26.239 --> 02:08:27.589 align:start position:0%
and the rail trails and active
Transportation

02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
02:08:30.750 --> 02:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
was you kind of the Bal Balancing Act
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
there yeah thank you thank you
 
02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative faulman please thank you
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
going back to page 13 want to understand
 
02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:43.559 align:start position:0%
allocation of
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
the so-called gas
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
tax you've accounted for S cents there's
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
another 15 cents and just we clear that
 
02:08:51.599 --> 02:08:52.790 align:start position:0%
another 15 cents and just we clear that
15

02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
15
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
cents goes to
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.589 --> 02:09:02.599 align:start position:0%
a is there a firm division of the uh of
 
02:09:05.549 --> 02:09:05.559 align:start position:0%
the of the highway
 
02:09:08.430 --> 02:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
fund by splitting that uh or is that
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
just the way we've programmed
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
it I I I don't know if I understand your
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at funding State
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
turn by tolls you've got betterment 3
 
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
cents sp3 67 4.2 so there's another 15
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
cents in the gas tax and then there's uh
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration fees that are on
 
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
top of that how are those funds
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
additional funds accounted for they I
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
know some of them go to operations a lot
 
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
of them go to operations yeah these are
 
02:09:39.629 --> 02:09:39.639 align:start position:0%
these are the dedicated funds from the
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
highway from the from the road toll and
 
02:09:45.069 --> 02:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
the gas tax that go to these these
 
02:09:45.079 --> 02:09:47.109 align:start position:0%
the gas tax that go to these these
programs

02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
um uh we have a breakdown we usually
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
discuss it in depth when we're at the
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
budget budget phase but most of most of
 
02:09:57.549 --> 02:09:57.559 align:start position:0%
the gas tax goes to um the operating
 
02:09:59.149 --> 02:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
costs of Department of Transportation
 
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
and Department of of safety these These
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
are called out because these are
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds from the gas tax that go
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
to these specific um um and and
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
restricted to these specific purposes um
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
so part of the gas tax goes to um you
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
know goes to block grant Aid uh some it
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
then then filters down and goes also to
 
02:10:23.229 --> 02:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
um Department of Safety and the other
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
agencies as it's appropriated out of the
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
um um undesignated Revenue into the
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
highway fund um we have that in the
 
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
budget if if you're interested at at the
 
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
work session we can go over over that
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
for clarity um we have that broken down
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
quite detailed I'll defer that to them
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay please go ahead
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
represent kazinski right thank you thank
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question kind on the
 
02:10:48.639 --> 02:10:49.470 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question kind on the
same

02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:10:54.910 --> 02:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
line um am I to believe that 100% of the
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
gas tax and 100% of the road toll goes
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
to Transportation expenses
 
02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
no about 60% goes to Transportation
 
02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:07.990 align:start position:0%
no about 60% goes to Transportation
operating

02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
operating
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
expenses close to 40% goes also to um
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
cost of Collections and Department of
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
Safety and other um other uh other
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
agencies that are
 
02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
out of the highway fund does any go in
 
02:11:22.990 --> 02:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
no thank you okay that's it okay thank
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
you for your question further questions
 
02:11:30.990 --> 02:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
of commissioner Cass and Mr oldenberg uh
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
I have one gentlemen so in the
 
02:11:35.549 --> 02:11:35.559 align:start position:0%
presentation it looks like and I this is
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
a bit 10 years from now but if we don't
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
do anything with the gas tax revenue or
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
change our system which we're working on
 
02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
now then the the 4.2 cents that we
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
passed 10 years years ago that this
 
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
committee recommended we all went along
 
02:11:53.669 --> 02:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
with in the legislature would that go
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
away right the gas tax would be reduced
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
is that correct is I and not the revenue
 
02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be available for funding
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
different programs correct on on the
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
books on on the books right now on the
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
debt service for the Tiffy loan for i93
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
is paid off in around
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
2034 uh the current legislation calls
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
for that 4.2 cents to Sunset and go
 
02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
away okay okay for yes represent Jack
 
02:12:20.189 --> 02:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
please yes but as I asked you rep
 
02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
following up on that uh it's not
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
available starting next year because
 
02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's being used to pay the loan so
 
02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
there's no Highway work there's no
 
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
further Highway work being done with
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.069 --> 02:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
loan that's that that that that portion
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
of it if you look at that chart in the
 
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
waterfall there is still um a percentage
 
02:12:43.069 --> 02:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
of it that goes to block grant a a
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of it that goes to that that
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
that waterfall goes to state aid Bridge
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
Bridge um then and then the and then The
 
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
Debt Service uh but there is nothing
 
02:12:55.669 --> 02:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
left afterwards for any typical uh
 
02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
Paving a bridge or or or betterment type
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
of uh work but there is there is still
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
there is still that waterfall that is in
 
02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
place um as as the as the revenue comes
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
in so the state a bridge would continue
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
and and the and the
 
02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:14.599 align:start position:0%
betterment and there yeah right yes so
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at what what sheet was that
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
on sheet 21
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
so that's a total revenue say in 2030
 
02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
say 2026 so this 30 about $34 million of
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh rad toll from that 4.2 cents uh 12%
 
02:13:34.549 --> 02:13:34.559 align:start position:0%
goes to cities and towns through
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal block grant Aid um 2026 about
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
$23.4 million will go to pay the debt
 
02:13:46.350 --> 02:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
service and the remaining then goes to
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
um uh state a bridge for municipal
 
02:13:52.549 --> 02:13:52.559 align:start position:0%
Bridges but then there is nothing else
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh remaining um beyond that whereas in
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.069 --> 02:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
been so just just for clarity you are
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
you are essentially right but I just
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that it does that all
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
of that 4.2 cents today does not go to
 
02:14:12.510 --> 02:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
um Highway and Bridge it goes through
 
02:14:14.589 --> 02:14:14.599 align:start position:0%
that uh waterfall established in the
 
02:14:14.599 --> 02:14:16.189 align:start position:0%
that uh waterfall established in the
bill

02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
Sol okay thank you ref Jack commissioner

the Capital C or being there as a new
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%

yes represent Jack please and following
 
02:15:21.310 --> 02:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
up just so we get this on the record the
 
02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
Dot's position is that we could not
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
continue to the 5309 construction phase
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
without doing more work on the on the
 
02:15:35.549 --> 02:15:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.559 --> 02:15:38.629 align:start position:0%
 
planning

02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
um what what is 5309 uh that's the the
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
construction phase uh competitive grant
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:49.790 align:start position:0%
construction phase uh competitive grant
funding

02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
correct yes yeah we we we had just for
 
02:15:57.069 --> 02:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
clarity we we had um completed uh all of
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
the draft documents a draft
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statement a draft
 
02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
financial plan um to proceed any any
 
02:16:07.950 --> 02:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
further would have required some some um
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
additional um additional work finalizing
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
the environmental document further
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
coordination with uh FTA and actually
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
preparing a a grant
 
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
application so um with that said that
 
02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
that's where we had left it with those
 
02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
with those draft documents um to to see
 
02:16:31.229 --> 02:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
where we go from there and followup uh
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
do we know what the cost of that
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
additional work might
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
be uh the additional work to um to
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
complete like an a a new starts Grant
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
application yes we had an estimate for
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
that in our in our in our budget I don't
 
02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
know what it is off the top of my head
 
02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
but uh through the work session if
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're interested uh we we do we do we
 
02:16:57.150 --> 02:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
we had uh we had scoped that out but I
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
can't I don't know the number off the
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
top of my head but we can get that for
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you ref thank you
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
for being willing to come back and
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
provide that at a a future work session
 
02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
okay yes repesent Newman please yes
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
thank you following up on representative
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
Jack's question so the amount of work
 
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
that has been done on the capital
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
Corridor but has been put on
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
hold do you have an amount of that in
 
02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
other words the cost an estimated cost
 
02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
stopped yes yes yes I again I'm not
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
prepared I have that all in another
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
folder and we can bring that and talk
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
about it but and and I and and I and I
 
02:17:42.830 --> 02:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
guess I would also clarify that I don't
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
know if it's actually been put on hold I
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
think we fulfilled what we were there
 
02:17:51.549 --> 02:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
was always a question of of next steps
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
and and and funding for Grant
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
application or funding for construction
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
or or anything to move it move it
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
forward so um we so I would just uh you
 
02:18:04.030 --> 02:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
know clarify we we pretty much completed
 
02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
the scope that we had
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
identified with the exception of
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
carrying it forward to the um to the
 
02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:12.030 align:start position:0%
carrying it forward to the um to the
Grant

02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
application um piece of that but I I do
 
02:18:17.709 --> 02:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
believe that there was always going to

fortunate enough to get our own

03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
CNG or or all electric buses so uh newer
 
03:38:28.349 --> 03:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
models with more fuel efficiency
 
03:38:33.389 --> 03:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
um looking at time uh also here um the
 
03:38:36.189 --> 03:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
the uh Municipal representatives from
 
03:38:38.550 --> 03:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
our commission also requested more
 
03:38:40.670 --> 03:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
transparency on why the selected SE ra
 
03:38:42.189 --> 03:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
projects were removed from the draft
 
03:38:42.199 --> 03:38:43.229 align:start position:0%
projects were removed from the draft
10-year

03:38:43.229 --> 03:38:43.239 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
plan uh last on specific projects uh a
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
bridge in Durham Bennett Road over the
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh the railroad now owned by CSX uh has
 
03:38:52.950 --> 03:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
a Timber deck that is not rated for
 
03:38:55.950 --> 03:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
heavy duty vehicles and it requires
 
03:38:58.469 --> 03:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
their local uh solid waste removal fire
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
trucks or emergency response um and and
 
03:39:04.189 --> 03:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
heavy plows to make a long detour as
 
03:39:08.110 --> 03:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
there isn't a a nearby road to get over
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
the the railroad tracks there um so that
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
um wasteful and inefficient in in the
 
03:39:14.910 --> 03:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
best case and potentially
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
life-threatening for their emergency
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
response um so the current 10-year plan
 
03:39:22.590 --> 03:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
has construction funds in 2026 the new
 
03:39:25.950 --> 03:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
draft uh moves that to 2028 and the the
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
the town is wishing that those funds
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
could remain in 2026 for
 
03:39:34.349 --> 03:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
construction um I I'll go very briefly
 
03:39:36.189 --> 03:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh over some of the overarching things
 
03:39:37.910 --> 03:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the handout that I left at at
 
03:39:40.269 --> 03:39:40.279 align:start position:0%
everyone's place um related to the 10e
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
year plan uh that the straford re RPC
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
supports in terms of um keeping the
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
system performing well and that includes
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh making making sure highway travel is
 
03:39:54.990 --> 03:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
reliable and supporting investment in uh
 
03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
more diverse modes modes like public
 
03:40:01.030 --> 03:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
buses passenger Rail and inner city bus
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
um keeping up with infrastructure costs
 
03:40:06.429 --> 03:40:06.439 align:start position:0%
is a a local and national issue I'm sure
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
you all know um and we're will require
 
03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
updating our funding mechanisms
 
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
climate change is also an increasing
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
threat to infrastructure and the
 
03:40:16.349 --> 03:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
livelihoods of New Hampshire residents
 
03:40:18.189 --> 03:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
and demands increased investment in
 
03:40:19.630 --> 03:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
adaptation and
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation uh safety is an extremely
 
03:40:25.389 --> 03:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
important issue for our commissioners um
 
03:40:27.550 --> 03:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
as part of our work we map crashes that
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
result in fatalities and serious
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
injuries those dots on a map are people
 
03:40:34.870 --> 03:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
or were people uh and all too often we
 
03:40:37.630 --> 03:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
know them personally um our our planning
 
03:40:39.550 --> 03:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
starts from the policy that zero is the
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
only except acceptable number of
 
03:40:43.510 --> 03:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
fatalities and serious injuries on on
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:49.710 --> 03:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh there is increased demand
 
03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
for public transportation throughout
 
03:40:53.229 --> 03:40:53.239 align:start position:0%
Southeast New Hampshire um this is
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
especially true with our uh aging
 
03:40:58.750 --> 03:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
population for example Coast uh our
 
03:41:01.309 --> 03:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
regional transit provider along with UNH
 
03:41:02.950 --> 03:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh Coast provides door-to-door service
 
03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
for people with qualifying disabilities
 
03:41:07.429 --> 03:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh demand for that service has increased
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
nearly 900% to since 2008
 
03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
and now represents and that's also a 7
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
750 increase in coasts costs to provide
 
03:41:17.160 --> 03:41:18.229 align:start position:0%
750 increase in coasts costs to provide
that

03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:21.189 --> 03:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
service uh services like C&amp;J inter city
 
03:41:23.590 --> 03:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
bus and Amtrak down Easter have since
 
03:41:25.590 --> 03:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
recovered from the pandemic and provide
 
03:41:28.110 --> 03:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
a uh provide a vital link to Urban and
 
03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
economic centers in neighboring Maine
 
03:41:30.399 --> 03:41:32.550 align:start position:0%
economic centers in neighboring Maine
and

03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts last couple of points I'm
 
03:41:37.349 --> 03:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
probably over time my apologies um just
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
thinking of economic linkages uh Coast
 
03:41:41.550 --> 03:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
also operate uh their operations are
 
03:41:44.910 --> 03:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for $25.8 million in
 
03:41:47.149 --> 03:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
economic benefits to the southeast to
 
03:41:48.990 --> 03:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
Southeast New Hampshire according to a
 
03:41:50.990 --> 03:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
study that um me and my colleagues at
 
03:41:52.510 --> 03:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Planning Commission conducted
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago uh we heard
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
directly from restaurant and hotel
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
owners who told us that they would not
 
03:41:59.550 --> 03:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
be in Business Without public transit
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
for their
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
employees uh last L uh housing
 
03:42:05.070 --> 03:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
affordability and transportation are
 
03:42:07.389 --> 03:42:07.399 align:start position:0%
directly linked in the straford region
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
families are having to travel farther
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
from employment centers to find housing
 
03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
that they can afford and I'm not talking
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
about lowincome housing per se I'm
 
03:42:17.910 --> 03:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
talking about families with too stable
 
03:42:20.189 --> 03:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
income uh incomes who are struggling to
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
find affordable rent let alone by a
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
house um this also impacts impacts
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
employers as prospective employees are
 
03:42:30.030 --> 03:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
driven farther away by Rising housing
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
costs and public transportation plays a
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
key role in providing a link between
 
03:42:37.189 --> 03:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
housing and employment
 
03:42:44.030 --> 03:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
all of the projects that you spoke of
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
before you went to your uh handout are
 
03:42:51.070 --> 03:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
they all mentioned in that handout that
 
03:42:53.630 --> 03:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
you gave us okay thank you that the the
 
03:42:55.469 --> 03:42:55.479 align:start position:0%
remarks in the the handout are much
 
03:42:58.110 --> 03:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
longer than my already for both comments
 
03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
so sounds good are there are there
 
03:43:02.149 --> 03:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
gentlemen seeing none oh I'm sorry
 
03:43:08.469 --> 03:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and thanks
 
03:43:10.990 --> 03:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you tell me
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
if the ridership and coast and others
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
has been increasing or decreasing or
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
staying the same for the past say five
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
years it has I'll there are folks from
 
03:43:23.469 --> 03:43:23.479 align:start position:0%
coast who can speak to specific numbers
 
03:43:25.229 --> 03:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
better than I but the last numbers I saw
 
03:43:28.189 --> 03:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
that they're back to 80% of their pre
 
03:43:31.030 --> 03:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic ridership so it has rebounded
 
03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
um that's it's still essential for for
 
03:43:36.830 --> 03:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
employment and um medical trips people
 
03:43:39.630 --> 03:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
getting to school um and it I think it
 
03:43:42.309 --> 03:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
re rebounded faster than other services
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
like like Amtrak and C&amp;J Bus thank you
 
03:43:48.189 --> 03:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
represent Newton further questions
 
03:43:55.990 --> 03:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:02.030 --> 03:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
all next would be uh Michael barot bar
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
that was pretty close uh from the um
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
you're representing the town of Durham
 
03:44:11.830 --> 03:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
welcome sir to public works thank you
 
03:44:14.309 --> 03:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
I'm Michael Baron the town planner for
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham um good afternoon Mr
 
03:44:19.990 --> 03:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee and um
 
03:44:22.189 --> 03:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
some old friends from Rochester I'm
 
03:44:25.590 --> 03:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
pleased to see I will be very quick as
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
um Colin lent um uh kindly mentioned
 
03:44:31.349 --> 03:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
there's just um the one one item in the
 
03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
tenear plan that I would encourage you
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
to just take another look at a a detail
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
um the there's a the Bennett Road Bridge
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
in dur is a um crosses O is a key road
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it crosses over uh a rail a railroad
 
03:44:50.790 --> 03:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
and um this is a maximum of 10 tons
 
03:44:53.070 --> 03:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
which does not allow most of our uh
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
major public works equipment plow trucks
 
03:44:58.349 --> 03:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
fire trucks our Solid Waste trucks and
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
as Colin said it's it's really an issue
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
of wastefulness and inefficiency and
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
potentially a safety issue because it it
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
really affects our response time to a
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
significant uh part part of the town and
 
03:45:13.990 --> 03:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
um originally this was scheduled for
 
03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
construction in 20
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
2026 and that has been at the moment
 
03:45:20.950 --> 03:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
pushed back two years to
 
03:45:25.389 --> 03:45:25.399 align:start position:0%
2028 so I would simply um request and
 
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
urge you if at all possible to move the
 
03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
construction date back two years to the
 
03:45:31.279 --> 03:45:33.469 align:start position:0%
construction date back two years to the
original

03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:45:36.910 --> 03:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
2026 thank you um I have a question if I

please pardon my nervousness um I just
 
03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to take a few minutes of your
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
time and explain to you what the
 
03:46:46.990 --> 03:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
mobility manager network has been able
 
03:46:49.630 --> 03:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
to accomplish in just the past two years
 
03:46:52.229 --> 03:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
we were lucky enough to receive funding
 
03:46:56.269 --> 03:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
with um our CDC DHHS partners and uh
 
03:46:58.349 --> 03:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
they helped to implement the mobility
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
manager Network in the state of New
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so now we have eight Regional
 
03:47:04.590 --> 03:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
Mobility managers and myself as the
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
State Mobility manager so every part of
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
the state is is uh covered with a
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
Mobility manager they work very closely
 
03:47:12.750 --> 03:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
with their Regional coordinating
 
03:47:14.590 --> 03:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
councils and the regional planning
 
03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
commissions um what mainly what we do is
 
03:47:20.149 --> 03:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
we help find Transportation options for
 
03:47:22.349 --> 03:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
the residents of New Hampshire um and
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
these Transportation options as you all
 
03:47:26.349 --> 03:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
know there's there are many gaps within
 
03:47:28.189 --> 03:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire what we try
 
03:47:30.870 --> 03:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
to do is find the best option for that
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
person um it could be public
 
03:47:34.750 --> 03:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
transportation it could be a volunteer
 
03:47:36.910 --> 03:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
driver program maybe the the resident
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
has PTSD and can't use public transit or
 
03:47:42.670 --> 03:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
maybe P public transit just isn't um in
 
03:47:45.510 --> 03:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
their area so we do a lot of that we
 
03:47:47.229 --> 03:47:47.239 align:start position:0%
also reach out to a lot of our partners
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders and we try and fill
 
03:47:50.830 --> 03:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
those gaps in
 
03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
transportation um in the past two years
 
03:47:55.750 --> 03:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
we probably have gone to over a thousand
 
03:47:58.670 --> 03:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
Outreach events within the state um I
 
03:48:00.429 --> 03:48:00.439 align:start position:0%
work with State stakeholders with
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:48:04.469 --> 03:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Education veteran services
 
03:48:07.349 --> 03:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
and we try and fill those gaps in
 
03:48:09.710 --> 03:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
transportation um so thank you very much
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
for the additional funding that you've
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
been able to give the transportation
 
03:48:14.670 --> 03:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
resources because with the additional
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
funding we are able to expand
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
Services um and that's just helping the
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
residents in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:48:24.149 --> 03:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
so I feel like I have a lot more I want
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
to say but right now it's just uh I
 
03:48:29.309 --> 03:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
can't find the words so no thank you um
 
03:48:31.550 --> 03:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
and for a lady that said she was nervous
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
she did perfectly fine thank you very
 
03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
much um may I may do you have any
 
03:48:38.670 --> 03:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony you could uh email or
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
share or send to the committee
 
03:48:43.269 --> 03:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
explaining your program yes if you could
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful yep any any
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
other questions for M Palmer yes
 
03:48:49.990 --> 03:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
represent B thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:48:51.429 --> 03:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your te testimony Miss
 
03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
Palmer um can you just briefly talk
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
about some of your challenges as
 
03:48:59.550 --> 03:48:59.560 align:start position:0%
administrator as it relates to Coos
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
Carol Grafton and Sullivan County which
 
03:49:04.830 --> 03:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
I imagine become very problematic with
 
03:49:07.510 --> 03:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the limited limited options regarding
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation as opposed to to places
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
like Hillsboro Strafford Rockingham
 
03:49:14.990 --> 03:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
marac where there a little bit there's a
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more diversity and more
 
03:49:19.110 --> 03:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
population to make accommodations
 
03:49:22.269 --> 03:49:22.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely um um and based on on what
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned too we have a lot of
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
rural areas in those areas that you just
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned as well so um in fact we've
 
03:49:30.590 --> 03:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
been working on trying to find
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
transportation for where uh New
 
03:49:35.950 --> 03:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um in the North country you
 
03:49:39.309 --> 03:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
know um it's they are very diverse and
 
03:49:42.030 --> 03:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
in the way where they don't feel that
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
they they need Transportation so when we
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
do Outreach events and when we go to
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
senior centers and we talk to them about
 
03:49:50.429 --> 03:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
Transportation options that we could
 
03:49:52.590 --> 03:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
possibly bring into the area they're
 
03:49:54.269 --> 03:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
kind of like oh that's that's really
 
03:49:57.790 --> 03:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
cool um but they're not
 
03:50:00.429 --> 03:50:00.439 align:start position:0%
really it's it's hard because right now
 
03:50:02.229 --> 03:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
like Tri count Transit they're waiting
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
on buses they can't hire drivers without
 
03:50:07.269 --> 03:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
buses they can't expand without funding
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
so once they do start to expand and they
 
03:50:11.469 --> 03:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
are able to bring Transportation options
 
03:50:12.830 --> 03:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
into the area I think you're going to
 
03:50:14.550 --> 03:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
see a lot more people using public
 
03:50:17.070 --> 03:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
transit um it is very difficult when you
 
03:50:19.110 --> 03:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
don't have taxi services volunteer
 
03:50:21.429 --> 03:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
driver programs or anything to really
 
03:50:23.349 --> 03:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
show the benefit of Transportation in
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
those areas um we have been working with
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
the Sullivan County right now with um
 
03:50:30.670 --> 03:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
they've got some great things going on
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
with their Amtrak airport uh their
 
03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
airports being renovated so we're
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
talking to them about Transportation
 
03:50:38.429 --> 03:50:38.439 align:start position:0%
back and forth to the airport so these
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
are all conversations that continue day
 
03:50:43.149 --> 03:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
in and day out so we've got some
 
03:50:44.910 --> 03:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation projects happening in the
 
03:50:46.429 --> 03:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
manad region they're looking at a
 
03:50:48.269 --> 03:50:48.279 align:start position:0%
different Transportation model so that
 
03:50:49.990 --> 03:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
way they can expand
 
03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
Transportation um we're talking to folks
 
03:50:54.269 --> 03:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
in the Plymouth area to see what we can
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
do in to do there um yeah so there's
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on so thank you very
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
much for the funding to keep this where
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
it going thank you he further questions
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you Mr chair Tim jurus
 
03:51:13.510 --> 03:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
did do you does the system offer
 
03:51:16.830 --> 03:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
individual rides from from from singular
 
03:51:20.229 --> 03:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
addresses as well as you know a typical
 
03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
bus or van or a shuttle yep so what the
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
mobility manager network does is we're
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
not actually an agency we're not a
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
transportation agency we work very
 
03:51:30.910 --> 03:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
closely with all of our providers we um
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
all of the mobility managers know all
 
03:51:34.950 --> 03:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
the transportation options whether
 
03:51:37.469 --> 03:51:37.479 align:start position:0%
they're for-profit nonprofit and they
 
03:51:39.309 --> 03:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
will find the best resource for them
 
03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
them um the the mobility managers do
 
03:51:43.870 --> 03:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
great if they're going from one region
 
03:51:46.229 --> 03:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
to another region or if they if they
 
03:51:48.309 --> 03:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
have uh Transportation needs outside of
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
the state they they know about all the
 
03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
you know Dartmouth Coach and and so on
 
03:51:55.790 --> 03:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth so they they work amongst
 
03:51:56.670 --> 03:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
themselves to find the best
 
03:51:56.680 --> 03:51:59.790 align:start position:0%
themselves to find the best
transportation

03:51:59.790 --> 03:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
option yes represent vone thank you Mr
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
question um obviously there's a need and
 
03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're trying to fulfill um in
 
03:52:12.790 --> 03:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
your your written comments to us do you
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
include kind of a data piece in regards
 
03:52:17.189 --> 03:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
to what the needs are based by you know
 
03:52:19.269 --> 03:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
region by demographics and so on do we
 
03:52:20.349 --> 03:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
are we going to get something to look at
 
03:52:23.550 --> 03:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
that just so we can kind of gauge how
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
what kind of resource you know are we
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
matching the resources with the need
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely so you're looking for where
 
03:52:31.630 --> 03:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
we already cover transportation and
 
03:52:33.550 --> 03:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
where the gaps
 
03:52:36.870 --> 03:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
are yeah that would I think in terms of
 
03:52:39.149 --> 03:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
matching services to need but also I
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know if you've got that
 
03:52:42.269 --> 03:52:42.279 align:start position:0%
kind of information or or anyone's
 
03:52:43.710 --> 03:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
providing that just in terms of like how
 
03:52:45.309 --> 03:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
many people are sitting out there and
 
03:52:47.429 --> 03:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
they're not going places because you
 
03:52:48.990 --> 03:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
know they've they've got hospital visits
 
03:52:50.349 --> 03:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
to go or they've got they have
 
03:52:52.110 --> 03:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
appointments to go
 
03:52:54.750 --> 03:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
to what how what's the the depth of the
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
need and I don't know if that study has
 
03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
been done or or what you might have but
 
03:53:00.630 --> 03:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would would
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
definitely help to inform decisionmakers
 
03:53:05.790 --> 03:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
like us uh as to what kind of resources
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
should be going that direction well
 
03:53:09.790 --> 03:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for bringing that up
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
there's actually uh we are waiting for
 
03:53:14.349 --> 03:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
funding to come through for our needs
 
03:53:16.389 --> 03:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
assessment um and with that needs
 
03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
assessment that will give us the data
 
03:53:19.830 --> 03:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for as far as you
 
03:53:22.269 --> 03:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
know where are the gaps what are what
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
are uh residents wanting do they want
 
03:53:26.670 --> 03:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
another volunteer driver program do they
 
03:53:28.950 --> 03:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
want microtransit do they want public
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
transit um you know so yes if if you
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
happen to see or hear any of the the
 
03:53:38.349 --> 03:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
needs assessment talk um we definitely
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
need that to to to move
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
forward yeah followup so that and that's
 
03:53:45.670 --> 03:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
great because I think that's just the
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
kind of information that we would could
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
so do you have a timeline as to when
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
that needs assessment or are you you're
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
waiting on the money so that you can
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
actually do it
 
03:53:56.910 --> 03:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
right yeah I think Steve's gonna speak
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
to that in just a little bit so great
 
03:54:00.910 --> 03:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm looking forward to it
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you thank you Mr
 
03:54:03.269 --> 03:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
chairman any further
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh we will bring up
 
03:54:12.389 --> 03:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
Steve is it Workman yes
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you very
 
03:54:27.910 --> 03:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
much uh for allowing me to talk with you
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
this afternoon uh my name is Steve
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
Workman and I'm the director of
 
03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
Transport New Hampshire I also serve on
 
03:54:35.710 --> 03:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
the leadership team as treasur for the
 
03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide um Community SEC so the state
 
03:54:41.149 --> 03:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
coord ordinating Council for Community
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation so I think I want to
 
03:54:45.790 --> 03:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
deviate because the subject of the needs
 
03:54:48.269 --> 03:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
assessment came up so let me just tackle
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
that now so it doesn't get lost so as my
 
03:54:53.910 --> 03:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
colleague Terry said um we do have a
 
03:54:57.189 --> 03:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
plan uh it's a proposal that we uh
 
03:54:58.710 --> 03:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
submitted to the governor's office
 
03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
specifically through Gopher for the arpa
 
03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
funds and we submitted that uh two years
 
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
ago this coming August and at the time
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
as you probably are aware the governor's
 
03:55:09.790 --> 03:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
office and gopher have been working
 
03:55:11.189 --> 03:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
through the state's priorities and how
 
03:55:13.870 --> 03:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
to effectively use that money so at this
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
point in time that has remained in the
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
mix um recently in December the governor
 
03:55:20.309 --> 03:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
was able to connect with a lot of uh
 
03:55:22.710 --> 03:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
constituents uh who spoke about the need
 
03:55:25.149 --> 03:55:25.159 align:start position:0%
and how they can't get to basic Services
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
basic social uh outings and this really
 
03:55:30.670 --> 03:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
drove the point home that I think you
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
were getting at uh
 
03:55:35.149 --> 03:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative in that he saw that there
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
is an unmet need out there and the light
 
03:55:39.110 --> 03:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
bulb went off in his head that on the
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
corner of his desk is a proposal to do
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
this so This Statewide needs assessment
 
03:55:45.630 --> 03:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
would be arpa funded if we're successful
 
03:55:47.349 --> 03:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
and it would engage our regional
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
planning commissions our Mobility
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
management Network um we're hoping to
 
03:55:52.590 --> 03:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
engage New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
Institute UNH Survey Center to do a
 
03:55:57.950 --> 03:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look the first of its kind
 
03:56:00.269 --> 03:56:00.279 align:start position:0%
for the entire State because I think the
 
03:56:02.189 --> 03:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
point that you were trying to make is if
 
03:56:04.030 --> 03:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have real data we are Flying
 
03:56:06.750 --> 03:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
Blind and so where is the actual um
 
03:56:08.229 --> 03:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
Strategic investment and what we're
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
doing giving we don't have endless
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
amounts of funds so definitely any
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
leverage to help us get across that we
 
03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
think that'll be about a 12-month
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
process but we feel like we will come
 
03:56:22.110 --> 03:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
back with solid Baseline data not just
 
03:56:24.830 --> 03:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
the anecdotal stories which are
 
03:56:27.070 --> 03:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
important so I'll move on unless
 
03:56:28.469 --> 03:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to speak to that right
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
now why don't why don't we we have a lot
 
03:56:32.349 --> 03:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
of people to speak yeah that's what I
 
03:56:36.269 --> 03:56:36.279 align:start position:0%
fig so I want to suggest in in my job I
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
U I work in the spaces in between I
 
03:56:40.229 --> 03:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
don't do any direct service so I'm
 
03:56:42.149 --> 03:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
working with State agencies our
 
03:56:44.309 --> 03:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
providers in the transportation World
 
03:56:47.389 --> 03:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
providers in healthare you name it local
 
03:56:49.229 --> 03:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
government County government and the
 
03:56:52.030 --> 03:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
federal government and what I try to do
 
03:56:54.750 --> 03:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
is find ways to bring people together so
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
that we can find common Solutions and
 
03:56:58.590 --> 03:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
shared resources to address some of the
 
03:57:00.910 --> 03:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
most vexing problems that actually go
 
03:57:03.990 --> 03:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
across all of our state agencies I it's
 
03:57:05.830 --> 03:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
no surprise to all of you that we often
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
have to operate in a silo because
 
03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
there's just so much work to do the
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
problem is that comes with a cost it
 
03:57:13.510 --> 03:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
means we're missing opportunities if you
 
03:57:15.710 --> 03:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
go back to the federal level you're
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
going to see that the federal government
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
has made changes through something
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
called the coordinating Council on
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
access and Mobility this is under FTA
 
03:57:26.710 --> 03:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
but it brings together federal agencies
 
03:57:29.590 --> 03:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
who all have a portion of transportation
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
services and what it's doing is trying
 
03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
to remove the barriers in policy level
 
03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
that prevent us from doing what we know
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
would work and also to increase funding
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
but to encourage from the top down that
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
these agencies are working together gone
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
Goes The Silo sure you have requirements
 
03:57:49.389 --> 03:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
but this is going to lead to a more
 
03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
effective use of this so when you look
 
03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
at the 10-year plan that's in front of
 
03:57:54.870 --> 03:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
you I want to suggest that you're not
 
03:57:56.910 --> 03:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
actually just passing a plan I mean
 
03:57:58.670 --> 03:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
technically you are but what I want to
 
03:58:00.710 --> 03:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
suggest is you're actually creating the
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
environment for this to thrive we have
 
03:58:05.870 --> 03:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
taken the Investments which you have
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
provided to us both in the budget last
 
03:58:10.510 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
year as a bipartisan and increase um the
 
03:58:12.189 --> 03:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
money that Terry mentioned which was
 
03:58:14.429 --> 03:58:14.439 align:start position:0%
part of a federal covid disparity Grant
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
we use $3 million to build our capacity
 
03:58:18.750 --> 03:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
those Grant funds and that project ends
 
03:58:21.469 --> 03:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
in may we have built the capacity and I
 
03:58:23.149 --> 03:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
feel that my colleagues and I have
 
03:58:25.429 --> 03:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that with an investment on
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
your part we are able to do the
 
03:58:30.429 --> 03:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
groundwork so that we can address the
 
03:58:32.469 --> 03:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
North Country which has very specific
 
03:58:34.590 --> 03:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
issues the large geography makes it hard
 
03:58:36.309 --> 03:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
to compare that with our more urban
 
03:58:39.030 --> 03:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
centers where there are more population
 
03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
we know things are different in New
 
03:58:42.750 --> 03:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you're going to create that
 
03:58:44.910 --> 03:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
that environment and let's remember what
 
03:58:46.910 --> 03:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
the investment and transportation in
 
03:58:49.750 --> 03:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
total is doing it is providing a boost
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
to our economy we know that that
 
03:58:53.469 --> 03:58:53.479 align:start position:0%
transportation is literally the
 
03:58:55.790 --> 03:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
circulatory system for most everything
 
03:58:58.149 --> 03:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
we do so this is an opportunity to make
 
03:59:00.870 --> 03:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
sure that we can get people to work and
 
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
citizens into those businesses to buy
 
03:59:05.790 --> 03:59:05.800 align:start position:0%
the goods and services that they need we
 
03:59:07.349 --> 03:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
also know that transportation is at the
 
03:59:09.269 --> 03:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
center of Housing and that is a high
 
03:59:11.710 --> 03:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
priority right now for this state we
 
03:59:13.630 --> 03:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
know that health care we have a problem
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
with missed appointments or simply I
 
03:59:17.309 --> 03:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
can't schedule it because I can't get
 
03:59:20.670 --> 03:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
there and so in that environment we have
 
03:59:23.110 --> 03:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
physical health mental health but then
 
03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
there's something else we've brought
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
into our transportation discussion and
 
03:59:28.349 --> 03:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
that's called social determinants of
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
health or vital conditions this is what
 
03:59:34.110 --> 03:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
makes our our communities Thrive and
 
03:59:36.790 --> 03:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's what allows individuals to age in
 
03:59:39.790 --> 03:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
place and to meet the basic needs that
 
03:59:41.710 --> 03:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
they do we understand that social
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
determents of Health social activities
 
03:59:46.149 --> 03:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
are critical for older adults isolation
 
03:59:48.429 --> 03:59:48.439 align:start position:0%
is a leading cause of death or a
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
decrease in aptitude and ability level
 
03:59:52.870 --> 03:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
these are things that we want to be at
 
03:59:54.950 --> 03:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
the table with all of you and our
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
partners to fix and we feel that when
 
03:59:58.990 --> 03:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
you make an investment in the 10-year
 
04:00:01.110 --> 04:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
plan and in the budget process to
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
support us we can do good things with
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
that so I'll close my thoughts by just
 
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
saying if you can continue to support
 
04:00:11.710 --> 04:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
work with us provide us the finances we
 
04:00:14.110 --> 04:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
promise you we will work on the data and

this morning that uh is quite a bit
 
04:02:15.550 --> 04:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
broader than what I wanted to talk about
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
today which is really the economic
 
04:02:19.349 --> 04:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
impacts of public transportation and
 
04:02:19.359 --> 04:02:20.389 align:start position:0%
impacts of public transportation and
Community

04:02:23.070 --> 04:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation um public and Community
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation oper access to
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity which which uh drives the
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
economy and supports communities uh when
 
04:02:32.590 --> 04:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents can access jobs
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
education and the services they need to
 
04:02:36.750 --> 04:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
succeed they make a positive
 
04:02:38.349 --> 04:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
contribution to their communities into
 
04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
to the state economy yet transportation
 
04:02:45.030 --> 04:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
is often the missing missing link um
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
public and Community Transportation
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
providers connect people and their
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
Community serving as vital partners for
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
business Education Health Care and

Social Services across the state public
 
04:02:57.990 --> 04:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
and Community transportation's Statewide
 
04:03:00.429 --> 04:03:00.439 align:start position:0%
economic impact is estimated in excess
 
04:03:04.830 --> 04:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
of $95 million annually uh for every $1
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh invested in public and Community
 
04:03:09.710 --> 04:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation the estimated uh effects
 
04:03:13.469 --> 04:03:13.479 align:start position:0%
on on the E on economic activity are are
 
04:03:17.389 --> 04:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
$4 so it's a 4 to1 return an investment
 
04:03:19.149 --> 04:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
in our work is an investment in the
 
04:03:21.630 --> 04:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
economic growth and competitiveness of
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's local Regional and
 
04:03:23.199 --> 04:03:24.389 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's local Regional and
Statewide

04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
economies State uh investment in public
 
04:03:29.070 --> 04:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
transportation unlocks at least a
 
04:03:31.469 --> 04:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
onetoone federal match uh via the
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan infrastructure law or the iig
 
04:03:38.149 --> 04:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
and up to 4 to one if uh funding is is
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used uh for any eligible
 
04:03:43.870 --> 04:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
Federal Transit Administration operating
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
expense so it has uh very it's very
 
04:03:49.630 --> 04:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
powerful uh what state funding can do
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
for us for small urban and rural areas
 
04:03:54.189 --> 04:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
with public and Community Transportation
 
04:03:56.510 --> 04:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire these areas are quite
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
successful uh and um are providing high
 
04:04:02.590 --> 04:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
quality and highly sought Services as
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation providers we're doing the
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
very best we can with relatively limited
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
resources that we have but we could do
 
04:04:12.750 --> 04:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
so much more um in the last year uh New
 
04:04:15.229 --> 04:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dot leadership uh leaders in
 
04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
the executive Council house senate our
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
counties cities towns and now the
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
governor's office through his
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
transmittal letter of the 10-year plan
 
04:04:24.990 --> 04:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
have been actively advocating for higher
 
04:04:27.990 --> 04:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
investments in public and Community
 
04:04:30.030 --> 04:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation the funding increases
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
secured this bium while not what the the
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Transit Association and
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
our members had requested were
 
04:04:37.120 --> 04:04:38.830 align:start position:0%
our members had requested were
unprecedented

04:04:38.830 --> 04:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
 
04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
um we are incredibly thankful for that
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
support and know that this will result
 
04:04:45.630 --> 04:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
in tens of thousands of additional hours
 
04:04:48.110 --> 04:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
of service hundreds of thousands of
 
04:04:50.510 --> 04:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
miles and hundreds of thousands of
 
04:04:50.520 --> 04:04:51.590 align:start position:0%
miles and hundreds of thousands of
additional

04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:04:54.750 --> 04:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
rides um so there are there very
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
positive consequences as a result of
 
04:04:56.720 --> 04:04:57.550 align:start position:0%
positive consequences as a result of
that

04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:00.269 --> 04:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
investment um I I will say though
 
04:05:02.910 --> 04:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's at least one uh public
 
04:05:05.469 --> 04:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
transit related project uh that did not
 
04:05:08.149 --> 04:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
Advance uh in the 10-year plan coming
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
out of the governor's office that's
 
04:05:12.550 --> 04:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
unh's project uh it's quite unfortunate
 
04:05:15.189 --> 04:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
that because it is a a very worthy
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
public transit project uh that uh was
 
04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
removed um I'll close with the realities
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
we face as providers uh primarily a
 
04:05:29.710 --> 04:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
shifting uh Federal funding landscape
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
and inflation means that without
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
additional investments in our systems

please and thank you for taking my uh
 
04:07:15.790 --> 04:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
question so you referenced a a project
 
04:07:17.229 --> 04:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
in the plan do you know what the what
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
the project name or number
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
is uh so my comments are are more
 
04:07:27.189 --> 04:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
General in nature uh regarding uh State
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
support for public transit Coast has
 
04:07:32.149 --> 04:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
probably two or three projects in the
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
plan uh that we we are happy with uh and
 
04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
then there's program programmatics in
 
04:07:43.349 --> 04:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
the plan that uh are largely dictated by
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
federal funding coming into the state so
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're in support of of the
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
plan as it sits thank you thank you um
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
if if I could for the representative UNH
 
04:07:54.790 --> 04:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
has a representative that's going to
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
speak so perhaps they could shed some
 
04:07:59.229 --> 04:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
light to that if not we can ask we can
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
ask the department thank you thank you

welcome to Public Works representing U
 
04:08:19.710 --> 04:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
Wentworth by the Sea homeowners

Newcastle and I'm on the homeowners
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
association board for the Wentworth by
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
the Sea uh
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
development the uh the I'm speaking
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to the 1B Causeway uh
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
section of the plan um there are two
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
ways to get on and off the island or the
 
04:08:45.950 --> 04:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
islands known as Newcastle one of them
 
04:08:48.429 --> 04:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
is the causeway which seems to get quite
 
04:08:50.189 --> 04:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
you know quite a bit of press That's
 
04:08:53.070 --> 04:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
What goes along into into Portsmouth the
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
other side is um there's a drawbridge
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
between Newcastle and rye and uh on the
 
04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
Rye side of the uh of Wentworth road
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
which is 1B there is a significant dip
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
in the road
 
04:09:10.429 --> 04:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh to the point where that was shut down
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
both the sto by the storms in December
 
04:09:17.389 --> 04:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
the storm right before Christmas and uh
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
traffic was not allowed through there in
 
04:09:21.309 --> 04:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
either of the January
 
04:09:26.349 --> 04:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
storms so my question is that there are
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
two Jetties one from Odon Point State
 
04:09:34.109 --> 04:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
Park and one from Fort Stark that are by
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
definition of a jetty are supposed to
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:38.229 align:start position:0%
definition of a jetty are supposed to
provide

04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
um a a leveling or an evening of the
 
04:09:45.030 --> 04:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
waves and the and the tides that come in
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
and out of Little Harbor so last
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
Saturday when the astronomical High
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
Tides were um were uh uh what's the word
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
in play um that I walked over to the
 
04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
bridge and walked over to that dip I
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
could not see either of the Jetties the
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
water was coming
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
over those Jetties to the point where
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
there was there was almost no Ripple
 
04:10:15.630 --> 04:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
even the water was coming so high over
 
04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
those Jetties so my question is does the
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
1B project um in any way address the
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
Jetties because at least my
 
04:10:30.790 --> 04:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is I'm not a scientist I'm
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
I'm a homeowner um but my understanding
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
is that the Jetties will do a lot
 
04:10:39.670 --> 04:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
to help the inflow and outflow and the
 
04:10:42.030 --> 04:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
rate of it so that we won't have the
 
04:10:45.870 --> 04:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
ponding issue that exists on 1B and I
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
just am not I haven't I have don't
 
04:10:49.950 --> 04:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
understand enough to know whether the
 
04:10:53.670 --> 04:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
Jetties are being um considered or any
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
if if they're even U you know how often
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
the an engineer goes out and takes a
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
look at them or anything I I that's
 
04:11:03.950 --> 04:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
really my question um I I thank you for
 
04:11:06.189 --> 04:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
that I my my first response is well
 
04:11:08.109 --> 04:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
number one thank you for being here
 
04:11:10.670 --> 04:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh number two the um have you spoken to
 
04:11:13.469 --> 04:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
the department about this or are you
 
04:11:16.149 --> 04:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
bringing this issue first to us it um it
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
was raised um at um Janet Stevens um
 
04:11:23.469 --> 04:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
Regional meetings that were held um last
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
fall and um there was there was concern
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
because the where the dip is is is
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
private property one side it's the
 
04:11:33.750 --> 04:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
Wentworth by the SE Wentworth Country
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
Club and the other side are our
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
homeowners and so uh um but that clearly
 
04:11:42.830 --> 04:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
would be an issue um that if there is
 
04:11:45.109 --> 04:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
going to be the causeway worked on if
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
the dip on the other side isn't
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
addressed we still may have issues in
 
04:11:52.149 --> 04:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
terms of access on and off thank you do
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%

04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
response from us uh no why don't you go
 
04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%

04:13:29.590 --> 04:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
commercial use supermarkets gas stations
 
04:13:31.630 --> 04:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
plus two municipal
 
04:13:35.070 --> 04:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
projects the list also shows projects
 
04:13:37.510 --> 04:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
not approved which includes includes a
 
04:13:41.109 --> 04:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
dairy Municipal project for about a $1
 
04:13:44.189 --> 04:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
million applications for electric
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging stations CMAC fundings
 
04:13:49.950 --> 04:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
were requested in the first quarter of
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
last year via the
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
DOT der's first application in January
 
04:13:59.309 --> 04:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
was for 1.5 million which do then
 
04:14:02.670 --> 04:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
requested to be modified in February
 
04:14:05.790 --> 04:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
2023 to remove any electric
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles all right application was
 
04:14:10.349 --> 04:14:10.359 align:start position:0%
resubmitted in March to dot with the
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles removed for a total project
 
04:14:15.750 --> 04:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
cost of about $1
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
million from the list of projects in the
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
10year plan New Hampshire do used the
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
wrong submission to eliminate Dairy from
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
funding theot claims that they were we
 
04:14:30.510 --> 04:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
were eliminated because we included
 
04:14:32.109 --> 04:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
funding we had contacted do to correct
 
04:14:37.630 --> 04:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
their analysis but did not re receive a
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
response until January 19th
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
2024 in which they conceded that they
 
04:14:46.030 --> 04:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
used the wrong submission from
 
04:14:49.389 --> 04:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
Derry uh dot directed der to address
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
this Omission via the legislative branch
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
which we are doing
 
04:14:56.349 --> 04:14:56.359 align:start position:0%
today in summary Not only was Derry
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
improperly disqualified using the wrong
 
04:15:01.710 --> 04:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
submission but as you can see from the
 
04:15:03.309 --> 04:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
list preference has been given to
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
commercial projects versus
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
municipal we strongly believe that tax
 
04:15:10.950 --> 04:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
dollars spent should be prioritized
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
toward direct benefit to the taxpayers
 
04:15:16.830 --> 04:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
that being Municipal projects versus
 
04:15:19.070 --> 04:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
subsidizing commercial projects that may
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
or may not
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
fail uh this testimony is along along
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the list of projects was submitted
 
04:15:28.389 --> 04:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
electronically last
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
week thank you Mr Paul if if I could ask
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
a question on the committee so tell me
 
04:15:37.469 --> 04:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
uh I understand the commercial the um
 
04:15:40.830 --> 04:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
the stores the gas uh and I believe you
 
04:15:42.910 --> 04:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
said there were two municipal that were
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
approved in the package 8 and2 what what
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
are the what's the scope of these
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal Chargers that were not put in
 
04:15:53.469 --> 04:15:53.479 align:start position:0%
they're similar to the uh commercial
 
04:15:56.790 --> 04:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
projects it's a mix of uh high-speed
 
04:15:59.910 --> 04:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
charging uh stations as well as level
 
04:16:02.670 --> 04:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
two well I understand that sir but where
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
where were you looking to have
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
those let's see and gorm no I take that
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
back are they I'm just trying to get a
 
04:16:15.550 --> 04:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
feel for are these Town Offices maybe
 
04:16:17.429 --> 04:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
you could categorize them for me the
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
ones that we are requesting yes the
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
additional ones yeah these are three
 
04:16:24.750 --> 04:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
locations within Dairy one is at the
 
04:16:27.389 --> 04:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
Public Works location which is near
 
04:16:30.910 --> 04:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
93 the other one is at the U um
 
04:16:33.070 --> 04:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
municipal building which is right near
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
downtown less than a mile from exit 4
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
and then the other one is near the
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
police station which is going to be
 
04:16:43.229 --> 04:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
probably a half mile within the new exit
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
4A okay thank you further questions
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
represent Faulkner thank you for taking
 
04:16:51.790 --> 04:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
the question clarify for me the these
 
04:16:54.429 --> 04:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
charging stations to qualify for funds
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
do they need to be open to the general
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
public or are they for the use of the
 
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
employees or whatever of the sporing
 
04:17:04.710 --> 04:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
organization so the intent for the town
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
of dairy is to introduce electric
 
04:17:09.269 --> 04:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles into their Fleet at at their
 
04:17:12.109 --> 04:17:12.119 align:start position:0%
expense over time as electric vehicles
 
04:17:15.109 --> 04:17:15.119 align:start position:0%
are suitable for Town
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
uses um so
 
04:17:22.590 --> 04:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
that um the money here would be used to
 
04:17:24.590 --> 04:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
to develop the infrastructure to support
 
04:17:28.269 --> 04:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
our own electric vehicle Fleet but the
 
04:17:31.229 --> 04:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh the stations were intended to VI used
 
04:17:34.750 --> 04:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
for Town usage but they could be open
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
for public If U if there was is a demand
 
04:17:37.600 --> 04:17:38.389 align:start position:0%
for public If U if there was is a demand
for

04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
it thank you further
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
questions sir thank you for your time
 
04:17:44.840 --> 04:17:48.750 align:start position:0%
questions sir thank you for your time
thank

04:17:48.750 --> 04:17:48.760 align:start position:0%

unh

04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon uh chairman makoni and
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
members of the public works and highways
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Bill Janelle I'm
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
the associate vice president of
 
04:18:21.070 --> 04:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
facilities and operations at UNH uh and
 
04:18:23.229 --> 04:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
04:18:23.239 --> 04:18:24.189 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the opportunity to testify
this

04:18:24.189 --> 04:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon um so just a little background
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
so the University of New Hampshire
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
Durham submitted three projects in n in
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
Do's 2223 CMAC round and as you know
 
04:18:39.229 --> 04:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
know uh this program provides 80%
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
Federal support and has been used
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
extensively by UNH over the past two
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
decades to fund essential Transit and
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
transportation infrastructure projects
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
on campus which improved air quality and
 
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh reduce traffic congestion in SE Co
 
04:18:56.830 --> 04:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
region one thing that may not be um
 
04:18:59.710 --> 04:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
evident to to everybody but um so UNH
 
04:19:01.149 --> 04:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
operates one of the largest Transit
 
04:19:04.030 --> 04:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state U but we're unique
 
04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
in that we don't receive formula funds
 
04:19:08.309 --> 04:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
from the federal trans Administration so
 
04:19:10.990 --> 04:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
our system oper system operations are
 
04:19:13.149 --> 04:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
funded by a student transportation fee
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
and campus General funds and therefore
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
UNH relies heavily on programs like
 
04:19:22.670 --> 04:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
CAC um for Capital assistance mainly
 
04:19:26.830 --> 04:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
replacement of buses um and so CAC and
 
04:19:28.269 --> 04:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
other competitive Transit Capital
 
04:19:30.429 --> 04:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
programs like it are essential for our
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
continued operations of the the UNH
 
04:19:32.239 --> 04:19:33.429 align:start position:0%
continued operations of the the UNH
transit

04:19:33.429 --> 04:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
transit
 
04:19:37.030 --> 04:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
system so in this round un had um three
 
04:19:40.349 --> 04:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
projects that were uh that were proposed
 
04:19:42.630 --> 04:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
so the first and our highest priority
 
04:19:44.670 --> 04:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
was the UNH Transit Fleet replacement
 
04:19:47.109 --> 04:19:47.119 align:start position:0%
project that was for $3.8
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
million um and it was intended to
 
04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
replace four
 
04:19:54.670 --> 04:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
buses and we had initially planned for
 
04:19:57.630 --> 04:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh those buses to be two CG buses and
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
two electric
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
buses um second project was a
 
04:20:03.950 --> 04:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
intersection Improvement project so it
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
was at the intersection of 155a Main and
 
04:20:09.109 --> 04:20:09.119 align:start position:0%
Mass road so that's the main entrance to
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
UNH coming into campus and uh that's a
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
$1.2 million project it's still in the
 
04:20:16.109 --> 04:20:16.119 align:start position:0%
plan we very much appreciate that and I
 
04:20:17.790 --> 04:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
believe it's been Advanced a bit as well
 
04:20:20.349 --> 04:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
so very appreciative for that and the
 
04:20:23.389 --> 04:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
third project was a a dur was a com
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
combination of Durham and UNH it was a
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
public EV charging station project for
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
$375,000 and it was for four locations
 
04:20:35.149 --> 04:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
in in downtown Durham and on
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
campus so you un we're very pleased that
 
04:20:41.149 --> 04:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
all three projects were recommended
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
through the CAC round and included in
 
04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
the dot draft of the 10-year plan but
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately two of the three projects
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
so the transit Fleet replacement project
 
04:20:51.870 --> 04:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
and the EV charging project were dropped
 
04:20:54.670 --> 04:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
from the governance final
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
proposal so we're here to request uh
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
restoration of the UNH Transit Fleet
 
04:21:02.670 --> 04:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
funding project which is critical to uh
 
04:21:04.750 --> 04:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
continued reliable operation of our
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
extensive Transit Transit Network and we
 
04:21:09.070 --> 04:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the support from straford
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
Regional and also Coast on this project
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
um and the town of Durham I believe has
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
written testimony um but this request
 
04:21:20.349 --> 04:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
would support replacement of four 15y
 
04:21:23.109 --> 04:21:23.119 align:start position:0%
old full-size transit buses uh so these
 
04:21:25.389 --> 04:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
buses have over 300,000 miles on them
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
and they're well beyond their useful
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
life um the transit consist uh system it
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
consists of the Durham Campus Connector
 
04:21:37.469 --> 04:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
which is mainly in the Durham area
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh and also our regional Wildcat Transit
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
routes which connect Portsmouth and do
 
04:21:44.830 --> 04:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
and the system provides over half a
 
04:21:46.510 --> 04:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
million passenger trips annually in the
 
04:21:49.630 --> 04:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast region the failure of one of
 
04:21:52.030 --> 04:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
one or more of these vehicles impacts
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
reliability and operational cost lacking
 
04:21:57.790 --> 04:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
the capital fund funding support uh
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
reflected in this request the UN transit
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
system faces fiscal challenges which
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
will reduce access to our campus so we
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to support the
 
04:22:08.510 --> 04:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
University's request to protect the
 
04:22:10.269 --> 04:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
operations of our Transit Fleet by
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
restoring support for these four
 
04:22:14.830 --> 04:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles so I just want to talk a little
 
04:22:17.710 --> 04:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
bit about um a little bit about the
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
history and sustainability and what UNH
 
04:22:22.830 --> 04:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
has tried to do in the past so for 25
 
04:22:25.630 --> 04:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
years UNH has had a thoughtful cost
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
effective and successful introduction of
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
clean low emission fuel to our Fleet so
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
this started with uh B um with B20
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
biodiesel in 20 000 we then transitioned
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
to natural gas in 2004 and today the
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
majority of our Fleet is is powered by
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
natural gas so um long-term transitions
 
04:22:52.030 --> 04:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh for those two alternate fuels and in
 
04:22:54.550 --> 04:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
23 we were beginning the planning for an
 
04:22:57.229 --> 04:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
expected again 20-year Transit Fleet
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
transition to electric
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
power and we'd plan to use electricity
 
04:23:05.349 --> 04:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
from unh's landfill gas so we are a bit
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
unique in that we generate our own
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
electricity um and the thought was these
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles would be powered would be
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
charged off peak times and then used uh
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
during the day and there's also
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
additional benefits whereas an electric
 
04:23:21.189 --> 04:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
bus is a large battery and um it could
 
04:23:23.109 --> 04:23:23.119 align:start position:0%
be used for Emergency Operations if
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
there was power outages or things like
 
04:23:25.040 --> 04:23:26.710 align:start position:0%
there was power outages or things like
this

04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:30.750 --> 04:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
um however um with all that said we
 
04:23:32.910 --> 04:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
realized there could be concerns with EV
 
04:23:35.229 --> 04:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles and that it's too early to down
 
04:23:38.269 --> 04:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
that road and we understand that and uh
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
we are quite fine foregoing that uh
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
transition at this time and looking at
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
it at a at a future date and um
 
04:23:49.389 --> 04:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
switching those EVS to CG buses I mean
 
04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is we just need buses to
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
run the system and uh that's That's the
 
04:23:57.870 --> 04:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
basis of the request and that's our
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
priority in coming here today and
 
04:24:02.349 --> 04:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
speaking to you thank you Mr Janelle
 
04:24:04.990 --> 04:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
before I open would you uh be able to
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
provide for the
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
the number of uh buses in your Fleet at
 
04:24:10.920 --> 04:24:11.910 align:start position:0%
the number of uh buses in your Fleet at
another

04:24:11.910 --> 04:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:24:15.269 --> 04:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
time um and uh then break that out by
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
what's still out there for
 
04:24:21.389 --> 04:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
biodiesel and the um Natural Gas and
 
04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
Electric and if I could TR you one more
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
item sure tell me what the replacement
 
04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
cost is for each one of those items yes
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
and if you can just forward that to the
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee that would be helpful and is
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
biodiesel still a
 
04:24:40.349 --> 04:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
viable uh product that meets your
 
04:24:40.359 --> 04:24:41.590 align:start position:0%
viable uh product that meets your
emission

04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
emission
 
04:24:44.269 --> 04:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
goals yes or at least the emission
 
04:24:45.910 --> 04:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
standards that's yes I mean we continue
 
04:24:48.149 --> 04:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
to use biodiesel in in our diesel buses
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
today that would be that would be
 
04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful if you could forward
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
that other questions from Mr Janelle I
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
should be back okay sorry thank you so
 
04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
you B sham
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
Newton thank you Mr shamman thank you
 
04:25:10.030 --> 04:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm glad you
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
brought up that issue about the EVs and
 
04:25:14.590 --> 04:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
maybe willing to hold back on them
 
04:25:16.630 --> 04:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
because we've heard repeatedly that
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of issues with fires and
 
04:25:21.950 --> 04:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
dependability have you let that be known
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
because what I saw here was you wanted
 
04:25:27.070 --> 04:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
four buses two EVs and two of the
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
regulars so have you let that been known
 
04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
to anybody that you'd be happy with four
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the uh efficient buses that don't
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have to be EV
 
04:25:39.309 --> 04:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh other than at this committee no I
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
mean we didn't testify when the 10-year
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
plan came to Durham to that effect um so
 
04:25:46.990 --> 04:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
I would say no not then not other than
 
04:25:49.109 --> 04:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
to this committee followup question yes
 
04:25:52.389 --> 04:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
followup sir thank you um is there is
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
ridership down I happen to go through I
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
I live near UNH anyway and I happen to
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
go through this fall and boy there was a
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
lot of electric scooters a lot of people
 
04:26:04.630 --> 04:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
using those now I didn't expect to see
 
04:26:07.830 --> 04:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
as many as I did is ridership down with
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
the buses as a result of that or is it
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
staying about the same ridership is
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
actually up about 26% from last year oh
 
04:26:16.269 --> 04:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
good I mean it did take a significant
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
dip during covid obviously but um we are
 
04:26:21.630 --> 04:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
we are catching up to get back where we
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
were and again from last year it's up
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
26% thank you thank you please represent
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
jurus thank you Mr chairman regards to
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
the proposed electric uh the battery
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
buses will you was you and planning on
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
installing their own charges for the um
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
for those buses yes that would be again
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
I mean this is a our first transition
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
into this so this would have to be
 
04:26:49.030 --> 04:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
studied uh to determine you know what's
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
the right bus what's the size bus what's
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
the location for the Chargers but we we
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
were planning a dedicated bus charging
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
station um for these EV buses yes which
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
was separate from there was a EV
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
charging project as well um which would
 
04:27:09.309 --> 04:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
be more focused on visitors coming to
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
campus thank you you any other qu yes
 
04:27:15.269 --> 04:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
repres representative Boyd and then
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
fauler thank you Mr chairman I
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate it Mr CH all thank you very
 
04:27:20.830 --> 04:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony question
 
04:27:23.790 --> 04:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
regarding a letter on the Durham UNH
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
public EV charging at a cost of
 
04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
$375,000 was there any discussion
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
between the municipality UNH on Cross
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
collaborating budgets to be able to fund
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
that yourselves independently of the
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
application process um certainly cross
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration with un it was a joint um
 
04:27:46.030 --> 04:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
application with with UNH and Durham uh
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
as far as funding it ourselves I don't I
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe we've uh we've gone down
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
that road yet we've tried to to find
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
federal funds or CAC funds to move this
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
forward thank you very much thank you Mr
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
represent partner thank
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
you in terms of EV buses are there
 
04:28:08.269 --> 04:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in the US EV
 
04:28:10.429 --> 04:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
buses yes it's my understanding there
 
04:28:12.550 --> 04:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
are there's uh I believe there's an EV
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
bus in nashwa and certainly many in
 
04:28:20.429 --> 04:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
other states please follow up and you
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
aware of any experience with the EV
 
04:28:24.830 --> 04:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
buses elsewhere in the world and in fact
 
04:28:26.830 --> 04:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
aren't there thousands of them in
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
Europe I'm sorry isn't there a lot of
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
experience with EV buses in Europe is
 
04:28:34.670 --> 04:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
that something that you've looked at not
 
04:28:37.389 --> 04:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
myself personally again I mean I I I
 
04:28:39.510 --> 04:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
won't claim that EV buses are my
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
expertise um but we would certainly
 
04:28:44.670 --> 04:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
investigate that prior to buying
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
them thank you further further questions
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
please yes thank you for taking my
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
question says that um we have funding
 
04:28:56.189 --> 04:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
from a student transportation fee in J
 
04:28:58.590 --> 04:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
in campus General funds so what
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of your total outlay is
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
covered by those
 
04:29:04.720 --> 04:29:07.389 align:start position:0%
covered by those
charges

04:29:07.389 --> 04:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
charges
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh I mean in a grant like this we would
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
cover 20% through those fees but you're
 
04:29:14.070 --> 04:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the overall budget for the
 
04:29:16.830 --> 04:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
transit system yeah I'm kind of uh
 
04:29:19.309 --> 04:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead represent kind of
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
thinking on you know is it possible that
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
maybe you could charge enough and buy
 
04:29:24.590 --> 04:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
your own
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
buses or how much of
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
the this money comes in is a substantial
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
amount enough to yeah I mean I guess
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
what I can say is that um between
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees we are very restricted
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
um to to the increases that we can um
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
put forward or absorb um and that's why
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're always looking for opportunities
 
04:29:50.950 --> 04:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
like CMAC or other Grant programs where
 
04:29:53.070 --> 04:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
we can get assistance with with
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure thank you for that um
 
04:29:59.070 --> 04:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you representative thank
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman these fullsize buses or
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
Shuttle type these are fullsize buses
 
04:30:07.710 --> 04:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you before we do I I must say when
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
I traveled to Dober and other places the
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
amount of students that uh occupy these
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
buses and perhaps we could change the
 
04:30:19.389 --> 04:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
schedule they end up at my sushi
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant when I'm there and uh trying
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
to get a seat is is very successful so
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
your collaboration with Coast or
 
04:30:28.870 --> 04:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
whatever is is a wonderful thing we
 
04:30:32.830 --> 04:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimon thank you
 
04:30:35.670 --> 04:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
all like to hear from um I believe
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's Randy Byron is that I'm
 
04:30:42.670 --> 04:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
sorry what is it sir Brian Brian please
 
04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
come forward sir two
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you I'm a Randy Bryan
 
04:30:51.070 --> 04:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
resident of Newcastle I happen to be on
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
the energy committee but not the head of
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
it um but I have been uh my wife and I
 
04:31:00.590 --> 04:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
have been residents of Newcastle like so
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
many others for a number of years and my
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
wife's case decades and uh uh it is a
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
community that
 
04:31:15.229 --> 04:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
is I say 80% seniors so it's there's a
 
04:31:19.710 --> 04:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
large uh uh population that are aging in
 
04:31:23.070 --> 04:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
place and safety is a concern and we've
 
04:31:27.149 --> 04:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
had several in the last year I'll say 14
 
04:31:30.670 --> 04:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
months we've had three or four what I'll
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
call 15 or 50y year event 20 or 50 year
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
weather events
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh tide events that have shut off the
 
04:31:41.950 --> 04:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
island or nearly shut off the island
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
from from blocking the causeway and the
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
access through
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
Rye uh from any uh from any off Island
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
activity for you know hours at a time so
 
04:32:00.429 --> 04:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
um it is a I'm just here to re I've
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
submitted uh previous testimony in the
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh in the hearings organ ized by Janet
 
04:32:09.030 --> 04:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
Stevens so I don't didn't want to
 
04:32:11.349 --> 04:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
belabor the same thing now but since
 
04:32:14.710 --> 04:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
then we've had two events where the uh
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
Causeway has either flooded or nearly
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
flooded and you know just last week
 
04:32:21.710 --> 04:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
there was a after actually and I didn't
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
even check yesterday with the
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
astronomical tide yesterday but we've
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
had um Tides either covering the
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
causeway or coming within a couple of
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
inches of the surface and as any any uh
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
Road engineer can tell you that's
 
04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
probably not very good for the road bed
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
so we are uh uh I just want to I just
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
came here to represent a whole bunch of
 
04:32:48.630 --> 04:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
friends who want to express our interest
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
in having the causeway route 1B I'll say
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
which is a long R not just the causeway
 
04:32:58.030 --> 04:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
but but to ensure that uh Coast route
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
access in the in the low-lying areas is
 
04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
addressed uh all the way from South
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth all the way around along on
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
the causeway onto the island and then
 
04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
off Island into uh into the Ry side um
 
04:33:15.910 --> 04:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
where it dips just past the you know
 
04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
between the the bridge and Wentworth
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
Country Club and then it also dips again
 
04:33:24.429 --> 04:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
down around BG's Boat House area uh
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a long path there that
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at very very
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
seriously and very soon because uh you
 
04:33:35.789 --> 04:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
know we've had three or four I'll say 15
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
20 uh 50y Year events weather events or
 
04:33:42.670 --> 04:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
flooding events happen in the last year
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so I see uh uh I've been looking at
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
this for a very long time and and I in
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
in my humble opinion
 
04:33:54.750 --> 04:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotally uh global warming and and
 
04:33:57.269 --> 04:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
sea level rising and weather events
 
04:33:59.310 --> 04:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
appear to be accelerating not just
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
increasing but
 
04:34:03.949 --> 04:34:03.959 align:start position:0%
accelerating and uh I think it really
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
deserves to to remain
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
however whatever scrutiny is applied to
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
the to the 10-year plan post this
 
04:34:14.029 --> 04:34:14.039 align:start position:0%
meeting I believe that this this project
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
needs to has some some big safety issues
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
that go along with it thank you Mr Brian
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the
 
04:34:22.470 --> 04:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
gentlemen yes
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
please thank you and thank you for
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's going to be a
 
04:34:28.189 --> 04:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
short question do you feel you folks in
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
Newcastle been ignored by the
 
04:34:33.709 --> 04:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
do with your
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
concerns I'm not in in a position to say
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
that I can say personally and in
 
04:34:41.789 --> 04:34:41.799 align:start position:0%
conversation anecdotally uh in
 
04:34:44.070 --> 04:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
conversations with friends and others I
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
do not believe that we have been from a
 
04:34:46.320 --> 04:34:47.551 align:start position:0%
do not believe that we have been from a
roadway

04:34:47.551 --> 04:34:47.561 align:start position:0%
roadway
 
04:34:51.789 --> 04:34:51.799 align:start position:0%
perspective um ignored I would say that
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh the concern about the general
 
04:34:58.269 --> 04:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement and concern about sea
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
level rising and an its effect on access
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
to and from the island is a fairly
 
04:35:05.949 --> 04:35:05.959 align:start position:0%
recent origin start start really
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
solidified really about a year ago when
 
04:35:11.230 --> 04:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
we had the first flooding event uh on
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
Route 1B and
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
um uh and and it has suddenly made
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
everybody I mean there are those who
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
were aware and concerned ahead of time
 
04:35:23.551 --> 04:35:23.561 align:start position:0%
but it now made everybody aware on the
 
04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
island it is almost to a person on the
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
island that they have a concern about uh
 
04:35:33.910 --> 04:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
about the uh uh the flooding the effect
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
of flooding on on access to and from the
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
island thank
 
04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:41.600 align:start position:0%

that energy go right ahead just wanted a
 
04:36:23.470 --> 04:36:23.480 align:start position:0%

04:36:29.470 --> 04:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
role here is I'm a regional Mobility
 
04:36:31.510 --> 04:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
manager I'm one of those Mobility
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
managers here in New Hampshire I've been
 
04:36:37.949 --> 04:36:37.959 align:start position:0%
our particular region is all of bnap
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
County uh marac County except for hooks
 
04:36:43.629 --> 04:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
it and three towns in Hillsboro County
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
we have hillsbor daring and Windsor and
 
04:36:51.470 --> 04:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
I wanted to um just to lay out where I'm
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
coming from so uh before coming here
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
today I did speak with Terry page who is
 
04:37:00.670 --> 04:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
the trans the transportation director of
 
04:37:02.670 --> 04:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
conquered Area Transit so she runs the
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
transportation system here in conquered
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
and along with that uh she also runs a a
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
program called Midstate Transit which is
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
a senior and those with disabilities
 
04:37:17.789 --> 04:37:17.799 align:start position:0%
transportation service throughout that
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
entire region and with a volunteer
 
04:37:22.830 --> 04:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
driver program as well so we have Region
 
04:37:26.789 --> 04:37:26.799 align:start position:0%
3 is doing a it has a a lot of programs
 
04:37:26.799 --> 04:37:27.551 align:start position:0%
3 is doing a it has a a lot of programs
for

04:37:27.551 --> 04:37:27.561 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:37:31.470 --> 04:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
transportation um and she has struggled
 
04:37:33.949 --> 04:37:33.959 align:start position:0%
in the past of course with with funding
 
04:37:36.670 --> 04:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
and uh I I I just wanted to hit her up a
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
little bit to see how this funding will
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
impact her going forward and one of the
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
so she mentioned three things in
 
04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
particular she said absolutely it's
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
going to impact her um wages for drivers
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
has has historically been low at that uh
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
agency and she's been able to give her
 
04:37:57.269 --> 04:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
drivers an increase a ra wage increase
 
04:38:00.510 --> 04:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
which has allowed her to actually um get
 
04:38:02.990 --> 04:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
more drivers on she was struggling
 
04:38:06.029 --> 04:38:06.039 align:start position:0%
filling those roles uh the second part
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
was that she was actually able to keep
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
all of the services running which is
 
04:38:12.670 --> 04:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
really great we don't want to lose any
 
04:38:14.830 --> 04:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the services and uh the third piece
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
is she said going forward looking
 
04:38:19.269 --> 04:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
forward if this passes uh she's going
 
04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to continue the service that
 
04:38:25.029 --> 04:38:25.039 align:start position:0%
we have one of the I not sure if those
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
are aware but we have a brand new route
 
04:38:29.189 --> 04:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
that she has just started called the
 
04:38:32.349 --> 04:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
conquered lonia connector we now have a
 
04:38:35.109 --> 04:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
commuter route that runs from conquered
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
to lonia Monday through Friday daily it
 
04:38:41.551 --> 04:38:41.561 align:start position:0%
just kicked off last month and all of
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
the I've been out promoting that service
 
04:38:47.709 --> 04:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
uh all along the Route and we're getting
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
fabulous feedback we're still working on
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
promoting that service getting the word
 
04:38:54.670 --> 04:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
out that it's there and some places
 
04:38:56.029 --> 04:38:56.039 align:start position:0%
we're even having a hard time getting
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
the bus stops in uh but I just this is
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's a huge for New Hampshire to have
 
04:39:04.910 --> 04:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
this route that's in place now and she's
 
04:39:07.029 --> 04:39:07.039 align:start position:0%
going to be able to she with this
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
funding if this does pass uh the funding
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
that's in there she's going to be able
 
04:39:12.590 --> 04:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
to use that as match money for the
 
04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
federal money so she can assure that
 
04:39:17.910 --> 04:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
that route can continue and possibly
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
expand one more little piece is just to
 
04:39:22.029 --> 04:39:22.039 align:start position:0%
give you some background on some of the
 
04:39:23.470 --> 04:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
things that a Mobility manager has been
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish um in the i' it's
 
04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
almost four years five years that I've
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
been at in this role um during covid
 
04:39:33.310 --> 04:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
when the governor had to shut down
 
04:39:36.910 --> 04:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
services and keep that uh stay-at-home
 
04:39:40.030 --> 04:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
order we were able to put into place a
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
shopping for seniors program using
 
04:39:44.350 --> 04:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
volunteers that would do the shopping
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
for our seniors that was something that
 
04:39:49.270 --> 04:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
that we just we had to do on the fly at
 
04:39:52.430 --> 04:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
the and a Mobility manager was able to
 
04:39:54.030 --> 04:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
do that I went back and talked to the
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
transportation director afterwards and
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
she said you kept our buses running you
 
04:39:59.628 --> 04:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
kept these people employed that's what
 
04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
this program really meant along with the
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
fact that these seniors who were no
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
longer able to get their groceries they
 
04:40:09.030 --> 04:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
were able to stay at home as the
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
governor had asked it with with with
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
these um the other thing that uh a
 
04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
Mobility manager has been able to do is
 
04:40:19.788 --> 04:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh we put in for some funding to Rebrand
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
the concrete Area Transit and the
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
Mid-State Transit programs that was a a
 
04:40:28.990 --> 04:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
pro a federal program um and we we
 
04:40:31.230 --> 04:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
applied for the grant and uh this is
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
something it was it was all extra work
 
04:40:35.708 --> 04:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
that a the the
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
transit staff would not be able to
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish it just took too much work
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
but having a Mobility manager in place
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
we were able to to do that to get all
 
04:40:47.628 --> 04:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
that work done to Rebrand their their
 
04:40:51.150 --> 04:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
program and I did bring some brochures
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the uh conquered Area Transit which
 
04:40:54.750 --> 04:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
includes the new conquered lonia
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
connector if anyone would like one I'd
 
04:40:58.830 --> 04:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
love to leave some here for you so that
 
04:41:00.910 --> 04:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
we can continue to promote that and with

that I just uh thank you for your time
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%

shansky um yes representative thank you
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman the the new route the
 
04:41:15.868 --> 04:41:15.878 align:start position:0%
connector from lonia to qu is that
 
04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
primarily for uh employment
 
04:41:21.628 --> 04:41:21.638 align:start position:0%
opportunities and work for and is that
 
04:41:24.670 --> 04:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
is that on the North to South Route
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
people coming in quona to work it's so
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
it it runs both both ways north to south
 
04:41:32.350 --> 04:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
south to it is a commuter route so it is
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
designed for employment opportun unities
 
04:41:38.350 --> 04:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh but anyone can use it it's open to
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
the general public and we're using
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
Mid-State Transit and conquered senior
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
Transit where appropriate as feeders to
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
the stops for those Po Folks that say
 
04:41:49.708 --> 04:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
someone lives in Franklin they want to
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
get to conquer they're not able to do
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
that get to the bus stop in
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
Franklin and and they are eligible for
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
the Mid-State Transit we can use that as
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
a feeder to the bus stop where they can
 
04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
catch the uh the conquered lcone
 
04:42:04.160 --> 04:42:05.590 align:start position:0%
catch the uh the conquered lcone
connector

04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%

Newcastle appreciate this she's uh
 
04:43:36.990 --> 04:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
pretty sick right now with the flu so
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
she wasn't able to come in so I
 
04:43:40.510 --> 04:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to do this
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
also got to throw in I appreciate all
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
the work that uh this this group and do
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
has done uh uh for the Sea Coast in the
 
04:43:50.990 --> 04:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hampton area thank you
 
04:43:55.948 --> 04:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
um now now the note from uh from Kate it
 
04:43:58.030 --> 04:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
is critical that the projects impacting
 
04:44:00.150 --> 04:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
the safety of Newcastle be included in
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan flooding events that
 
04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
used to be rare are now happening on a
 
04:44:08.110 --> 04:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
yearly basis indeed more sometimes even
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
more frequently than once a year both
 
04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
accesses to the island have been closed
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
at least twice the season that will only
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
increase also the seawater flooding the
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
freshwater marshlands at the low point
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
on 1B has caused serious flooding of 1B
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
we realize that the freshwater marshes
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
will eventually become salt marshes and
 
04:44:32.110 --> 04:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
people are working on ways to make that
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
transformation as healthy as possible
 
04:44:38.350 --> 04:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
the critical element here is that time
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
has really run out and these flooding
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
events are becoming the norm this
 
04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
impacts the safety of everyone who lives
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
on the island in a very real world
 
04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
manner please make sure the Newcastle
 
04:44:53.830 --> 04:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
projects are included in a 10-year
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
plan I would be again she she mentioned
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
again that she would be there but she's
 
04:45:00.670 --> 04:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
sick so again chairman thank you very

testify in other uh other committees so
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%

so I'd like to continue on with the
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner you wouldn't mind coming

forward and we will uh take some
 
04:58:21.310 --> 04:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
questions of the committee of the
 
04:58:25.788 --> 04:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner um and um I guess perhaps
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
you could uh give us an overview of uh
 
04:58:31.110 --> 04:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
there were several people with concerns
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
of Newcastle and Ry and so forth for um
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
and I know you had a a private
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
conversation could you just update us
 
04:58:41.470 --> 04:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
where we are with that project sure um
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh once again for the record Bill Cass
 
04:58:46.150 --> 04:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the do um and I'd also
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
just give some some some if if I could
 
04:58:51.910 --> 04:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
to I'd offer I'd also offer some context
 
04:58:54.670 --> 04:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
on the um on on on the discussion and
 
04:58:56.830 --> 04:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
several of the comments on the on the
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
CAC and the EV type of uh application
 
04:59:03.788 --> 04:59:03.798 align:start position:0%
so excuse me so on um
 
04:59:06.788 --> 04:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
on Newcastle uh I was pleased to hear
 
04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
the the the gentleman say that he
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
thought that the department had been uh
 
04:59:14.270 --> 04:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
responsive to this so um there were some
 
04:59:18.990 --> 04:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
2018 19 about concerns with the with the
 
04:59:24.990 --> 04:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
um with the with the causeway we had
 
04:59:27.830 --> 04:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
done a we had done a betterman project
 
04:59:31.390 --> 04:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh a few years before that to um redo
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
the guard rail and uh and restriped the
 
04:59:37.230 --> 04:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
road and um I think we restriped it n to
 
04:59:42.190 --> 04:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
get a to get like a one or TW foot uh um
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
um shoulder on there but as a result of
 
04:59:48.430 --> 04:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
that uh activity and that work there
 
04:59:49.788 --> 04:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
were questions raised about the
 
04:59:52.830 --> 04:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
long-term future of of the uh of the
 
04:59:54.868 --> 04:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
causeway and what what any future plans
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
were we really hadn't had any future
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
plans but um through um you know through
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
through some discussion I get who the
 
05:00:06.510 --> 05:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
State Rep is we did um commit to doing a
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
feasibility study uh we commenced that
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
in around
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
2019 um and uh it got a little way laid
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
through um through through covid but uh
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
we finished it in um 201 2012 and
 
05:00:24.788 --> 05:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
started some discussions with with the
 
05:00:26.548 --> 05:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
town here here were here were the
 
05:00:29.110 --> 05:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
results and there's and that feasibility
 
05:00:31.750 --> 05:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
study was fairly high level fairly
 
05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
conceptual it wasn't a detailed
 
05:00:36.030 --> 05:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
preliminary design but at least kind of
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
you know figuring out a general scope of
 
05:00:41.670 --> 05:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
what what should be um considered and
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
and taking in additional data for sea
 
05:00:46.750 --> 05:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
level rise and things like that so A
 
05:00:49.390 --> 05:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
clarification Please Mr chairman yes
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass you said 2019 and you
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
completed it in 2012 two I'm sorry 2022
 
05:00:58.190 --> 05:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
if I said 2012 I apologize I'm talking
 
05:01:01.150 --> 05:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
too fast but uh it got a little like I
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
said it got a little waye during Co
 
05:01:06.510 --> 05:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
um but we completed it in 2022 started
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
some dialogue with the um with the with
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
the town on that and they had referenced
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
it it
 
05:01:19.030 --> 05:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
was it was uh kind of a
 
05:01:22.510 --> 05:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
um just a a a weird turn of events that
 
05:01:22.520 --> 05:01:23.470 align:start position:0%
um just a a a weird turn of events that
is

05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
that we had we had finished the
 
05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
feasibility study we had a public
 
05:01:29.110 --> 05:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
informational meeting out there with the
 
05:01:31.868 --> 05:01:31.878 align:start position:0%

there was a there was a nor Easter that
 
05:01:41.110 --> 05:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
that that that that did overtop the
 
05:01:44.990 --> 05:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
causeway and it really got um it really
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
got people stirred up that uh you know
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
we had a feasibility study and we're
 
05:01:51.190 --> 05:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
talking about it's not in the 10-year
 
05:01:53.510 --> 05:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
plan it needs to be added to the 10-year
 
05:01:55.230 --> 05:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
plan if anything was going to happen so
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
that it' be you know 10 or more years
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
before anything is is is done um and the
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
urgency with that Norm you know got a
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion with that so through
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
the uh early part of the 10year plan
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
development we did uh recognize that and
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
councilor Stevens had several meetings
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
out there with constituents so we
 
05:02:20.070 --> 05:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
included it um in the 10-year plan in
 
05:02:22.350 --> 05:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
the draft 10-year plan at the end of the
 
05:02:25.948 --> 05:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
10-year plan so that at least um uh
 
05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
there is a project there to uh address
 
05:02:31.070 --> 05:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
the causeway the feasibility study
 
05:02:33.868 --> 05:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
talked about a three-foot rod of uh
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
raising the gr raising the um elevation
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the Causeway by 3 feet um to uh take
 
05:02:44.750 --> 05:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
into account future sea level rise on a
 
05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
on a medium median
 
05:02:50.548 --> 05:02:50.558 align:start position:0%
assumption um so that's that's that's
 
05:02:53.548 --> 05:02:53.558 align:start position:0%
where that's where it stands um so we
 
05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
did the feasibility study uh kind of
 
05:02:58.990 --> 05:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
took immediate action with all that all
 
05:03:00.670 --> 05:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
that feedback and through through the
 
05:03:02.910 --> 05:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
gasa process of including a project the
 
05:03:04.350 --> 05:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
10-year plan it's at the end of the
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
10-year plan um and with some of the
 
05:03:11.310 --> 05:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
other urgency and discussions through
 
05:03:13.150 --> 05:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
the gaset process I think we moved the
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
engineering up by a few years to start
 
05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh to start the
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
engineering um 2025 or something like
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
that 26 yeah so started earlier uh so
 
05:03:29.590 --> 05:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
that we had a detailed design and uh you
 
05:03:31.628 --> 05:03:31.638 align:start position:0%
know additional discretionary grants or
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
things should should we could go after
 
05:03:36.310 --> 05:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
so um I think we did take immediate
 
05:03:39.510 --> 05:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
action uh it it it is it is an issue
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of there are a lot of
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
issues and needs out out there but um
 
05:03:47.070 --> 05:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's moving forward but at the
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
same time uh I know the town and and us
 
05:03:54.310 --> 05:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
are are looking at in consideration of
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants if any additional
 
05:03:59.230 --> 05:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
funding any grant funding can be secured
 
05:04:01.548 --> 05:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
we could possibly get it done sooner and
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
move it up um
 
05:04:07.150 --> 05:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:09.390 --> 05:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question is your feasibility
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
study and other uh
 
05:04:17.470 --> 05:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
information open transparent and does
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
the town of Newcastle have a copy of
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
that yes they do thank you yes it is y y
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
there several public meetings with them
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
um because of the level of interest uh
 
05:04:30.350 --> 05:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
councelor Stevens had asked us to kind
 
05:04:34.910 --> 05:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
of keep the record open so we continued
 
05:04:38.670 --> 05:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
receiving um uh feedback and letters of
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
support uh for for the project
 
05:04:43.470 --> 05:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the throughout the throughout
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
the uh 10e plan development and gaset
 
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
hearing process so yeah it's been very
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
open I think thank you thank you
 
05:04:51.910 --> 05:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
represent Newton um yes please represent
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
balong thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
you again for coming back and take
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions so this isn't a problem just
 
05:05:00.990 --> 05:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
for Newcastle this is a problem for the
 
05:05:04.270 --> 05:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
whole SE Co so what what's do doing in
 
05:05:06.670 --> 05:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
regards to feasibility studies for the
 
05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
whole for the whole stretch because I
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
was in I was in Ry about a month ago and
 
05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh picking my way through the rocks and
 
05:05:16.708 --> 05:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
watching the BMS that were washed away
 
05:05:18.230 --> 05:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
but I don't see anything for ride down
 
05:05:20.030 --> 05:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
here but I'm saying that's Ry and you
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
got North I mean basically you know you
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
got all the towns right right along
 
05:05:25.830 --> 05:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
there so it's not a an isolated problem
 
05:05:28.350 --> 05:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
so uh can you try to get ahead of that
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is that you're that can
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
be done to sort of look at it to plan
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
for uh a a
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
major approach to Transportation along
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
the SE coast
 
05:05:44.910 --> 05:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
and um there are a couple I'll try to be
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
succinct in my answer to that there are
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
there are uh several initiatives kind of
 
05:05:51.310 --> 05:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
going on in in the seast some with the
 
05:05:53.150 --> 05:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
regional Planning Commission looking at
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
hazards and risks uh in conjunction with
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh UNH and the coastal risks and and
 
05:06:00.670 --> 05:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hazard committee that continues to to
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
meet and and bet things so
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we aren't as prominent in that we sit
 
05:06:08.110 --> 05:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
at the table we're we're a member of of
 
05:06:10.510 --> 05:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
that but it uh but that's that's a
 
05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
broader look at the um um not only state
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
roads but but but town roads land use
 
05:06:18.070 --> 05:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
planning uh you know some of the
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
inundation maps and stuff and uh how how
 
05:06:24.510 --> 05:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
to deal deal with with that so that's
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
one aspect on the more immediate aspect
 
05:06:29.070 --> 05:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
and again it's been highlighted by
 
05:06:32.430 --> 05:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
recent storms on the Sea Coast um the
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
the uh seaw wall the revetment wall um
 
05:06:39.510 --> 05:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
along Route 1A particularly from yeah
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hampton Northampton all the way up to
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
like odion's point and Ry um over over
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
over the last several years through a
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
number of nor easers and and and and and
 
05:06:56.150 --> 05:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
storms has um has uh has taken a uh has
 
05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
Tak has been battered and and um every
 
05:07:02.430 --> 05:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
storm weakens it a little bit more and
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
washes away some more of more of the
 
05:07:07.470 --> 05:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
stuff so there was a major storm in
 
05:07:11.670 --> 05:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
2018 um that um had uh a lot of impacts
 
05:07:13.868 --> 05:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
along the Sea Coast in 1A and as a
 
05:07:17.310 --> 05:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
result of that storm working through um
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
working through FEMA and uh you know
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
some of the um uh emergency relief uh
 
05:07:26.750 --> 05:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
things through that we embarked we had
 
05:07:29.788 --> 05:07:29.798 align:start position:0%
started looking at um what it what it
 
05:07:32.110 --> 05:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
would take to restore the revetment wall
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
on the seaw wall along there um that's
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
been in process with various studies for
 
05:07:42.270 --> 05:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
um several years since since since
 
05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
2018 and we have developed a uh pretty
 
05:07:50.590 --> 05:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um um uh preliminary
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
design of what it would take to rebuild
 
05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
that seaw wall that revetment wall to
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
the standards that it was built that
 
05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
originally following the um the um
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
Blizzard of 78 was when it was first
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
built so it's been there for 40 40 plus
 
05:08:12.788 --> 05:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
years taking a beating so um and we have
 
05:08:16.750 --> 05:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
been in the process of pursuing um FEMA
 
05:08:19.230 --> 05:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
funding to to do that there is a project
 
05:08:22.590 --> 05:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan to to address that
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
um it's the uh Northampton Rye 42 312
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
project it's on page 160 for for
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:37.750 --> 05:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah so there are several projects uh
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
with in in in areas with that so and
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's become and and and the biggest
 
05:08:44.670 --> 05:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
challenge is cost it's it's a very
 
05:08:47.590 --> 05:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
expensive project um all told to to do
 
05:08:49.270 --> 05:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and we've got priority
 
05:08:52.230 --> 05:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
areas but the whole area would be um
 
05:08:55.868 --> 05:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
upwards of upwards of $75 million to to
 
05:08:58.830 --> 05:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
rebuild that so we do
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
have we talked earlier about the
 
05:09:04.868 --> 05:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
discretionary Grant we do have a uh
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
Grant application in uh for a um uh for
 
05:09:12.548 --> 05:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
$20 million Grant to help do the first
 
05:09:14.708 --> 05:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
segment the the highest priority segment
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're waiting to hear on that uh again
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
those discretionary grants are very
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
competitive and it's very hard to to to
 
05:09:27.150 --> 05:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
bank on so um I'm rambling a little bit
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
but we do have a plan we have identified
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
what what needs to be done uh securing
 
05:09:35.948 --> 05:09:35.958 align:start position:0%
the funding uh is is a is a real
 
05:09:39.310 --> 05:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
challenge um whether
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
um uh you know whether FEMA funds will
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
will come through we continue to work
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
through uh Homeland Security and and
 
05:09:51.510 --> 05:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
with with FEMA um to secure to to see if
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
there would be funding for that there
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
are Grant applications at some point if
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
none of that comes through we may be
 
05:09:59.430 --> 05:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
looking at using federal funds as part
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the um 10 year plan in future
 
05:10:04.830 --> 05:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
considerations against all the other
 
05:10:04.840 --> 05:10:07.470 align:start position:0%
considerations against all the other
needs

05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:10.470 --> 05:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair and thanks and I
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was rambling I thought
 
05:10:13.070 --> 05:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
you really provided a lot of context it
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
was good felt likeing very informative
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
to me and I I appreciate that so um I
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
just want to say that it does seem like
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
you've got you've got a seat at the
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
table for the big picture working with
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
the planning commissions and with the
 
05:10:28.910 --> 05:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
the coastal I didn't I didn't get that
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
organization so somebody's taking that
 
05:10:33.548 --> 05:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
that big View of like how to address
 
05:10:35.150 --> 05:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
this because it's a whole East Coast
 
05:10:37.868 --> 05:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
problem yes that we're we're addressing
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
um and and I just now see that we've got
 
05:10:42.310 --> 05:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
all these projects are in for for Ryan
 
05:10:44.750 --> 05:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
for Northampton so sounds like you're on
 
05:10:46.830 --> 05:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
the ball so yes appreciate it thanks
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you before and I'll come
 
05:10:51.390 --> 05:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
back to you before we finish up on on
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
this subject um and some members not be
 
05:10:55.948 --> 05:10:55.958 align:start position:0%
aware I
 
05:10:59.150 --> 05:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
remember uh this conversation of rising
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
sea and so forth and uh Hampton and
 
05:11:05.788 --> 05:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
other roads uh you know worries of of
 
05:11:10.270 --> 05:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
being torn out um has anyone gone back
 
05:11:11.548 --> 05:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
and this been going
 
05:11:14.430 --> 05:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
on a lot of years has anyone gone back
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
to look at your initial assessments and
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
seeing if if that is a true course going
 
05:11:24.110 --> 05:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
forward or are you seeing a deviation
 
05:11:26.708 --> 05:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
has anybody looked backwards I'm I'm not
 
05:11:28.548 --> 05:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
sure I follow you but by looking
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
backwards so if I remember right going
 
05:11:34.590 --> 05:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
back 10 plus years there was um there
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
was a need for more money to study
 
05:11:40.270 --> 05:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
whether it was through UNH or whatever
 
05:11:42.548 --> 05:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh rising sea levels and what it was
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
going to do for your department
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
specifically for roads and these these
 
05:11:49.150 --> 05:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
items people are talking about coming
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
across um the uh coastal areas has
 
05:11:55.030 --> 05:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
anyone gone is that an
 
05:11:55.040 --> 05:11:56.990 align:start position:0%
anyone gone is that an
ongoing

05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
05:12:00.030 --> 05:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
investigation and can you tell me if
 
05:12:03.510 --> 05:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
what was thought of 10 years ago is
 
05:12:06.110 --> 05:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
coming true or is it slowly getting
 
05:12:07.948 --> 05:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
there and I don't need an answer today
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
you can respond back another time very
 
05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
quickly it is it is continuing to make
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
progress so when you said 10 years ago I
 
05:12:16.510 --> 05:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
know I I had made reference to the uh
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
Coastal risks and Hazards committee um
 
05:12:21.390 --> 05:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
they had done a very comprehensive
 
05:12:24.750 --> 05:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
report um I think it was around 2018
 
05:12:27.430 --> 05:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
2019 they were charged with that by the
 
05:12:33.070 --> 05:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
legislature um that um we refer to uh as
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
far as you know because there are
 
05:12:36.910 --> 05:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
various scenarios for you know low
 
05:12:39.390 --> 05:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
medium high assumptions in terms of sea
 
05:12:41.548 --> 05:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
level rise and and other things and I
 
05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
think the science is continuing to be
 
05:12:46.628 --> 05:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
refined as it as it goes on so we rely
 
05:12:51.070 --> 05:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
heavily on on on on that work and that
 
05:12:53.310 --> 05:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
work I think continues to be refined the
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
castal risk and Hazard committee
 
05:12:56.590 --> 05:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
continues to meet
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
regularly um reviewing grant grant
 
05:13:03.070 --> 05:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities to um again like I had
 
05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
talked about doing some of the
 
05:13:06.190 --> 05:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
inundation studies and things like that
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
so but I can get you some more
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
information uh uh if if that would help
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
USA Today addition nothing major please
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh further questions to the commissioner
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I apologize
 
05:13:24.708 --> 05:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
rep yeah yes this isn't a question my my
 
05:13:26.788 --> 05:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
assistant I I happen to look on a
 
05:13:30.190 --> 05:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
Newcastle Causeway and he or she put it
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
up I'm here very good I mean it recapped
 
05:13:34.948 --> 05:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
what you said commissioner you mentioned
 
05:13:37.708 --> 05:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
in there it talks a lot a lot about it
 
05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
so it was new castle.org I looked up
 
05:13:42.910 --> 05:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
Causeway and this story came up and
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's even a video at the end so I
 
05:13:47.628 --> 05:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.390 --> 05:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
into okay um and I recognize uh repr
 
05:13:54.510 --> 05:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
Jack uh thank you it looks like the only
 
05:13:56.948 --> 05:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
other thing we got asked about was the
 
05:13:59.470 --> 05:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
CAC project at Durham uh can you talk a
 
05:14:01.470 --> 05:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
little it seems like the CAC money is
 
05:14:02.990 --> 05:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
just plane over
 
05:14:06.350 --> 05:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
subscribed and if we granted Durham's
 
05:14:08.750 --> 05:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
wish and gave them $3.5 million we' have
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
to take it away from something else and
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
so is there a lot of over over
 
05:14:15.750 --> 05:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
subscription on the CMAC what's this
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
what's the situation there so that let
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
me give you some context on that
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
so uh as part of the 10year plan process
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
we usually start the the CAC application
 
05:14:30.190 --> 05:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
round so that we have applications and
 
05:14:35.110 --> 05:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
we have um uh thing things um ranked and
 
05:14:36.948 --> 05:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
scored and have a recommendation to
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
gaset for which projects to include in
 
05:14:44.510 --> 05:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
the Tenya plan so this round which which
 
05:14:47.430 --> 05:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
started it it started probably the
 
05:14:51.070 --> 05:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
winter before so the winter 22 to
 
05:14:54.110 --> 05:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
23 my dates right it's 24 now because we
 
05:14:56.350 --> 05:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
started last spring in Earnest with with
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
the developing the 10-year plan and
 
05:14:59.788 --> 05:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
stuff like like that and that's when we
 
05:15:03.628 --> 05:15:03.638 align:start position:0%
had scored an initi ranked uh you know
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
the the list of applications we got
 
05:15:10.470 --> 05:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
um so there were there were there were
 
05:15:13.670 --> 05:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
two primary uh flavors of projects that
 
05:15:15.470 --> 05:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
that came as part of those applications
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
and we categorized them into um EV and
 
05:15:21.190 --> 05:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
non so the EV charging infrastructure
 
05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
and things like that was a re relatively
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
new eligibility category with with CMAC
 
05:15:30.590 --> 05:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I think close to 50% of the
 
05:15:32.548 --> 05:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
applications we got got maybe somewhat
 
05:15:34.750 --> 05:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat less I think roughly around 40%
 
05:15:37.628 --> 05:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
of the applications we had got were for
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
were for EV charging type of
 
05:15:43.548 --> 05:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the other 60% were for um
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
you know non-ev type of work
 
05:15:51.510 --> 05:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
um transit buses uh sidewalks multi-used
 
05:15:55.868 --> 05:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
path things like that so um the at the
 
05:16:00.190 --> 05:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
same time the uh Federal Highway was
 
05:16:04.708 --> 05:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
developing the um criteria for for EV
 
05:16:07.670 --> 05:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
charging and and and the final criteria
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
and details of what would be
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
required did not come out until May of
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
last year so may of
 
05:16:20.270 --> 05:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
2023 so we we took all of the EV related
 
05:16:22.270 --> 05:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
CMAC projects and kind of put them in
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
the parking lot for the time being to
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
see about the eligibility requirements
 
05:16:28.390 --> 05:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
and and exactly what was going to come
 
05:16:33.310 --> 05:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
out from Federal Highway um so
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
um and I think that was part of the
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
discussion you heard someone from Derry
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
talk today there was their initial
 
05:16:42.390 --> 05:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
application when we got the Federal
 
05:16:44.190 --> 05:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
Highway criteria their initial
 
05:16:46.750 --> 05:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
application did not fit that criteria so
 
05:16:48.910 --> 05:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't have been eligible through
 
05:16:51.230 --> 05:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
some dialogue we went back to them you
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
know they were modifying their
 
05:16:56.430 --> 05:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
application to try to meet the um to
 
05:16:59.590 --> 05:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria um so that that
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
process went on and and in the list
 
05:17:05.470 --> 05:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
there were there were several um there
 
05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
were several EV charging projects that
 
05:17:10.948 --> 05:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
that didn't meet the the federal
 
05:17:13.470 --> 05:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
criteria so so we put them off to the
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
side that they weren't eligible so
 
05:17:17.590 --> 05:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
through the gaset process at the end of
 
05:17:19.590 --> 05:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
the gaset process we had made the
 
05:17:21.548 --> 05:17:21.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation through through GID or
 
05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
gaset had made the recommendation to
 
05:17:27.390 --> 05:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
include all of the all of the all of the
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
eligible CMAC um
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
applications so when I talk about the
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
the EV versus
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
non the in terms of the program being
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
over subscribed we had uh we had enough
 
05:17:44.430 --> 05:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
funding identified for all of the non
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
non EV projects so that was relatively
 
05:17:53.110 --> 05:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
easy um I think we were when when you
 
05:17:55.910 --> 05:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
included all of the EV charging projects
 
05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
we were
 
05:18:00.350 --> 05:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
probably five or6 million do over
 
05:18:03.070 --> 05:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
subscribed out of a out of a budget of
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
roughly $40 million um
 
05:18:09.868 --> 05:18:09.878 align:start position:0%
so the recommendation that gasset made
 
05:18:12.150 --> 05:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
and that we have subscribed to is that
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
even being a little over subscribed we
 
05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
could probably find a way to to to fund
 
05:18:20.190 --> 05:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
all those and and work them in either
 
05:18:22.990 --> 05:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
either through CMAC funds or you or
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
maybe tapping into some additional funds
 
05:18:27.150 --> 05:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh Bill had mentioned some of the other
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
Federal programs that were um that had
 
05:18:32.230 --> 05:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
come out like the carbon Reduction
 
05:18:34.830 --> 05:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
Program that we could possibly tap some
 
05:18:37.310 --> 05:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
of those funds to fully fund those
 
05:18:37.320 --> 05:18:39.070 align:start position:0%
of those funds to fully fund those
so

05:18:39.070 --> 05:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
um so there are eligibility questions
 
05:18:43.110 --> 05:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
that need to be worked through they're
 
05:18:45.990 --> 05:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
fairly stringent um eligibility
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for Federal Highway they
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
want um if you're within a mile of of of
 
05:18:54.230 --> 05:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
a of alternative fuel Corridor you need
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
four DC fast Chargers um uh outside of
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
that that can be a little bit less but
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
those were typically more stringent
 
05:19:05.548 --> 05:19:05.558 align:start position:0%
requirements than some of the
 
05:19:08.070 --> 05:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
communities had in their applications so
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
we were working through that um and I
 
05:19:14.150 --> 05:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
should point out that uh you know so
 
05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's that
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
Dynamic the governor's office also had
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
some concerns about the amount of
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
funding that was going to EV EV charging
 
05:19:25.548 --> 05:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
and some of the changes in that change
 
05:19:27.430 --> 05:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
log that came from the governor's office
 
05:19:29.788 --> 05:19:29.798 align:start position:0%
to the to the to the legisl to the
 
05:19:32.548 --> 05:19:32.558 align:start position:0%
legislature to house public Public Works
 
05:19:35.430 --> 05:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
um there were a few of the uh more
 
05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
costly EV charging projects that the
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
that the governor's office had uh opted
 
05:19:42.548 --> 05:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
not to support because they were they
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
were the more costly and I do think
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
there was a feeling that there was um uh
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of um CMAC funding going to the EV
 
05:19:57.510 --> 05:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
um category of work um so their their
 
05:20:01.230 --> 05:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
their their recommended change was to uh
 
05:20:03.070 --> 05:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
not support a couple of those more
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
expensive um
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
um CMAC projects and redirect that money
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
to um some of the Community
 
05:20:15.150 --> 05:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation and uh rail trail
 
05:20:17.310 --> 05:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
projects and and those are identified in
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
the change log so UNH was here talking
 
05:20:24.510 --> 05:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
about their their project um that was
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
that was one of the higher um higher
 
05:20:31.548 --> 05:20:31.558 align:start position:0%
cost projects and I think when when when
 
05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
you look at the list of projects that
 
05:20:36.310 --> 05:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
one did stick out because it was fairly
 
05:20:39.070 --> 05:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
expensive so and it's a choice I think
 
05:20:43.150 --> 05:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
of of of uh you know how how we how we
 
05:20:44.990 --> 05:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
balance how we balance those funds and
 
05:20:47.390 --> 05:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
balance those Investments
 
05:20:51.270 --> 05:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you and and um before I go to
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
represent pulner so on on the CMAC and
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
and trying to U fund aging Rolling Stock
 
05:21:02.788 --> 05:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
buses and so forth uh what What's the
 
05:21:05.150 --> 05:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
typical makeup what what's powering
 
05:21:07.788 --> 05:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
those buses that are going down the road
 
05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
I would suspect we're not
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
funding many EV buses at this point in
 
05:21:17.430 --> 05:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
time with State matched money would I be
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
correct or
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
incorrect um I I think you'd be correct
 
05:21:23.070 --> 05:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
you have anything to ask there's a
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
single Andre barer is the Deputy
 
05:21:27.670 --> 05:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of you think there's one
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
project yeah right that and sure and
 
05:21:34.350 --> 05:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
then to follow up on that what is what
 
05:21:38.510 --> 05:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
is the favored propulsion is it are we
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
natural gas or not using natural gas and
 
05:21:43.548 --> 05:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
is it diesel there there are several
 
05:21:47.310 --> 05:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
options Mr chairman um the one I
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's a correction uh but a
 
05:21:51.628 --> 05:21:51.638 align:start position:0%
I guess a perception that may have been
 
05:21:54.350 --> 05:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
left with the committee is that CMAC is
 
05:21:56.830 --> 05:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
is the unique funding source for the
 
05:21:59.230 --> 05:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
replacement of Rolling Stock and and we
 
05:22:02.910 --> 05:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
have other programs so 53 39 um they
 
05:22:04.670 --> 05:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
actually um UNH already has an
 
05:22:06.670 --> 05:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
application in uh one of the more
 
05:22:08.270 --> 05:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
traditional programs where we replace
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
Rolling Stock for all of our Transit
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
providers using State badge federal
 
05:22:15.270 --> 05:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
funds so if this is not funded via CMAC
 
05:22:17.110 --> 05:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's not the end of the road for for
 
05:22:19.990 --> 05:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
their buses I wasn't worried about yeah
 
05:22:22.948 --> 05:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
right uh there was a mix there was a mix
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
um uh Coast uh actually we're we've had
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversations with them about
 
05:22:31.628 --> 05:22:31.638 align:start position:0%
future transition to other alternate
 
05:22:35.628 --> 05:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
fuels um uh liquid hydrogen being one
 
05:22:39.470 --> 05:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
but natural gas regular diesel fairly
 
05:22:42.510 --> 05:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
typical um of note uh many Transit
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
providers um outside of our state and
 
05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
some in our state are also looking at uh
 
05:22:51.030 --> 05:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
smaller Transit bus options number one
 
05:22:53.070 --> 05:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
because the availability of those buses
 
05:22:54.750 --> 05:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
supply chain problems we've had since
 
05:22:57.628 --> 05:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
the pandemic but also the The Limited
 
05:23:00.270 --> 05:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
availability of CDL Drivers um frankly
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's a nation wide issue and many
 
05:23:05.788 --> 05:23:05.798 align:start position:0%
Transit providers are opting for non CDL
 
05:23:08.430 --> 05:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
required vehicles um as they replace
 
05:23:10.350 --> 05:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
their larger buses makes
 
05:23:13.670 --> 05:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
sense if I could ask another question
 
05:23:16.670 --> 05:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
the um I was surprised in the work that
 
05:23:19.150 --> 05:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
several of us are on the commission on
 
05:23:22.670 --> 05:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
how to find out alternate funding for um
 
05:23:23.708 --> 05:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
for our
 
05:23:28.030 --> 05:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
roads um that um when we ask for the
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
percentage of um vehicles was being
 
05:23:33.548 --> 05:23:33.558 align:start position:0%
powered by natural gas it looks like
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
there was a curve that went up and that
 
05:23:39.628 --> 05:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
it's leveled out and are you seeing in
 
05:23:42.910 --> 05:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
the transit side of things that that's
 
05:23:45.548 --> 05:23:45.558 align:start position:0%
not attractive and in 10 seconds can you
 
05:23:48.270 --> 05:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
tell me why it's not attractive well I
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chairman I I I wouldn't say it's
 
05:23:51.310 --> 05:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
not attractive I think there are
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
definitely Trends in the industry um
 
05:23:56.430 --> 05:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's a concerted push for
 
05:23:59.430 --> 05:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
electrification that's really led by um
 
05:24:02.150 --> 05:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
California Cali kind of sets the tone
 
05:24:04.030 --> 05:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
for a lot of Manufacturers because
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're the biggest market for these
 
05:24:08.190 --> 05:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
buses um I think in this committee we've
 
05:24:09.990 --> 05:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
identified some of the difficulties and
 
05:24:12.548 --> 05:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
the issues with range especially in the
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
Northeast especially in the Northern
 
05:24:15.868 --> 05:24:15.878 align:start position:0%
Tier of the country uh while
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
California's jumping in Whole Hog with
 
05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
electrification um we have very real
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
range concerns and not to mention the
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
other concerns with safety um that all
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
states are dealing with And discussing
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
so um these are ongoing discussions um
 
05:24:34.190 --> 05:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
with the um ashto Transit committee it's
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
our uh trade Association uh of All State
 
05:24:40.390 --> 05:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh Highway Transportation departments so
 
05:24:42.670 --> 05:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's it's a very real concern I
 
05:24:45.548 --> 05:24:45.558 align:start position:0%
would say it's not trendy at the moment
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's no particular reason why it it's
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
not useful as a as a viable fuel source
 
05:24:53.430 --> 05:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
it is okay thank you represent pulner do
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
you have question just a CAC was a
 
05:25:02.430 --> 05:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
program created 4 you 50 years ago
 
05:25:04.510 --> 05:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
originally to address you know those two
 
05:25:04.520 --> 05:25:05.470 align:start position:0%
originally to address you know those two
things

05:25:05.470 --> 05:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:25:07.868 --> 05:25:07.878 align:start position:0%
congestion and uh air
 
05:25:10.868 --> 05:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
quality is there a requirement to get
 
05:25:12.430 --> 05:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
those funds that you show them these are
 
05:25:14.548 --> 05:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
the most effective cost effective in
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
terms of either reducing congestion or
 
05:25:20.150 --> 05:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
improving air quality or do we use use
 
05:25:21.750 --> 05:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
this kind of as
 
05:25:24.310 --> 05:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
a as another funding source that you
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
know equivalent to all the others that
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying is there a federal
 
05:25:29.190 --> 05:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
standard we have to meet
 
05:25:32.510 --> 05:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
to to use the
 
05:25:35.150 --> 05:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
you know anymore I mean I I I had
 
05:25:36.390 --> 05:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact that there are
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements for for semac
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
funding yes um part of the CAC uh
 
05:25:46.948 --> 05:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
application process is a calculation of
 
05:25:51.230 --> 05:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
um air quality benefits or or um nox or
 
05:25:53.590 --> 05:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions reductions as a
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
result of of the proposed project um
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is part of the um eligibility
 
05:26:03.390 --> 05:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
requirements it's also part of the
 
05:26:07.230 --> 05:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
scoring process when we um when we rank
 
05:26:10.990 --> 05:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh project applications for for funding
 
05:26:15.310 --> 05:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
um so yeah and I to representative
 
05:26:17.910 --> 05:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
Jack's question I think you know past
 
05:26:22.628 --> 05:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
past years there has been um you know
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
more more projects than there was
 
05:26:29.230 --> 05:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
funding so that um that air quality
 
05:26:32.590 --> 05:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
benefit became an even even even more
 
05:26:35.948 --> 05:26:35.958 align:start position:0%
important category um this this this
 
05:26:39.990 --> 05:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
round uh there was again the the the
 
05:26:43.868 --> 05:26:43.878 align:start position:0%
needs pretty closely matched the um
 
05:26:47.628 --> 05:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
funding so it wasn't as um you know you
 
05:26:50.548 --> 05:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
still have to meet the eligibility but
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't as critical a look at the
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
at the benefits if that makes sense yeah
 
05:27:00.788 --> 05:27:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions yes please
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
rep Newman yes excuse me I'm sorry maybe
 
05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
just for my benefit I didn't understand
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
when you said the range considerations
 
05:27:15.708 --> 05:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
on EVS is that range in distance like
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
California is huge your hand yeah that's
 
05:27:21.030 --> 05:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
right um thank you for the question
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
so range per charge so uh typically what
 
05:27:27.590 --> 05:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
you heard during testimony is uh that
 
05:27:29.390 --> 05:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
UNH testified to this and this is the
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
standard practice is you recharge during
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
non- peak hours typically so that's
 
05:27:36.750 --> 05:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
usually overnight with the transit bus
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
um how many miles you get off a typical
 
05:27:43.990 --> 05:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
battery charge is the issue so some uh
 
05:27:47.868 --> 05:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
transit systems uh are relatively
 
05:27:50.310 --> 05:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
geographically contained small you know
 
05:27:51.910 --> 05:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
they'll do a lot of runs in a relatively
 
05:27:54.830 --> 05:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
small area radius Wise from its station
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh some are a little larger um I think
 
05:28:00.030 --> 05:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
the assessment by Rad's team at Coast
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
several other of our Transit providers
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
is battery uh storage especially during
 
05:28:08.470 --> 05:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
winter months because you get less range
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
in Colder Weather um isn't there uh for
 
05:28:13.948 --> 05:28:13.958 align:start position:0%
for most of our transit systems I think
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
UNH is a little unique um that that may
 
05:28:19.590 --> 05:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
be there could be a case for that um
 
05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:21.558 align:start position:0%
there's other pluses for electric buses
 
05:28:25.230 --> 05:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
they typically um have fewer maintenance
 
05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
concerns there's few moving Parts in an
 
05:28:29.990 --> 05:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle but range is the
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
typical issue that we have here in the
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
northeas OR in Colder Weather States
 
05:28:37.070 --> 05:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the explanations
 
05:28:39.670 --> 05:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
further further questions yes um
 
05:28:39.680 --> 05:28:40.708 align:start position:0%
further further questions yes um
represent

05:28:40.708 --> 05:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:28:44.750 --> 05:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
abbit yes um we have a been provided a
 
05:28:47.948 --> 05:28:47.958 align:start position:0%
letter from the Town Administrator and
 
05:28:52.590 --> 05:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
Durham about why their application for
 
05:28:57.150 --> 05:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
um CAC um was rejected because it
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
included um
 
05:29:03.310 --> 05:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
four direct current fast charging
 
05:29:08.070 --> 05:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
stations and what my question is is is
 
05:29:10.390 --> 05:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
this a consideration now that they but
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
it he also says direct current fast
 
05:29:16.510 --> 05:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
charges while appropriate for short term
 
05:29:18.788 --> 05:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
Highway fueling stops are extremely
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
expensive and unnecessary for the sort
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
of destination charging envisioned in
 
05:29:27.030 --> 05:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
our original request is
 
05:29:30.670 --> 05:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'm I'm sure they were aware
 
05:29:33.150 --> 05:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
of this but it was after the fact after
 
05:29:35.548 --> 05:29:35.558 align:start position:0%
they had already put the application
 
05:29:39.310 --> 05:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
in and I mean I guess what I'm asking is
 
05:29:43.390 --> 05:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of notification of these rule
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
changes so as the commissioner said the
 
05:29:48.830 --> 05:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
rules sort of changed or came out after
 
05:29:51.470 --> 05:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
the applications were due and one of the
 
05:29:53.390 --> 05:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
one of the rules and I think we went
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
over it a little
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
bit apology um first rule was that
 
05:30:04.948 --> 05:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
um you had to put in four fast charging
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
stations um if you were within a mile of
 
05:30:12.628 --> 05:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
an alternative root Corridor and Durham
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
Falls half the campus Falls within a
 
05:30:17.350 --> 05:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
mile of Route four which is an
 
05:30:22.030 --> 05:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
alternative fuel site uh Corridor um the
 
05:30:25.030 --> 05:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
other rule is if you're outside that
 
05:30:28.270 --> 05:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
mile you either have to put in four fast
 
05:30:31.030 --> 05:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
Chargers or level two charg Chargers
 
05:30:34.750 --> 05:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
which is slower charger easier less
 
05:30:39.350 --> 05:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
expensive uh to get and the issue became
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
where they were going to put them and
 
05:30:43.430 --> 05:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
they didn't really explain where they
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
were going to put them um so if if we
 
05:30:49.590 --> 05:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
can work with them and they say we we'll
 
05:30:52.110 --> 05:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
put them outside that mile meet the
 
05:30:54.670 --> 05:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that's that's great the
 
05:30:57.548 --> 05:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
other component is they have to be
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible 247
 
05:31:04.030 --> 05:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
and in the application and in their
 
05:31:05.910 --> 05:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up letter they said that they
 
05:31:07.110 --> 05:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
would be used
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
for uh for staff for students and for
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
visitors so so our concern is are they
 
05:31:19.708 --> 05:31:19.718 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible do you need a UNH
 
05:31:22.470 --> 05:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
parking permit to park in that lot um
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know one of the locations was a
 
05:31:27.030 --> 05:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
commuter lot which was UNH students only
 
05:31:30.548 --> 05:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
so they I think we can work through that
 
05:31:33.310 --> 05:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
but the information we had didn't didn't
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
really address the eligibility
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and I think that was our
 
05:31:41.030 --> 05:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
concern and that was a concern with a
 
05:31:43.868 --> 05:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
number of um the ones that were were
 
05:31:45.390 --> 05:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
rejected outright is they didn't meet
 
05:31:45.400 --> 05:31:47.548 align:start position:0%
rejected outright is they didn't meet
that

05:31:47.548 --> 05:31:47.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:50.350 --> 05:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility thank you further questions
 
05:31:53.830 --> 05:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
on CMAC before we move on to other R do
 
05:31:56.350 --> 05:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
you have a question please go right
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair um back to the
 
05:31:59.760 --> 05:32:00.708 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair um back to the
C

05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
C
 
05:32:04.910 --> 05:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
well um you guys plan on rebuilding it
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
do you guys plan on rebuilding it the
 
05:32:10.030 --> 05:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
same height or higher because like last
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
month or the month before Hampton was
 
05:32:17.830 --> 05:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
underwater so that I'd like to know that
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so we we've established uh you know
 
05:32:23.750 --> 05:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and and through some of that
 
05:32:27.750 --> 05:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
coordination with with FEMA as the uh as
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:32:32.910 --> 05:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
existing threshold is's the existing
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
condition to rebuild back to as uh as as
 
05:32:39.150 --> 05:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
the uh as the walls and their invetment
 
05:32:41.548 --> 05:32:41.558 align:start position:0%
that were built uh and we have the plans
 
05:32:44.990 --> 05:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
from um in 1978 following the blizzard
 
05:32:47.868 --> 05:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
of of 78 so that's kind of the threshold
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's the Baseline that that we're that
 
05:32:52.910 --> 05:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're working to um so that that that
 
05:32:54.910 --> 05:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
would kind of generate that
 
05:32:58.470 --> 05:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
would that would set the the basically
 
05:33:01.350 --> 05:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
the height as the existing height we
 
05:33:03.430 --> 05:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
would you know part of the engineering
 
05:33:05.430 --> 05:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
and and some of the
 
05:33:08.628 --> 05:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
um um hydrodynamic modeling and stuff
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
have been looking at a a a um at a
 
05:33:15.670 --> 05:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
better better revetment design that
 
05:33:17.708 --> 05:33:17.718 align:start position:0%
would hopefully be more efficient and
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
and more
 
05:33:22.708 --> 05:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
um uh and and and be able to dissipate
 
05:33:24.590 --> 05:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
the energy better and things things like
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
that so um and I would just so be short
 
05:33:31.070 --> 05:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
answer it's going to be the same height
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
that revetment wall and seaw wall is is
 
05:33:36.628 --> 05:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
really you know intended to dissipate
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
the energy and and and protect the
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
structures and protect the um um the
 
05:33:46.230 --> 05:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
road and the Inland um
 
05:33:49.750 --> 05:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
properties uh it's not necessarily A
 
05:33:51.708 --> 05:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
containment wall like a dyke that would
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
that would hold back hold back a higher
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
level of of water um in those storms and
 
05:34:00.990 --> 05:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
stuff today A lot of times the the the
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
waves and stuff are are crashing over
 
05:34:05.628 --> 05:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
over the seaw wall the problem now is
 
05:34:07.590 --> 05:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
that the the wall has been battered and
 
05:34:11.070 --> 05:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's so porous that um that it's that
 
05:34:12.788 --> 05:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
it's letting a lot more energy and a lot
 
05:34:15.510 --> 05:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
more damage through and I think a lot of
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
the inundation at least that I've heard
 
05:34:20.670 --> 05:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
and observed in Hampton and stuff is not
 
05:34:24.030 --> 05:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
is it's it's as much coming from the
 
05:34:27.390 --> 05:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
marsh and coming from from from from
 
05:34:29.150 --> 05:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
behind and and you probably know better
 
05:34:31.548 --> 05:34:31.558 align:start position:0%
represented that than than than the seaw
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
wall side it's it's back behind uh
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
Hampton Harbor in 236 the Sea Level
 
05:34:39.190 --> 05:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
Rides and the inundation is coming like
 
05:34:41.990 --> 05:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
from from from the back of the strip and
 
05:34:43.948 --> 05:34:43.958 align:start position:0%
stuff I think is what we've observed and
 
05:34:47.350 --> 05:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
I think has been observed So yeah thank
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
you could I please could I go back to a
 
05:34:51.628 --> 05:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
previous question it's about Coastal
 
05:34:53.548 --> 05:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
resilience I please it was actually your
 
05:34:56.070 --> 05:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
question and to sort of augment or
 
05:34:57.788 --> 05:34:57.798 align:start position:0%
supplement some of the things the
 
05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner said what are we doing with
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
about to our infrastructure about the
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
flooding and we talked about um the the
 
05:35:09.390 --> 05:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
legislative group the coastal risk
 
05:35:12.110 --> 05:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
Hazard group so they working with UNH
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
created basically a a bimetric model um
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
if you put in future year and you put in
 
05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
you know estimated flood stage it it
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
shows an inundation model we have we
 
05:35:25.868 --> 05:35:25.878 align:start position:0%
have a committee at the dot climate
 
05:35:28.270 --> 05:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
change committee where we meet uh
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
regularly um to discuss this and talk
 
05:35:34.470 --> 05:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
about you know if if you see this much
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
change uh what what infrastructure is
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
affected and looking at you know how to
 
05:35:46.590 --> 05:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
address how to be proactive in uh
 
05:35:50.070 --> 05:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
developing a plan of if if the numbers
 
05:35:53.708 --> 05:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
do come true you know this bridge is
 
05:35:55.230 --> 05:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
going to be underwater this roadway is
 
05:35:56.910 --> 05:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
going to be underwater what do we do
 
05:35:59.310 --> 05:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
about it how how you know what has to be
 
05:35:59.320 --> 05:36:00.390 align:start position:0%
about it how how you know what has to be
done

05:36:00.390 --> 05:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:36:02.830 --> 05:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
um and as part of that we talked about
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
the numbers being updated um by I think
 
05:36:09.548 --> 05:36:09.558 align:start position:0%
legislation those those numbers the the
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
model has to be updated every five years
 
05:36:13.350 --> 05:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
and I know they're in the process of
 
05:36:17.590 --> 05:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
updating that now um to to to to make
 
05:36:19.830 --> 05:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
sure that their predictions are are
 
05:36:22.190 --> 05:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
match reality so we we are working on
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
that and we we do take it pretty
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
seriously um but um so I just wanted to
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
offer that up thank you could I um
 
05:36:35.670 --> 05:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
represent Mouse I I just had one
 
05:36:37.230 --> 05:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully close to final thing before
 
05:36:39.070 --> 05:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
we're done today and that was just to
 
05:36:41.628 --> 05:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
get do you have time to give us a a
 
05:36:44.190 --> 05:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
little mini overview for the people who
 
05:36:45.750 --> 05:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been on this committee a long
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
time you will be coming forth with a
 
05:36:51.190 --> 05:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
final Amendment for us with little
 
05:36:53.670 --> 05:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
tweaks and things is is that true
 
05:36:57.150 --> 05:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner yes yeah TP typically in in
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
addition to the to the book there is uh
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
kind a narrative or or or or or language
 
05:37:05.548 --> 05:37:05.558 align:start position:0%
written in in in the bill that would
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
detail um any of the any of the any of
 
05:37:11.670 --> 05:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
the changes and and stuff so that there
 
05:37:15.270 --> 05:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
is a um I guess kind of a written record
 
05:37:17.070 --> 05:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
to go along with whatever the changes
 
05:37:19.350 --> 05:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
are in the book so one of the things we
 
05:37:22.910 --> 05:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
had referenced was um uh and we're in
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
the process of doing that the the the
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
fact that you know this 10-year plan is
 
05:37:29.310 --> 05:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
based on a snapshot that we took last
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
summer we need to reconcile it with any
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
changes that have have happened since
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
then we would look at those as kind of
 
05:37:39.470 --> 05:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
administrative changes but um we would
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
want to capture those in such an uh uh
 
05:37:45.510 --> 05:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
in such an an amendment or in the um
 
05:37:51.990 --> 05:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
HB 2024 language yeah yeah so we are we
 
05:37:54.430 --> 05:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
are scheduled to meet again on the
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
21st and we'll be working on the 23rd
 
05:38:00.670 --> 05:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
but we are looking at be executing this
 
05:38:03.548 --> 05:38:03.558 align:start position:0%
bill on the 23rd do you see that's going
 
05:38:05.350 --> 05:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
to be enough time for your department to
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
be able to come up with those changes or
 
05:38:10.350 --> 05:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
are we looking further out I I'd like to
 
05:38:14.190 --> 05:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
work with you so we had an
 
05:38:17.230 --> 05:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
idea yeah we'll we'll try to achieve
 
05:38:19.990 --> 05:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
that okay and if there's any savings
 
05:38:21.548 --> 05:38:21.558 align:start position:0%
that have been found we'd like to hear
 
05:38:23.750 --> 05:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
them before the Senate hears
 
05:38:26.750 --> 05:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
it we might get a project representative
 
05:38:28.110 --> 05:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
Jack yeah just following up on
 
05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Mills there's always
 
05:38:31.150 --> 05:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
there seems to be always some little
 
05:38:33.430 --> 05:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
tweak that has to be made to turnpikes
 
05:38:35.670 --> 05:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
to adjust the numb slightly and that's
 
05:38:37.708 --> 05:38:37.718 align:start position:0%
part of what gets put into the committee
 
05:38:39.468 --> 05:38:39.478 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I hope you won't forget to
 
05:38:42.468 --> 05:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
do that right yeah and hopefully there
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
aren't too too too many tweaks this time
 
05:38:47.948 --> 05:38:47.958 align:start position:0%
I know we had talked about um you know
 
05:38:53.468 --> 05:38:53.478 align:start position:0%
uh the um Assumption of of some some um
 
05:38:55.628 --> 05:38:55.638 align:start position:0%
bonding utilization to keep some
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
projects some turny capital projects on
 
05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
track that
 
05:39:02.548 --> 05:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh that bonding limitation is already in
 
05:39:04.510 --> 05:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
the LI limit is already in the
 
05:39:07.868 --> 05:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
legislation so um we're not seeking
 
05:39:11.868 --> 05:39:11.878 align:start position:0%
additional just uh we haven't we haven't
 
05:39:14.430 --> 05:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
utilized all of that authority to to
 
05:39:17.468 --> 05:39:17.478 align:start position:0%
date so um but we can C so that might
 
05:39:19.150 --> 05:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
something like that may not wouldn't
 
05:39:22.270 --> 05:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't in my mind require a a change
 
05:39:25.070 --> 05:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
in the language but we will make sure we
 
05:39:28.110 --> 05:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at that so and and and again
 
05:39:30.390 --> 05:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
I know the the several things I think on
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
the 21st we'll come prepared to talk
 
05:39:35.430 --> 05:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
about red lless Bridges um about the um
 
05:39:37.910 --> 05:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
Boston express service and and the i93
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
and at the ever Corridor um um it's been
 
05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
late I could probably answer some some
 
05:39:46.830 --> 05:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
questions on um on the capital court or
 
05:39:48.788 --> 05:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
come back at the next meeting to to do
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
that with regard to representative
 
05:39:54.910 --> 05:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
Jack's questions and um any of the other
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
testimony that you heard today that we
 
05:39:59.468 --> 05:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
want to speak to we can um address that
 
05:40:01.510 --> 05:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
as well okay I I appreciate that I have
 
05:40:05.430 --> 05:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
a couple more um so the Sea Coast isn't
 
05:40:08.590 --> 05:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
the only U population that's had issues
 
05:40:11.070 --> 05:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
challenging the storms and so forth
 
05:40:14.468 --> 05:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
North North Country uh Madison Tamworth
 
05:40:14.478 --> 05:40:15.948 align:start position:0%
North North Country uh Madison Tamworth
oy

05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
oy
 
05:40:18.990 --> 05:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
Wakefield um we had two or three
 
05:40:19.000 --> 05:40:20.150 align:start position:0%
Wakefield um we had two or three
tremendous

05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
events um and I was very pleased with
 
05:40:27.468 --> 05:40:27.478 align:start position:0%
the Department's response I was very
 
05:40:29.310 --> 05:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
pleased that the commissioner and others
 
05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
took time uh in my disbelief of how much
 
05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh damage Financial damage we had on
 
05:40:39.230 --> 05:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
our roads uh learning that there were
 
05:40:40.670 --> 05:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
different pots of money that you're
 
05:40:42.868 --> 05:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
working with so I I really appreciate
 
05:40:46.390 --> 05:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
all that help my my question is tell me
 
05:40:46.400 --> 05:40:48.468 align:start position:0%
all that help my my question is tell me
about

05:40:48.468 --> 05:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:40:52.150 --> 05:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
FEMA um I know that a town in particular
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
oapi was lucky enough to have a former
 
05:40:58.948 --> 05:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
employee of yours MH who was who was
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
very very tuned in to software and
 
05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
knowledge and knowing what FEMA
 
05:41:09.510 --> 05:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
wanted so that they had a they were very
 
05:41:11.910 --> 05:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
hard hit they had over a million dollars
 
05:41:14.750 --> 05:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
worth of damage but they were they were
 
05:41:17.468 --> 05:41:17.478 align:start position:0%
able to capture that document and put it
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the form def FEMA by software I
 
05:41:24.310 --> 05:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
believe that that town has already
 
05:41:27.910 --> 05:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
received their funding back to them uh
 
05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
and many of my other towns are not so
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
lucky and I asked uh um ma Senator
 
05:41:38.070 --> 05:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
Hassen to uh if we could get to a point
 
05:41:39.230 --> 05:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
05:41:43.150 --> 05:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
share that software to our towns instead
 
05:41:45.868 --> 05:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
of towns having to purchase it I guess
 
05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
Mike could could you help me understand
 
05:41:51.468 --> 05:41:51.478 align:start position:0%
a little better um and I would hope that
 
05:41:53.590 --> 05:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
the department was quick in receiving
 
05:41:56.628 --> 05:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
funds as quick as FEMA could be that's a
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
good way to put it as quick as FEMA can
 
05:42:00.990 --> 05:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
be because feema FEMA's words were you
 
05:42:02.948 --> 05:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
have this damage you need to take care
 
05:42:05.310 --> 05:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
of your damage and we'll catch up with
 
05:42:07.468 --> 05:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
you in a year and we'll see what what's
 
05:42:09.628 --> 05:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
eligible to be paid for and we'll get
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
that allotment is is there a is there a
 
05:42:16.990 --> 05:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
a femous software package that uh that's
 
05:42:21.030 --> 05:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
being used by the state for this
 
05:42:24.830 --> 05:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
purpose um or are you folks pulling out
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
books and copying
 
05:42:31.030 --> 05:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
pages are you are you if I may yeah
 
05:42:31.040 --> 05:42:32.070 align:start position:0%
pages are you are you if I may yeah
please

05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:42:34.750 --> 05:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
please for the record my name is David
 
05:42:37.948 --> 05:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
rodrig assistant commissioner to to my
 
05:42:40.830 --> 05:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge we don't use a specific
 
05:42:43.948 --> 05:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
software but we do use a specific
 
05:42:48.310 --> 05:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
process to go out and mark the
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
locations and collect the the evidence
 
05:42:55.190 --> 05:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
of the damage before we fix it and then
 
05:42:59.070 --> 05:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
very carefully um take care of the qu
 
05:43:01.990 --> 05:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
quantities of materials and equipment
 
05:43:05.150 --> 05:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
and effort that goes into repairing each
 
05:43:08.548 --> 05:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
specific location so I will check on the
 
05:43:11.110 --> 05:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
software I'm not aware of a of a
 
05:43:14.270 --> 05:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
software it is more the process I will
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
tell you we have six districts we have
 
05:43:20.548 --> 05:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
multiple um people that do this the FEMA
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
rules continuously change every storm it
 
05:43:27.270 --> 05:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
seems there's a different set of rules
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
that that we are work working from and
 
05:43:33.628 --> 05:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
even within the do we have pockets of
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
excellence and this gentleman or
 
05:43:38.910 --> 05:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
gentlewoman from oap was one of those
 
05:43:41.548 --> 05:43:41.558 align:start position:0%
pockets of Excellence we also have
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
districts and places that struggle a
 
05:43:48.270 --> 05:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more ourselves um collecting
 
05:43:50.990 --> 05:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
the the right information and evidence
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
and really comes down to breaking up the
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
locations into small discret locations
 
05:44:01.150 --> 05:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
that that FEA requires us to report by
 
05:44:02.788 --> 05:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank you I I look forward to hearing
 
05:44:06.390 --> 05:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
what you have to say and I don't know if
 
05:44:08.230 --> 05:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
after that Discovery and maybe we'll
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
pick it up when this reaches the Senate
 
05:44:13.430 --> 05:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
but perhaps we should think of some
 
05:44:16.548 --> 05:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
Outreach that the department can do with
 
05:44:19.270 --> 05:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
the towns uh there was some legislation
 
05:44:21.070 --> 05:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
to create a fund and we're going to
 
05:44:24.070 --> 05:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
consider that going forward but it just
 
05:44:26.548 --> 05:44:26.558 align:start position:0%
it just for those that aren't aware and
 
05:44:28.670 --> 05:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
you haven't had this tragedy befall your
 
05:44:28.680 --> 05:44:29.750 align:start position:0%
you haven't had this tragedy befall your
town

05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
town
 
05:44:34.468 --> 05:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
so I have um I have a piece of um road
 
05:44:36.510 --> 05:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
that was washed out the width of that
 
05:44:39.468 --> 05:44:39.478 align:start position:0%
building and FEMA will come out and
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
they'll want to know what it was before
 
05:44:43.830 --> 05:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
before the day it happened and it's a
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable plan that there you want to
 
05:44:48.350 --> 05:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
restore that road that length to the
 
05:44:51.868 --> 05:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
condition it was Prior but you you you
 
05:44:55.270 --> 05:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
need to go so much more Beyond how many
 
05:44:57.750 --> 05:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
yards of gravel you used what type of
 
05:45:00.548 --> 05:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
gravel you used what type of vehicle you
 
05:45:02.628 --> 05:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
used you can't just say a six-wheeler
 
05:45:04.830 --> 05:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
they got to know what the manufacturer
 
05:45:06.430 --> 05:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
of that six-wheeler was they need to
 
05:45:08.830 --> 05:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
know how many drivers were in it they
 
05:45:11.468 --> 05:45:11.478 align:start position:0%
need to know what grade pay your driver
 
05:45:14.070 --> 05:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
was at they need to know where the
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
material went that you took away when it
 
05:45:19.110 --> 05:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
came back how much time if you used a
 
05:45:22.910 --> 05:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
compactor on that what size compactor
 
05:45:25.868 --> 05:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
was it it is an
 
05:45:28.868 --> 05:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
enormously difficult process that many
 
05:45:30.510 --> 05:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
any of the small towns just throw up
 
05:45:33.150 --> 05:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
their hands and their budgets go to heck
 
05:45:36.270 --> 05:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm still pressuring U the
 
05:45:39.430 --> 05:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
senator to see what we could do I would
 
05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
sincerely appreciate I know you have a
 
05:45:43.788 --> 05:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
load of work that's unbelievable but I
 
05:45:45.788 --> 05:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
think if we could do that Outreach
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
somehow and if some funding was needed
 
05:45:49.948 --> 05:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
for that uh if it could be brought
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
forward to us uh food for thought and
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
and and with that representative that I
 
05:45:57.750 --> 05:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
mean getting back to the beginning of
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
the question there we can also do a
 
05:46:02.230 --> 05:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
quick briefing I mean we have several uh
 
05:46:04.590 --> 05:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
emergency repair projects as a result of
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
some of the storm damage you're familiar
 
05:46:09.708 --> 05:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
with the one in um Madison and stuff um
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
so we can give you a quick briefing on
 
05:46:13.030 --> 05:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
those I don't believe I'll have to
 
05:46:15.270 --> 05:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
double check it because they're more
 
05:46:17.670 --> 05:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
immediate and they don't fall in the 25
 
05:46:21.788 --> 05:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
through 34 time frame they probably
 
05:46:25.990 --> 05:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
storm um repair uh permanent repair
 
05:46:29.708 --> 05:46:29.718 align:start position:0%
projects that that may not be reflected
 
05:46:32.230 --> 05:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan anyway so that might
 
05:46:34.430 --> 05:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
be one of the um updates we can provide
 
05:46:36.750 --> 05:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
as well too thank you and I I but I I
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
really want you to think about and find
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
out if there there is
 
05:46:43.510 --> 05:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
that you're the experts many of the
 
05:46:47.750 --> 05:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
towns don't have people in place for
 
05:46:49.948 --> 05:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
that so I think if we could be a little
 
05:46:52.590 --> 05:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
more proactive I think it'd be wonderful
 
05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
other questions to the commiss yes yes I
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
represent yeah I just have a comment I
 
05:47:00.390 --> 05:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
hardly concur the chair's comments about
 
05:47:02.948 --> 05:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
flooding because in my uh Sullivan
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
County area we've had some severe
 
05:47:07.150 --> 05:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
selling in one of my towns Cen and in
 
05:47:09.750 --> 05:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
aworth and I think also in Cheshire
 
05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
county there's been some problem so we
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
really these small communities it over
 
05:47:17.350 --> 05:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
swamps their Road budgets and they've
 
05:47:19.390 --> 05:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
got to repair them and they just can't
 
05:47:22.270 --> 05:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
afford it so these small communities
 
05:47:24.510 --> 05:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
really need help so whatever and I think
 
05:47:26.830 --> 05:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
you have tried to help but they you know
 
05:47:28.510 --> 05:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
whatever we can work with you to get
 
05:47:31.230 --> 05:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
more more funding and to get FEMA to
 
05:47:33.390 --> 05:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
respond more quickly and reimburse these
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
communities that's you know part of the
 
05:47:36.910 --> 05:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
problem that I'm hearing thank you thank
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
you was
 
05:47:41.830 --> 05:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
rep thank you Mr chairman um trying to
 
05:47:43.948 --> 05:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around everything that's
 
05:47:45.990 --> 05:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
been going on here today and this just
 
05:47:49.990 --> 05:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
the way my mind works so bear with me
 
05:47:53.628 --> 05:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
we've all everybody here has projects on
 
05:47:56.070 --> 05:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
this 10-year plan in their
 
05:47:59.708 --> 05:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
Community I'm realizing the extent of
 
05:48:02.230 --> 05:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
what has to happen to make these
 
05:48:02.240 --> 05:48:03.788 align:start position:0%
what has to happen to make these
projects

05:48:03.788 --> 05:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
projects
 
05:48:08.190 --> 05:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
work what do I tell my constituents if
 
05:48:09.628 --> 05:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
they have a concern let's say in
 
05:48:12.510 --> 05:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester the tiets Road intersection
 
05:48:16.390 --> 05:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's on the 10-year plan
 
05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
realistically what is the percentage of
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
projects that are on the 10-year plan
 
05:48:22.990 --> 05:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
that get done in 10 years and that get
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
replaced by other things and never get
 
05:48:27.390 --> 05:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
done cuz I'd like to be able to tell my
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
constituents well well it's on the
 
05:48:31.468 --> 05:48:31.478 align:start position:0%
10-year plan but it doesn't necessarily
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
mean it's going to get done unless this
 
05:48:36.270 --> 05:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
falls into place this falls into place
 
05:48:38.750 --> 05:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's what it seems like I'm hearing
 
05:48:41.310 --> 05:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
today that you have a plan but it
 
05:48:43.948 --> 05:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's going to
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
happen well hopefully we we're we're
 
05:48:49.868 --> 05:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
we're doing a much better job than in
 
05:48:53.030 --> 05:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
than in than in years past I think you
 
05:48:53.040 --> 05:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
than in than in years past I think you
know

05:48:53.910 --> 05:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:48:56.150 --> 05:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
historically um and and some of the
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
members have been here for a long time
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
remember when we had a very over
 
05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
programmed 10-year plan where the
 
05:49:04.390 --> 05:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
10-year plan was estimated to take 35
 
05:49:06.390 --> 05:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
years to complete all the projects in
 
05:49:10.510 --> 05:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
that and um um you know it it set up
 
05:49:12.390 --> 05:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
false expectations like you're like
 
05:49:12.400 --> 05:49:13.350 align:start position:0%
false expectations like you're like
you're

05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:49:16.150 --> 05:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
describing a lot of Mr renberg's
 
05:49:19.310 --> 05:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
discussion this morning with regard to
 
05:49:22.390 --> 05:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
inflation and uh some of the charts and
 
05:49:25.070 --> 05:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
the money in and money out is is all
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
based on I think actions that this
 
05:49:29.948 --> 05:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
committee has had had taken within the
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
last eight eight or 10 years where where
 
05:49:36.990 --> 05:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
where adopted the um and altered or
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
clarified I guess the law to require us
 
05:49:41.230 --> 05:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
to provide a financially constrained
 
05:49:43.830 --> 05:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
10year plan that takes into account
 
05:49:47.548 --> 05:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
inflation and budgets projects based on
 
05:49:50.468 --> 05:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
the year of construction costs
 
05:49:55.110 --> 05:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
so before that uh we we we weren't as
 
05:49:57.070 --> 05:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
diligent in doing that and it led to a
 
05:50:00.030 --> 05:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the um Mis Mis expectations that
 
05:50:01.310 --> 05:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
you reference
 
05:50:04.990 --> 05:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we're doing a a a better
 
05:50:08.030 --> 05:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
job in in doing that our goal would be
 
05:50:10.868 --> 05:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
that if a project gets established in
 
05:50:12.830 --> 05:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan unless the priorities
 
05:50:15.788 --> 05:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
change by the by the region or something
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
that um it will be um it will work
 
05:50:20.070 --> 05:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
through the process and it will be
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
delivered in the time frame that uh that
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
is reflected here I'm not sure I'm not
 
05:50:27.070 --> 05:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Rochester tbit Road
 
05:50:29.948 --> 05:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
Project um there are many things that
 
05:50:32.030 --> 05:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
affect a project delivery whether it be
 
05:50:34.110 --> 05:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
permitting whether it be public support
 
05:50:34.120 --> 05:50:34.990 align:start position:0%
permitting whether it be public support
public

05:50:34.990 --> 05:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:50:38.788 --> 05:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
consensus um things like that but
 
05:50:38.798 --> 05:50:41.070 align:start position:0%
consensus um things like that but
um

05:50:41.070 --> 05:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:43.708 --> 05:50:43.718 align:start position:0%
um I think you tell your constituents
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
that that the particularly with the work
 
05:50:47.150 --> 05:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
that the committee has has done to
 
05:50:49.310 --> 05:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
require us to do a a financially
 
05:50:51.230 --> 05:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
constrained 10year plan that effect that
 
05:50:53.270 --> 05:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
that it takes into account and inflation
 
05:50:57.468 --> 05:50:57.478 align:start position:0%
that that uh this is a um much more
 
05:51:00.868 --> 05:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
dependable doc and if there is a uh
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
Community project that is in the 10e
 
05:51:04.948 --> 05:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
plan that it will be delivered in the in
 
05:51:07.948 --> 05:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
the time um that's indicated
 
05:51:12.110 --> 05:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
here so further questions we will have
 
05:51:14.948 --> 05:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to sit again on the
 
05:51:17.510 --> 05:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
21 uh but we're going to start narrowing
 
05:51:20.350 --> 05:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
down pretty much so that we can uh get
 
05:51:23.670 --> 05:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a position uh to bring out
 
05:51:26.670 --> 05:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
a final a final report on the
 
05:51:29.708 --> 05:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
23rd um so
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
if there's further questions that you
 
05:51:34.150 --> 05:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
need answered from the commissioner or
 
05:51:36.750 --> 05:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
the the staff please forward them
 
05:51:39.708 --> 05:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
through myself we'll make sure that they
 
05:51:45.030 --> 05:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:48.070 --> 05:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
um with that I I do you have anything
 
05:51:50.468 --> 05:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
else you'd like to discuss at this time
 
05:51:52.390 --> 05:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
you find any money while we were sitting
 
05:51:57.190 --> 05:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
here no I I gu I I just uh one more one
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
one more thought to uh representative
 
05:52:01.590 --> 05:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
Newton's question uh for example so we
 
05:52:05.070 --> 05:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
have been relatively fortunate with the
 
05:52:06.628 --> 05:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
with the federal funding and stuff two
 
05:52:09.030 --> 05:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
years ago when the iiga was passed we
 
05:52:13.468 --> 05:52:13.478 align:start position:0%
got uh a a a a pretty good increase in
 
05:52:15.310 --> 05:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
in federal funding which drives a lot of
 
05:52:21.750 --> 05:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
our our program um inflation has has um
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
uh taken up a lot of that so that we're
 
05:52:26.948 --> 05:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
not with that additional funding we we
 
05:52:28.910 --> 05:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
we found that we haven't been able to do
 
05:52:33.070 --> 05:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of new and additional work but but
 
05:52:37.628 --> 05:52:37.638 align:start position:0%
the existing work that's in there um is
 
05:52:40.868 --> 05:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
is is sustainable and and keeping on
 
05:52:42.910 --> 05:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
that's on the federal side we talked
 
05:52:44.948 --> 05:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
about some potential Del delays on the
 
05:52:47.270 --> 05:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike side and that again is
 
05:52:51.070 --> 05:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
directly driven by um by by revenue
 
05:52:54.070 --> 05:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
streams and stuff like that so we have
 
05:52:57.670 --> 05:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know we have costs going up Revenue
 
05:52:57.680 --> 05:52:59.230 align:start position:0%
you know we have costs going up Revenue
staying

05:52:59.230 --> 05:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
staying
 
05:53:03.230 --> 05:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
flat and as a result you know things
 
05:53:05.548 --> 05:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
things move out move things have to move
 
05:53:07.948 --> 05:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
out or or delay
 
05:53:11.070 --> 05:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
um so every two years we update that and
 
05:53:13.350 --> 05:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
provide that that explanation and and
 
05:53:15.190 --> 05:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
and what the choices are to the to the
 
05:53:18.910 --> 05:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
committee and stuff like that but um
 
05:53:20.990 --> 05:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
particularly on the turnpike side that's
 
05:53:22.510 --> 05:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of the nature of things you
 
05:53:24.948 --> 05:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
know we have increasing cost level
 
05:53:24.958 --> 05:53:26.190 align:start position:0%
know we have increasing cost level
Revenue

05:53:26.190 --> 05:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
05:53:29.708 --> 05:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
so you know Pro projects projects end up
 
05:53:31.548 --> 05:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
delaying or
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
sliding so I I you know I don't know if
 
05:53:37.110 --> 05:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's a Miss we try our best to explain
 
05:53:39.868 --> 05:53:39.878 align:start position:0%
those those constraints and stuff but um
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
it it is kind of a fact of life if if if
 
05:53:44.788 --> 05:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
it's important that that those projects
 
05:53:47.310 --> 05:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
or those communities uh you know that
 
05:53:50.830 --> 05:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
those projects be kept on on track um we
 
05:53:52.750 --> 05:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
we need to find a way to compensate for
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
the for the um increasing cost so yes so
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that so the same thing
 
05:54:02.708 --> 05:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
that's happening to all of us is
 
05:54:05.788 --> 05:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
happening to you too yes thank you
 
05:54:08.590 --> 05:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome um one one last item if I
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
could leave you with and perhaps next
 
05:54:13.230 --> 05:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
week you could give me a matrix so we
 
05:54:14.990 --> 05:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
have had in the last couple years and
 
05:54:17.468 --> 05:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
we've had it for years towns will not be
 
05:54:19.270 --> 05:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
or cities will not be happy with the
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process and they'll come in
 
05:54:25.788 --> 05:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
and they will they will want to uh have
 
05:54:28.990 --> 05:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
this committee legislate a change
 
05:54:32.230 --> 05:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
um I think of Conway which was last year
 
05:54:34.670 --> 05:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
which was a lot of work seemed to have
 
05:54:37.150 --> 05:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
the consensus of the department the
 
05:54:39.708 --> 05:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
engineers and the town but a certain
 
05:54:42.310 --> 05:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
amount of citizenry was not in favor of
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
it we just went through just recently
 
05:54:49.468 --> 05:54:49.478 align:start position:0%
Salem 111 uh that intersection could you
 
05:54:52.230 --> 05:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
and and I had a dinner just the other
 
05:54:54.948 --> 05:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
night and I was inundated by the good
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
people of
 
05:54:58.270 --> 05:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
wolfboro uh with the thoughts of two
 
05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
roundabouts at both ends of their town
 
05:55:03.070 --> 05:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
and what a crazy idea that
 
05:55:06.628 --> 05:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
is um could you just give us a quick
 
05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
matrick and I don't need it today that
 
05:55:11.708 --> 05:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
says here's how the process starts as a
 
05:55:14.070 --> 05:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
project it makes its way in it has a
 
05:55:16.910 --> 05:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
planning process and then talk about the
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
public process because you're in town
 
05:55:21.830 --> 05:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're making a presentation I assume
 
05:55:23.708 --> 05:55:23.718 align:start position:0%
with most of these towns you know
 
05:55:26.430 --> 05:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's input from their the
 
05:55:28.150 --> 05:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
from their engineer or their staff
 
05:55:31.708 --> 05:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
there's a Buy in and then you come back
 
05:55:34.468 --> 05:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
again and you present the project and so
 
05:55:36.708 --> 05:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
many times good projects get railed by
 
05:55:38.310 --> 05:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
three or four people that hadn't heard
 
05:55:41.270 --> 05:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
what was going on and that creates a
 
05:55:43.708 --> 05:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
headache for yourselves and it ends up
 
05:55:47.190 --> 05:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
back here so um just a sheet of bullet
 
05:55:50.030 --> 05:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
points of how this goes through and I
 
05:55:52.110 --> 05:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful for my
 
05:55:54.750 --> 05:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
committee members and for myself when
 
05:55:56.750 --> 05:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm having dinner in different towns
 
05:55:59.230 --> 05:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
that I could I could pull that sheet of
 
05:56:01.708 --> 05:56:01.718 align:start position:0%
paper out because you folks really do
 
05:56:04.230 --> 05:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
your due diligence you don't always
 
05:56:06.708 --> 05:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
adhere to your own plan and take input
 
05:56:09.070 --> 05:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be helpful if you
 
05:56:11.190 --> 05:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
could pull that together and I don't
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily need that for next week
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
because you have so much to do but I I
 
05:56:18.150 --> 05:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
think a simple sheet would be would be
 
05:56:20.150 --> 05:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
very helpful okay all right we'll work
