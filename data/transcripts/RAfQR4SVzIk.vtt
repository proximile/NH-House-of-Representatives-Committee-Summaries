00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
Sykes from Lebanon also could not attend
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
today uh new member representative gas
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh oh no um sorry um Hamlin that's right
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
I spoke with him as well he had a long
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
time ago commitment that he had
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
scheduled couldn't make it but says he's
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
watching uh live stream we'll see and
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Coker is also uh couldn't
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
make it today um so I as usual have a
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
checklist of stuff that we can go over
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
for committee orientation specifically
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
um but I'm going to wave that for now
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
because we have all our department heads
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
that we generally deal with um and I
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
figured we could just have them go
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
through their presentations first and at
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
the end then we'll go through some of
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
the stuff that's more more Tech
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
Technical and just committee related uh
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
so without any specific order other than
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
talking to them and checking their
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%

not the uh tolls on the T Pike system um
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
but that that's a significant Revenue
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
collection point for the highway fund
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%

able to take calls without any
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%

00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
facilities we have one here in conquer
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
and another one in Bethlehem to to serve
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
service the the North
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
Country our approach um with the
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislature is really one that that's
 
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
collaborative um we view our role um
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
with your P pending legislation to
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
provide information and data so that you
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
can make the best decision possible um
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
we uh we won't always agree there'll be
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
times when we disagree but uh we're
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
committed to doing so respectfully and
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
and continue to provide data to support
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
any position that that we do take in
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
front of the committee
 
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
before I turn it over to State Police
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
and DMV um I know this is a policy based
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh committee but I think it is important
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
to recognize the highway fund as a as a
 
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:42.039 align:start position:0%
key Revenue source to support both Dot
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
and the department of safety uh if you
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
turn to page three um this is an excerpt
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
from the state constitution that defines
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and its uses um which
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
is both for the um construction and
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
maintenance of public highways um and
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
then also for the supervision of traffic
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
there on there's also mention of the
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
cost of collections in here in simple
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
terms these are the uh these are the
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
costs or Appropriations required to fund
 
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
the DMV on the road toll uh Bureau to
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
collect those revenues so those come off
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
the top before the revenues are
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
deposited into the highway fund for use
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
by um those restricted
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
purposes page four is a summary of the
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
revenue collections at the department of
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
safety related to the highway fund so as
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
you can see the about half of the
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
revenue collected is from road toll and
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
also the new electric vehicle sech
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
charge which is to make up for some of
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
the Lost road toll revenues uh the other
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
half are primarily DMV related fees um
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
that are collected through the Division
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
of Motor
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
Vehicles and then lastly on page
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
five again we mentioned that the dot and
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
the department of safety both um are are
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from the highway fund that's the
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
primarily where the source of revenues
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
to support operations come from um but
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's also benefits to locals so 12%
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
of all highway fund revenues are
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
distributed um to locals for Road um
 
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
repair and maintenance through the dot
 
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.110 align:start position:0%
repair and maintenance through the dot
betterment

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
betterment
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
fund one of the challenges that we have
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
which I think is important just to
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
consider as you're working through the
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
session we've had a structural deficit
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
in the highway fund uh for at least the
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
last three banum which is required a
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
transfer General funds into the highway
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
fund to maintain the levels necessary to
 
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
fund to maintain the levels necessary to
support

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
um the legislative requirements for DOT
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
and safety um obviously there's been
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
some discussions about concerns with
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
General funds this session uh and so
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's un certain if there'll be an
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
ability to do something like that um but
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
that'll be worked out through the budget
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
folks but I just bring that up because
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
even though this is a policy based
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
committee you're going to see fiscal
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
notes attached to legislation um we have
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
a role in developing those estimates and
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to have that
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
context of of what it means when there's
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
a reduction or increase or any change in
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
Highway fund Revenue and the potential
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
impacts those have to safety Dot and
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
then also the
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
locals um with that that really
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
concludes my uh opening remarks today um
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the opportunity and
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if if you're okay I'd like to

turn it over to State Police and start
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
digging into the part that you're really
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
here to hear absolutely thank you very
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%

provide
a

00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
um an overview of the State Police um
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's a very diverse division um so I'm
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
going to give kind of a 30,000 foot
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
Police so when fully staffed the
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
division of State Police is comprised of
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
300 62 sworn state troopers another 40
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
um state law enforcement officers which
 
00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
is your Marine Patrol uh State office
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
complex police force over at the state
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
hospital and another 300 civilian
 
00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:15.669 align:start position:0%
hospital and another 300 civilian
support

00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
staff the structure of the State Police
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
is breaken up uh broken up into three
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
bureaus you have the operations Bureau
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
the investigative service bureau and the
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
so the operations Bureau is comprised of
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
um 83% of our sworn staff the majority
 
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
of our sworn staff is on the operations
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau It Is overseen by The Bureau
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
Commander which is our currently major
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
Brendan Davey there are three failed
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
area captains that oversee the different
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
areas throughout the state and then
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
there's a fourth captain that is the
 
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559 align:start position:0%
quality assurance and compliance uh
 
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
Commander that oversees policy
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
the operations Bureau is broken up into
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh field troops uh as stated previously
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have seven troops uh troop a is on
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast that is straford of
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County um Troop B is
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro and um a portion of Rockingham
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
County uh lower 93 falls under Troop B
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
Troop C is uh the western part of the
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
state Chesire and Sullivan County you
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
have uh marrat County Troop B which is
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
uh which is where our headquarters is
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
also uh located troop e is Carol County
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
belnap County and then Coos and graft to
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
make up troop F which is about 38% of
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
the geographical area of the state so
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
it's very rural um but it takes up a
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
very um large area of this state then
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
you have Troop G uh which is uh over the
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
entire State and I do want to speak uh
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
specifically about Troop G as you'll
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
probably be hearing from uh several of
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
them throughout this session and I
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
brought several of them with me here
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
today just to introduce them um we have
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
Captain Steve sloper who's the failed
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
area commander over over Troop G um
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
staff sergeant Seth Atherton he's the
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
assistant troop
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
Commander um we have the supervisor of
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
the automotive inspect uh equipment
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
inspectors the AIS um Ken
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
chaput so throughout this session you'll
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
probably be hearing um testimony from
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
from them and others from Troop G um as
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
it relates to
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
Transportation so Troop G is broken up
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
into three different sections uh field
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement so field enforcement unit is
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
made up of sworn Troopers and civilian
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
automotive equipment inspectors the AIS
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
were tasked with enforcing the laws and
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
rules governing the operation of the
 
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
1614 dealerships in the 1984 inspection
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
stations throughout the
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
state and 2024 the field enforcement
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
unit completed 350 dealer audits 449
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
inspection station audits conducted over
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
a thousand mechanic certification tests
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
opened 131 new Automotive uh dealers and
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
144 new inspection
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
stations um and then in May of last year
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
2024 a centralized complaint process was
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
implemented making easier for consumers
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
to seek assistance with questions or
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
concerns related to their vehicle
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
inspections a dedicated email and phone
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
number was created specifically for
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
Consumer issues and clearly printed on
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
the vehicle inspection report provided
 
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
to each consumer at the time of their
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
inspection each complaint is collected
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
tracked and disseminated for further
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh Troop G is also um
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
overseas the commercial motor vehicle
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
inspections so it enforces all Federal
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
Motor Carrier safety rules and
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
regulations and State laws and
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
investigates all crashes involving
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
commercial motor
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and then there's the
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
investigations anything fraud related um
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
that is submitted to either the Division
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles or the state is
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
forwarded to The Troop G investigations
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
for investigation so this includes
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
anything from fraudulent documents
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
residency fraud registration fraud
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
odometer fraud um Vin cloning and the
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
theft by deception related to sales and
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
Vehicles the next slide is just um an
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
overview of kind of statistically what
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
we have seen from the division of State
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
Police over the last three years so
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
looking at um data from 2022 through
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
2024 as you'll see um our calls for
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
service have gone up um over 20% over
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
the last two years so in
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
2022 we had uh imately 136,000 calls for
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
service last year over 171,000 calls for
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
service our motor vehicle stops have
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
increased drastically everyone's very
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
well aware of um that we're down as far
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
as Personnel currently have about a 17%
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate as it relates to our sworn
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
personnel we we sit at 61 vacancies as
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
of today um our high a little over a
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
year ago was 80 vacancies so even with
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
the number of vacancies that we have um
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
two years ago with a little over 70,000
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%

just under

20,000 um items of evidence and received

over 12,000 requests for
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of those 12,000 almost 50% 48%
 
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.079 align:start position:0%

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
investigations State Police also um has
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
the executive security and state house
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
security um and the peer unit those fall
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
under the director's office they don't
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
fall under one of our three bureaus but
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
they report directly to uh the
 
00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.710 align:start position:0%
they report directly to uh the
director's

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
director's
 
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
office so that is the division of State
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
Police um kind of in a in a nutshell if
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
you will um I too wanted to thank you
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
for all of your support I know that um
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
we constantly hear that the the roads
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
are out control um I can assure you that
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
we continue to hire um very good
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
competent people as you can see we ask a
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
lot of our people um they're given a lot
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
of additional
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and we refuse to lower
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
our standards you don't deserve that U
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
the public doesn't deserve that so what
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
you see uh representing the division of
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
State Police I assure you um is the best
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
caliber of law enforcement um that we
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
can find so with that said if you know
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
of anybody who would like to join our
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
ranks we are currently hiring uh our
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
next test is March 1st and we'd love to
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
have them so thank you very much uh for
 
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.950 align:start position:0%
have them so thank you very much uh for
your

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
time thank you very
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
much and I know these are presentations
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
but I still thought I'd see a hand go up
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
or two but it's fa quickly again we'll
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
have plenty of opportunities to get
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions answered but I know there's
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
probably a couple that are fresh and so
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
long as they're brief we can move on go
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
ahead 555 bomb squad Services um did you
 
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
guys have any blown in place or or uh or
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
disarms that are not
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
classified not that I'm aware of
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay I just have one the very simple one
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
yes sir um no motorcycles don't do
 
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.470 align:start position:0%
yes sir um no motorcycles don't do
patrols

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
patrols
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
anymore no I didn't realize that since
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
the late 2000s I think we went away it
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
might have been the
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah 2012
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
um there were a couple of of close calls
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh from my understanding is why we kind
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
of went away from Patrol y um it's
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous Ro riding a motorcycle in
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
general uh when you're on patrol and and
 
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
traveling at high speeds trying to you
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
know catch up to offenders um I'm sure
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
that decision was looking at the the
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
pros and cons the risks and trying to
 
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
mitigate those risks and what are we
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to accomplish uh we
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
have a ton of success with the
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
helicopter uh well I'm sorry with the
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
plane our Aviation unit um as you can
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
see from from uh some of the data that
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen yep thanks do you know if
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
other states are doing that as well as
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
far as eliminating the motorcycle
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
Patrol that I'm not sure uh I know main
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
State Police has has done away
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
completely they don't have any um
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
motorcycles um not even for PR events
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
let alone Patrol I'm not sure I know
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does I don't know if
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
they're on patrol or not but they they
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good motorcycle unit thank
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
you if you have never seen the state
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
police motorcycles on an exhibition I
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend you go see uh it's
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
amazing these these guys are incredible
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative London thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh couple questions one is on on Revenue
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
do we or these new toll boosts that we
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
have that are just drive through and
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to be going 65 when I go
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
through I see cars wizzing 80 plus do we
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
do we do we capture the those plates are
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
we able to or do we have a number of
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are absconding without
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
paying the to any anything we can
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
capture there so that's through Easy
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
Pass um it's a completely separate from
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
what the state police um deals with I
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
know that they do capture um obviously
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
the vehicles that are going through um
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
any violators they capture the plate
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
they capture the picture um they do
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
capture speeds but we don't have access
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
to that without um either subpoena or
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
search warrant really that's interesting
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
my other question is and my last one I
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
should say is
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I did have another question if I
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
might Mr go ahead represent
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
follow even if we were fully staffed
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
with the growth that New Hampshire is
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
currently experiencing and particularly
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
on our highways um it's very difficult
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
for the Manpower even fully staffed to
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
fully control the situation on
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
particularly our primary our cherial
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
roads 95 the Fe Everett 93 um we have
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the one plane is there anything that you
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
might recommend that we could help out
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
with as far as tools or technology that
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
would assist uh particularly where we're
 
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.390 align:start position:0%
would assist uh particularly where we're
down

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.150 align:start position:0%
 
manpow

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
manpow
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
um nothing in particular comes to mind I
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
will I will say is since really over the
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
last 10 years um we've become very
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
specialized even more specialized than
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
we were in the past and what we've had
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
to do with many of these positions is
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
steel positions steel positions from
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
Patrol and put them into specialized
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
areas uh because there's a need um and
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
what that has done is it's it's pulled
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
some of our Patrol Troopers um their
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
positions into other areas um we have
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
great need um across the board
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
um we really are the the back stop of
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
so we were able to demonstrate that
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
there is a need for these specialized
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
units but that comes at a cost and that
 
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.349 align:start position:0%
units but that comes at a cost and that
cost

00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
is in some some aspects our our Patrol
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
um license plate readers are down in um
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh investigatively we will
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
use those um when we're trying to track
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
suspects um if there's Amber Alerts or
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
silver alerts s will'll contact other
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
states that have those um license plate
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
readers that are at choke points in
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
certain areas of the highways um which
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
which is very beneficial um to know if
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
that individual is is heading in that
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
that area um obviously we we tap into
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
cell phones and try to track them that
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
way um but the more ways that we're able
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
to track people that are either
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous wanted subjects or missing and
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
endangered subjects um the better so
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
that is that is one thing that this
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
state currently doesn't have that other

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
time in the future to ask all the
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
questions who do we have
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
next a celebrity in transportation is it
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Tim
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
dunlevy and I come to you today
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
representing the Marine Patrol where I
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
retired a couple years ago after 34
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
years in uniform and I'm fortunate
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
enough that uh the department has uh
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
retained me as a program specialist and
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
one of my major duties particularly this
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
time of year is to serve as a
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the Marine
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
Patrol uh first I'll say that I I always
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to come before
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
this committee uh I I think it's fair to
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
say that we've enjoyed a very good
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
working relationship not only with
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
individual members of the committee uh
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
but the committee as a whole and
 
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
achieving uh everyone's uh best form of
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
of of a
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
bill uh I'll be somewhat brief this
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
morning just highlighting uh the overall
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
duties of the Marine Patrol some are
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
very obvious uh some may come as a
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
surprise to you but most importantly uh
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's important to point out
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
our major responsibility is ensuring
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
that every individual that comes to New
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or lives in New Hampshire and
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
enjoys our waterways and our environment
 
00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
our great natural resources can enjoy
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
the specific uh activity that that they
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
wish to engage in and often times those
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
activities are in conflict with the
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
neighbors sense of uh enjoyable
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
activities whether it be a person on a
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
person watercraft a fisherman around a
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
swimmer's dock a power booer a sail
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
booer uh the Mount Washington or perhaps
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
a boat race in wolfboro Bay those are
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
all things that Marine Patrol in some
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
way or another will will touch over the
 
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
Year by Statute we are required to
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
perform and provide three uh important
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
Services first and most obvious is to
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
enforce the criminal and voting laws uh
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
on all the public Waters of the state
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
and the public Waters the great ponds of
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
the state are those that are 10 acres or
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
more in size we'll investigate boat
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
accidents criminal complaints and any
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
freshwater drowning whether it be boat
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
related or not if it occurs on a public
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
water in the State Marine Patrol is
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
responsible by Statute to investigate
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of that
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
drowning often times that that carries
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
over with uh cooperation from uh local
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
and County uh departments and more
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
specifically the fishing game department
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
who oversees the search and rescue uh
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
particularly the dive team uh Marine
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
Patrol and fishing game are often times
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
on the same scene when uh under the
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstance of someone
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
who's missing or drown and a recovery is
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
required the second statutory
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to provide a an
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
education opportunity for the public uh
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh operating power
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
boats uh we are in New Hampshire if you
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
operate a boat over 20 5 horsepower
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
you're required to have taken a course
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
provide proof of a boating education
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
course uh if you're 16 years of age or
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
older we offer those opportunities both
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the classroom and in uh online uh the
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
online option does require an in-person
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
final proed exam uh last year uh we
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
certified a little over 10,000 people uh
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
in their in their operation of of power
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
boats on our Waters
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
the third responsibility is to maintain
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
our aids to navigation on Inland waters
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are boers or have
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
been out on the water uh it's no mystery
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
that uh New Hampshire is uh not called
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
the granite state for nothing uh we have
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
vast stretches of open water that look
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
like they're beautiful uh opportunities
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
to navigate but in the middle will be
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
some of the ugliest Lake Bottom you've
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
ever seen in the form of Boulders and
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
granite ledge and so on and those those
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
areas those hazards need to be marked uh
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
our our unit is responsible for
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining just a little under 3,000 uh
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
aids to navigation in the form of buoys
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
flashing navigation lights danger
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
warning signs and uh Believe It or Not
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh Bridge navigation lights we actually
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
maintain the lights on six Bridges uh
 
00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
purposes we are comprised uh in the
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
uniform side of the the unit with one
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
State Police Lieutenant who is the unit
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
Commander four Marine Patrol sergeants
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
and three full-time year-round Marine
 
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.829 align:start position:0%
and three full-time year-round Marine
Patrol

00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
Patrol
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
officers and this season we had 21
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
seasonal Marine Patrol officers uh not
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
unlike the rest of law enforcement in
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
this state we are struggling to recruit
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh and and to fill our vacancies I can
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
tell you routinely from the the 80s 90s
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
into the early 2000s the seasonal force
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
with Marine Patrol numbered typically
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
between 65 and 85 seasonal officers
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
we're down to
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
21 so I'll Echo what Captain amuchi said
 
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
if you know of anybody that's interested
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that driving a patrol
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
boat on lake winaki is better than a air
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
conditioned Cruise run 93
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
so for what that's
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
worth um always not always that's true
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
last week if you were assigned to the
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast uh the cruiser needed on 93
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
was more
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
appealing our civilian ranks are uh
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
compromised of 11 full-time people and
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
this is where uh it may surprise you uh
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
some of the duties that Marine Patrol is
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for we have three mechanics
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
full-time year round who are not only
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
instrumental in uh manufacturing and
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
maintaining those those buoys and AIDS
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
to navigation that I just mentioned they
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
also maintain 66 different vessels
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
Patrol vessels that range in length from
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
10 feet that being personal watercraft
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
up to 240t Offshore uh Patrol boats for
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
our homeland security patrol in the Sea
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
Coast uh and with that there's 135 uh
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
outboard engines inboard engines and uh
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
a fewer amount of uh trailers for those
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
smaller Lakes uh and ponds in the state
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
our officers trailer uh the patrol boat
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll hit five six seven different
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
bodies of water in a patrol day uh those
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
those boats obviously are mobile and and
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh those trailers need
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance we have four clerks who are
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh processing paperwork
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
related to the moing permit we have
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
Seven Lakes in the state that require a
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
permit if you have a moing uh we have
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
water event permits that are uh
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
compromised of slalom course uh permits

swimline permits uh fishing tournaments
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
firework shows powerboat races uh poker
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
runs and long-distance swims are some of
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
the fundraising events that we permit as
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
well uh we also um have a clerk that's
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
sole responsibility is overseeing our
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
commercial boat program the commercial
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
boat program uh requires a lot of
 
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
logistics particularly in the spring
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
when we inspect over 600 commercial
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
boats between ice out usually in April
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
and by the 4th of July when everybody
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
wants to be up and running by then at
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
the latest what's a commercial boat it's
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
every fishing charter
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
it's every uh kids camp ski booat it's
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington uh it's uh the
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
Marine construction barge that might be
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
working on your Breakwater or or your
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
dock those are all by definition
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
commercial boats required to be
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
inspected on an annual basis uh and The
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
Operators of those vessels need to be
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
licensed uh and we test over 600 people
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
a year on average who are seeking to get
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
their commercial license the majority of
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
them are uh Camp counselors
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh for all our kids camps around the
 
00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
state uh many of whom are international
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
so to get those licenses they need to be
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
in State first so there was a
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
significant push in a two-month window
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh in in late May and June uh to achieve
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
all of those inspections and
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
testings um interestingly when it comes
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
to our mechanics I will say that mercury
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
marine identifies the Marine Patrol as a
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
warranty center so from a budget
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
perspective because we are a warranty
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
center and our mechanics are Factory
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
trained any work on engines that are
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
still under warranty are recognized by
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
the factory and instead of a a warranty
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
rate that a a marina may get uh they
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
exchange uh at a at a prated amount to
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
our parts uh accounts so uh we have we
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
share a great working relationship with
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
industry uh when it comes to our our
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
mechanics the final thing I want to
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
touch on um is our budget resources and
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to point out to
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
you folks um because you hear from your
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
constituents uh as taxpayers uh Marine
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
Patrol's uh budget is uh has two primary
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
sources the first one is the navigation
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
safety fund which is a dedicated
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
revolving fund uh and its revenues are
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
generated from boat
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
registrations uh voting education uh
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
revenues and fees uh as well as as uh
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
moing permits our other water event
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
permits are free to char free of charge
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
to the public the second main source is
 
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
that of the um recreational boating
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
safety Grant uh issued by the United
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
States Coast Guard those funds are died
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
up among the 50 states uh those revenues
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
of which are uh excise tax on the
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of life jackets and
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
fishing equipment that I know fishing
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
game and and other uh outdoor law
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and agencies benefit
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
from around the
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
country um lastly I I'll just mention
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
our homeland security patrol obviously
 
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
since uh 2001 our world changed and we
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
have one uh Marine Patrol full-time
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
sergeant and two full-time Marine Patrol
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
officers assigned to our homeland
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
security patrol on the Sea Coast that is
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
a year- round Patrol involved in not
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
only the escorts of of valuable assets
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
coming and going from the port of
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth but also uh uring security of
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
those vessels when they're offloading
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
product perhaps in Newington uh we also
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
have perimeter security responsibilities
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
for uh Seabrook uh the tank Farms that
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%

generally speaking we do about 400,000
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
inperson transactions at our counters

fact that so many documents are being
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
caught um by DMD employees whether it's
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%

to the attention of law enforcement and
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to follow the laws policies
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to do everything by the
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
numbers but where we can go the extra
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
mile and help customers all of you we're
 
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
going to do it you know I'll give you
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
one example I get a um a text from a
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
state representative yesterday on
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who hadn't received their
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
license in the mail um I suspect that
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
could be a mailing issue because it had
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
been so long um but our new driver
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
license administrator Scott Milligan
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
sent the text to Scott Scott's already
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
last night reached out to the
 
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
constituent um already has a plan to get
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
a license in her hand to include
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
potentially driving out to Milford to
 
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
hand deliver it um you do so much for us
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's a two-way street we've got a
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that are coming through
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
this body um this session that are key
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
to the DMV um they're more than just
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
cleanup uh they should have been uh in
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
place some time ago but they're gonna uh
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
validate the receipt that you get when
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
you renew your license um that receipt
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
that you print out at home we need that
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
in law that's got to be a legal document
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank our representative V
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
for sponsoring that bill and a bill that
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
um when you turn 21 on the weekend um
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
and you renew online you're kind of
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
penalized because it's Saturday or
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
Sunday which means you're going to get
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
that vertical license in the mail and um
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of phone calls we get about
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh over a half a million phone calls a
 
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
year a lot of those phone calls can be
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
broken down into specific categories a
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
lot of times it's process like that
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
where people call and say hey I I
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
renewed online like you told me to um
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
but I got a vertical license showing
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm still a youth operator well now
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
you got to come into the DMV and you got
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
to pay the extra and you got to get the
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
horizontal license um so thanks to uh
 
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
representative V's Bill we're going to
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
be in a position where you can renew on
 
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
a Saturday or Sunday have a grace period
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh you'll get a temporary you'll get
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
your hard copy after you turn 21 and it
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
will be uh in the horizontal format so
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's I get that a lot when I'm out in
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
the boat when I get this position almost
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
three years ago that's a major question
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
people have and um that's a a great
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
change but without all of you and the
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
support we don't make those changes so
 
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh we're scanning all the time we're
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
looking for how we could do the best uh
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
internally um and externally we work
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders I see uh Dan Bennett
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh is here uh Bob Scully was here Joe
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
Scully is son uh we work with nhada NH
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
MTA we work with so many organizations
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to um to make sure
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we're doing the best we can the
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
leadership team I'm going to leave it to
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
them to uh give you an overview of their
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
bureaus and introduce themselves they
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
have incredible backgrounds uh like I
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
said it's an honor to be with them each
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
and every day
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
um projects I'll just touch on briefly
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
um we have one going on right now it's
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
probably uh well it's it's right there
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
at the very top of uh major projects
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
it's a new license and um we're actually
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
phasing in a new vendor uh currently and
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
um we uh you know we're going to be
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
producing um through this new Vendor by
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
the end of the month
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh that's the goal and um so we've got a
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
hybrid in some of our locations of uh
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
the current vendor uh well actually
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
they're both current uh but one vendor
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
and the vendor that's being onboarded as
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
well and uh we're working through so
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
many things on that front it's going
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
well but there's a lot to it and uh so
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
our project manager for that is Ashley
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
Gray she's an administrator she's back
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh holding down the Ford on that um but
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see Ashley here from time to time
 
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
testifying and um she does a wonderful
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
job uh General lir is here with us today
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
as the administrator overseeing the
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
Title Bureau and uh etitle e lean is a
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
project I want to thank assistant
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner Steve Lavoy um you know all
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
the things that we do at the DMV the
 
01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559 align:start position:0%
wins that we put on the board um the
 
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
things that we're able to do there uh we
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
could not do it without commissioner
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
Quinn commissioner Edwards and
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner Lavoy who's really part of
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
the fabric of what we do each and every
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
day to include these projects and
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
another big one that's going on is uh
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking to um with approval to
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
make a move to a new location in Raymond
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
um which would take us out of that
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
co-located facility nepping which is a
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
busy one and it's really tight and it's
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a bit outdated so um we're
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
hoping to uh potentially be in a new
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
location in Rayman off of 101 um maybe
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know in the the spring early
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
summer so um those are some things that
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to um you can see
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
on page 10 our statistics speak for
 
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
themselves uh like I said the uh the
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
call volume uh we have a handful of
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
people that answer calls throughout the
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
division uh they do a great job AC Lavoy
 
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
has worked with our assistant director
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
Jen Bailey who's seated behind me on um
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
upgrading our phone system we hear that
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
from people uh our Municipal agents
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state maybe oh that's on
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall um I was
 
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
going to say is that door open um but uh
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh we get asked a lot about
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
our phone system and um what we're doing
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
now is uh we're upgrading to a modern
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
system and uh I want to thank the
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office and Jen for making
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
that happen for us so that'll help us
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
address the calls better um we talked
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
about the uh the walk-ins uh you can see
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
the online transactions that we have uh
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
over to the uh to the right titles um
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
you know right around 400,000 titles
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
issued um every year that's a huge
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
number uh every single one of those
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
title applications and titles has to be
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh manually inspected um that's a lot
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's a lot to ask of a small group of
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
people um and if you look at the
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
turnaround times on the numbers uh it's
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
fantastic what they're able to pull off
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
each and every day but etitle and Ean is
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
going to help with that as well um a
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
little over 1 million active driver
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
licenses throughout the state uh we
 
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
issue about uh anywhere from 330 to
 
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
360,000 licenses a year uh I want to let
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
you know that's done by um two
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
full-timers and a part-timer uh that do
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
that on site and uh we couldn't ask for
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
better employees than than those three
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
um they take so much pride in their work
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
and they um they're they're good for um
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
producing about anywhere from 1800 to
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
2200 licenses a day and they too have to
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
be manually inspected before they're uh
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
put into the mailer and they go out to
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
our constituents around the state uh 1.4
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
million registrations uh DMV rule sets
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of rules at the DMV we
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
work with jail car a lot and I'm proud
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
to say over the last three years we've
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
made a lot of changes to rules and law
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that we're providing the
 
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
best service that we can um we're going
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
through all of our forms uh within the
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
DMV that's been an ongoing project we
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
actually have a part-time employee that
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
we've hired who is spearheading that and
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
we're making great progress to make sure
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
that we're always in compliance uh with
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
jail car um so how do you deliver that
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
great service you do it with a great
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
culture and I want to recognize all of
 
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
our supervisors throughout the
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
organization um for providing for an
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
incredible retention rate incredible
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
harvesting that knowledge Mak making
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
sure that people know that they're
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
valued and people come to work every day
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
with a with a mindset of we work for you
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
and and we want to do the best we can
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
for you uh but it starts with employee
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security uh I've made that a
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
top priority over my last three years
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
um and uh it's it's paying off for our
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
employees who come to work and feel safe
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
and although you can never prevent
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
everything um you certainly can take
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
measures to prevent a lot and that's
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
what we're doing whether it's a program
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
for uh you know glass at our counters uh
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see on uh slide 15 we have a
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
security monitor program that we started
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh we call them safety monitors now uh
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
eyes and ears greet people when they
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
come through the door lower the
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
temperature I was down in Manchester a
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago uh Larry 30 years
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
military he's one of our security or
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
safety monitors there uh everybody that
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
was leaving that had already gone up to
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
the counter came over to him and said
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Larry hey thanks for the help
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
with the form hey have a great day Larry
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh it creates a different vibe and
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
environment and it lets our employees do
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
the job that they have to do times the
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
400,000 but it sets the tone when people
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
come in to have uh you know an orderly
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
environment for that 400,000 so um we're
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
about to hire our eighth safety monitor
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
um so they're in just about every
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
location around the state uh but we
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
invest in our employees whether it's
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
Columbus State training where we do
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness I want to thank
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
the state police Colonel Mark Hall for
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh two years in a row allowing the state
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
police watt team to come in and train
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
all of our employees on active shooter
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
on the counters where they work to
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
include some simunition rounds that make
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
noise when they go off so that people
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
react and know what to do um to include
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh Justin cting from the New Hampshire
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
fire academy for stop the bleed training
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
for CPR training AED usage Naran
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
training and now we have these devices
 
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
in every location when you deal with
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
400,000 people you're probably going to
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
be put in a position unfortunately where
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
you need to Save a Life uh our employees
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
around the state can do that and proud
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
to see that advancement over the last
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
three years um and the list goes on and
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
on with the um some of the um safety
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
measures uh that we've taken and things
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we're doing um I do want to talk
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
about just to give you some insight into
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
how we think I think um I think that's
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
very important um we're always trying to
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
up our game we're always trying to put
 
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
wins on the board so things that might
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
seem subtle to people uh I think are
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
very important like when you send out
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
over a million pieces of corresponden
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
around the state every year um we want
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
it to read right we want the tone to be
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
right we want it to be grammatically
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
correct uh we want it to have the
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
information that you're going to need in
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
there to be successful so again you
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to be one of the half a
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
million phone calls that we get so
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
little things like when you send out um
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
a renewal notice making sure people know
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
what that entails what they have to do
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
um and until uh hopefully represent pres
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
ative V's bill passes if you're turning
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
21 on a weekend what to expect and uh
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
measures you can take to get the
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
horizontal license
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
um but we've updated a lot of letters
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
that go out and we've uh put a certain
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
Spirit into them that I get emails back
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
from the public that say I learned
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
something from that I could see the
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
difference in the tone we appreciate it
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
they feel like as they should we work
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
for them um licensed production time I
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
want to go back to that when I first
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
came into the position we were producing
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
licenses is uh 35 40 days um in some
 
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
cases we're producing licenses same day
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
or next day and all the credit goes to
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
the two full-time employees Bailey and
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
Alex and Dennis our part-timer who make
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
that happen um how do we up our game
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
commitment it's a noisy room there are
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
no windows they're behind a cage they're
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
producing licenses all day long but they
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
come in and they love it because they
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
know we value them and that's the
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
difference we go from 35 days down to
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
same day the other thing we do is we
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
work with our partners like at the
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
warehouse um well what are we doing
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
we're producing the licenses and then
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to the warehouse and then
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to a third party vendor to
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
look at the zip codes and then they get
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
mailed by US Postal Service why do we
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
need to do the ZIP code thing can we
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
take that out the warehouse uh said
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely let's do that and by the way
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
let's mail these things first class mail
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
so a state senator um the other day had
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
pulled me aside and said John I've got a
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
question for you actually it was a state
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
representative um who had said to me
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
when we were issuing the license plates
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
how was that I came in and got my
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
license on uh the 27th and I've already
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
got it I had it within a short period of
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
time it's the employees that are doing
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
that so um but we're looking at ways to
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
support what they do um CDL expansion
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
how can we make things better for
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
industry well we've got uh you know two
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
they're in the books uh a new Range up
 
01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon uh one in eping and there's
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
going to be a premier facility up in
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem that will open in the near
 
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
future and um we also have a mobile
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh we have a Mobile DMV and
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to get the outfitted uh
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
technology in there which means we can
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
go around the state and we can do
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
license transactions in places like sebr
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
where we don't have a DMV uh or we get
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
o we could have him up here as an
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
honorary guest we sure could yeah big

thank all of you very very much it's a
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
fantastic presentation I do see one
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
question if representative Hill thank
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and in an effort to
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate one of our bills um can you
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
give us a quick update on the blue
 
01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
envelope program yes I can
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative Hill I want to thank you
 
01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
for bringing that to my attention I'd
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
never heard of that program until you
 
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
did um and I've learned more about it I
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
want to thank administrator Ashley gray
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
for putting together a nice memo and
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
doing some research on it finding out
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing around the
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
country um the autism blue envelope
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
program is a great program it's an
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for uh those uh who are
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with autism uh should they
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
encounter a first responder to be able
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
to hand an envelope to that first
 
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
responder on the exterior it has some
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
bullets of what that first responder can
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
do to have a positive interaction and uh
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
deescalate make sure that um you know
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's good communication back
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
and forth you can put documents in there
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
when you hand the envelope over as well
 
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
um so couple things have gone on uh with
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
that I I I don't think we need a bill on
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
it representative and the reason being
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
is in speaking with the commissioner's
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
office as well um it's something that we
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
can do um so I've had the opportunity to
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh to speak with director skippa at New
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standards and training
 
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
he thinks it's an excellent idea uh
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
We've pledged to work together uh to
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
come up with a program to figure out
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
both on the training front um how we can
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
do that for uh for First Responders get
 
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
the information out to them um and and
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
work with the office of Highway Safety I
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
talked to John C the program manager
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
there uh for production um I don't think
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
the envelopes will cost much it's
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
probably quite frankly something we if
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
we can't get the uh Federal funding for
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
we would look at our own budget for um
 
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
because it's just good customer service
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
so um that's a program that we're going
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
to put into motion and uh set up a
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
meeting and start working together on
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
but it's a great initiative I want to
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that forward
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you very much thank
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
again uh next um how about Captain
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
Eastman from fishing
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
game I think I see one other then we'll
 
01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
probably take a short break uh for a
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
minute while I track down uh future
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
presentations good morning Captain how
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
are you good morning chairman was good
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
morning everyone uh my name is Michael
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
lman I am a captain with the enan
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game law enforcement division uh
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
fishing game law enforcement is in
 
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
charge of uh enforcing all hunting
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
fishing trapping other Wildlife uh rules
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
and and laws uh we are also in charge of
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement for uh ohrv and snowmobiles
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh we uh also are
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
charged with uh search and rescue within
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
the woodlands of the state as well as uh
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
dive uh our dive team uh makes
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
recoveries throughout the state and also
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
assists with evidence recovery um my
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
role at fishing game is the ohrv the off
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
Highway Recreation vehicle coordinator
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
um I oversee enforcement safety and uh
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
registrations uh so where you would see
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
me uh in your committee is uh obviously
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
the uh one of the things would be the um
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicles um if you know
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
certainly on the roadway they um you
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
know certainly evolving every day um but
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
in the uh off Highway uh realm uh they
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
seem to be expanding uh
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
exponentially um where a 14-year-old can
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
come up with $3,500 to buy a uh dirt uh
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
electric dirt bike uh he's certainly
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
more fiscally responsible than I was at
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
14 um so uh that's certainly one thing
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
that you may see you know some of the
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
personal um you know electric vehicle uh
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that's coming about and
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
certainly um on the the off Highway uh
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
side of things it's a lot different than
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
than on Highway um right now anything
 
01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
with pedals would really fall into uh
 
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
that has an electric assist uh would
 
01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
fall into into the mountain bike uh
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
realm but uh for all you uh motorcycle
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
enthusiasts anything that has pegs uh
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
really and his operated off Highway
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
would be an
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
ohrv um
 
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
so we also um over see obviously any
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
accidents that occur off Highway um we
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
cover about 60 uh to 65 uh accidents a
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
year um and uh last year unfortunately
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
four of the snowmobile accidents were
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
fatals um and I think that that really
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
comes um you know we have to look at the
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
safety side of things and and how we
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
evolve in that that realm also I I think
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
on the snowmobile side of things
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
accidents are becoming a little
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
different because um certainly we don't
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
have the snow cover that we used to have
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
and and people are falling onto icy uh
 
01:20:12.189 --> 01:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
trails and now we're seeing more
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
substantial uh injuries due to that as
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
well so um really uh you know where you
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
will see me is in in those areas um our
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
officers we have about 42 officers the
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
couple throughout the state um and they
 
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
can cover any one of those things that I
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
described um certainly uh we as like all
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
law enforcement are seeing a deficit in
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
in hiring uh so like uh Captain said
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
they have a 17% uh deficit in hiring we
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
have a 133% deficit in hiring um so you
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
know very similar um it takes a very uh
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
unique individual um who wants to hike
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
up and assist a hiker in a day like
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
today on Lafayette Ridge um and then
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
carry them out or make sure they get
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
into a helicopter and assisted off the
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
mountain um so therefore uh that's thank
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
you for having me today um I have handed
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
out our ohrv uh digest uh to each of you
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
with my card if you have any questions
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
um one thing that is coming up here very
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
shortly is um our uh ohrv registration
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
is going online uh to make it a little
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh easier for our constituents um um and
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
they will be able to go on and do that
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
and and receive registration so that
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
they can operate within our state so um
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
I thank you all for having me today
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Walsh thank you again
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
as always I see a couple hands we're you
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
know what I don't see the Department of
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation here yet so unless
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%

agency on slide I should number the
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
slides but ke asks about dot on slide
 
01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
one two three slide three is um we have
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
about, 1650 employees permanent
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
positions uh right now we are currently
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
running uh about a 25% 24 25% vacancy
 
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
which means that every you know one in
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
every four of permanent positions are
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
are vacant as we as we strive to fill
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
vacancies we maintain uh 2160 State
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
Bridges uh there are about 1,700

just key facts about the department some
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
some some numbers we maintain uh about
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
4600 senine miles of State
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
roadways um we try to pave about 500 C
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
cine miles every year to keep up with
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
the overall maintenance we maintain
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
100,000 signs 96 million feet of
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
striping we try to stripe every road at
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
least once a year um and uh there are 25
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible airports 11 public
 
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
local public transit systems that that
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
we help um administer and administer
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
Federal funding to support
 
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
those on the the next slide um Slide
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
Five I guess uh with a funding summary
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
is a pie chart of our fi 24 actual
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
budget expenditures so the Department of
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation budget was about $700
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
million um we typically divide our
 
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
budget into two parts the um the larger
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
piece is the municipal Aid and
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
construction that's a lot of the federal
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
funds a lot of the other state funds
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
that flow to municipalities that flow uh
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
department uh on the the other half of
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
the budget is what we're kind of
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
involved in now with with the budget
 
01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
process is the Department's operating
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
um we are made up of multiple funding
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
sources as as highlighted there at the
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
bottom uh Highway fund federal funds
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds other funds which is
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
generally agency income and uh we have a
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
very small less than 1% of our budget
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
draw on the highway fund that mainly
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
supports the division of Aeronautics
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit and uh the larger
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
portion there the green half of that pie
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
the municipal Aid and construction
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
budget a lot of that is the federal
 
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
funds A lot of that is the Federal
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation dollars that we
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
administer as part of of our program the
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
operating side of the budget is
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
primarily supported by the state highway
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
fund so that's a very broad breakdown of
 
01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.870 align:start position:0%
fund so that's a very broad breakdown of
our

01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
budget the next slide I'll just step
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
through the various divisions and tell
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
you what they are what they do so our
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
division of Aeronautics Rail and Transit
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
comprised of three bureaus uh overseeing

administer those and there are 13 other
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
open to the public airports that do not
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
receive federal funds and we uh take in
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%

the Department we administer you know
 
01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.350 align:start position:0%
the Department we administer you know
typically

01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:32:26.189 --> 01:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
around uh close cl to $350 million a

year of of um federal funds in our uh
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
Transportation program uh so all of the
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill paying and all of the accounts
 
01:32:37.109 --> 01:32:37.119 align:start position:0%

01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
program and the other um administrative
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
division is policy and AD Administration
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
which uh encompasses all of our human

01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
federal compliance um office and uh um
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
activities that we do for occupational
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
health and safety policy formation as
 
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
well as employee training and with that
 
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate I've mentioned at the
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
beginning we are have put a lot of focus
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
on uh employee training and employee
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
retention and recruitment as we try to
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
rebuild and maintain our Workforce
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
the next division is the project
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
development uh division um that consists
 
01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
of all of the planning engineering
 
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
support right-of-way Acquisitions
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
construction management of our
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
transportation program so those are all
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
the construction projects that you see
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
out there um our my my director of
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
project development likes to talk about
 
01:33:50.189 --> 01:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
it is we are the uh largest uh you know
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
engineering and construction firm in the
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
state administering and developing the
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
state's Transportation program and a big
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
part of that program um becomes the bial
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
update of the uh tenier Transportation
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan that's our governing
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
document that's our legislative
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
authority to work on any of the projects
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
we don't work on any other projects
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
unless they're authorized through the uh
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
10-year Transportation Improvement
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
plan um we the bulk of our uh
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation Pro
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
program comes from the Federal Highway
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
Administration we administer about $225
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
million of um Federal uh Transportation
 
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
funds a year that's mostly going to the
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
um engineering design and the
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
construction of of those projects so for
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
broad perspective in FY
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
24 um we advertised about 84 new
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
construction projects um we provided
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
continuing oversight and construction of
 
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.750 align:start position:0%
continuing oversight and construction of
85

01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
85
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh construction projects with a combined
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
active construction total of about $800
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
$800 million so that was the value of
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
construction that we were overseeing
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
going on at any one time in FY 24 we
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
advertised about $331 million of uh
 
01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:13.109 align:start position:0%
advertised about $331 million of uh
construction

01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
work and that's all comes out of the
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
division of uh project
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
development probably the division you're
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
most familiar with or
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
or or see along the roads and highways
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh the orange trucks the folks plowing
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
the roads the folks maintaining the
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
roads that's under the maintenance and
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
Operations Division um so we have a
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated Statewide Workforce when I
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned this
 
01:35:45.629 --> 01:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
1651 uh permanent positions we are uh
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
located all over the state we have about
 
01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
84 different uh Patrol uh sections and
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
Facilities to maintain the state highway
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
system across the state we uh under
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance that's divided into
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
six Regional maintenance districts that
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
provide the um administrative oversight
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
of those maintenance
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
activities um and uh you know the big
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
part of our focus is uh particularly
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
this time of year is the winter
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance operations keeping the roads
 
01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
plowed and cleared and responding to
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
storms um another big part in the past
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
several years has been the uh response
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
to emergency events there has not been a
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
summer and and even a winter when we
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
haven't had some some flood some natural
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
disaster uh roadway wash outs and it's
 
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh this dedicated Statewide Workforce
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
that are the front lines and responding
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
to those uh getting the roads put back
 
01:36:45.149 --> 01:36:45.159 align:start position:0%
together getting traffic moving
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
again um so Highway Maintenance is is uh
 
01:36:50.669 --> 01:36:50.679 align:start position:0%
and those are the guys in the orange
 
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
trucks that you see around the they're
 
01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.550 align:start position:0%
trucks that you see around the they're
um

01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:57.159 align:start position:0%
they're the uh Forefront of the Highway
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
Maintenance activities but uh overall
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
operations activities are also supported
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
by the Bureau of traffic that do all of
 
01:37:06.669 --> 01:37:06.679 align:start position:0%
the line striping uh set the speed
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
limits do the signs maintain the signals
 
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
we have a uh Bureau of bridge
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance that maintains that does the
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
routine maintenance of of uh State
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
Bridges um divided into 12 Bridge
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
construction Crews we have a Mechanical
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau that maintains me the
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
state uh vehicle Fleet and have uh the
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
main garage here in conquer but also six
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
satellite facilities that support each
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the uh districts and the um Fleet
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
equipment in each of those facilities in
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
each of those districts um many people
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
don't know as well that the Department
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
of Transportation maintains the state's
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
fuel distribution system um so we have
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
87 fuel sites maintains um you know
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
fueling our vehicles but also all of the
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities can can um um refuel at
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
our sites State Police uh everybody and
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
we are the um strategic fuel reserve for
 
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
the state as well and uh lastly uh we
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
have a transportation systems management
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
and operation center it's located
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
collocated with the Department of Safety
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
um police State Police dispatch uh and a
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
traff traffic Management Center Traffic
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
Management Center uh and that maintains
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
the um the eyes and ears on the on the
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
highway system looking out and managing
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
all the uh um cameras and sensors and
 
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
everything that we managed to keep an
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
keep eyes on the on on the
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
road so that's a general brief overview
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
of the department I have a few just
 
01:38:52.030 --> 01:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
other um elements of the department that
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out the next
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
slide I just talk a little bit about the
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
highway fund and I I believe you heard
 
01:38:59.950 --> 01:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
from Steve Lavoy a little bit more about
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
the highway fund as well too but um
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
there is kind of a misnomer that we'd
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
like to point out uh the highway fund
 
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
comes from the uh state road toll that's
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
the gas tax as well as the um um
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
registration fees and uh but even though
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
it has Highway in its name uh the
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
highway fund is not the deal and the dot
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
is not the highway fund uh Department of
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
Safety collects all the revenues for the
 
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
for the for the highway fund um and it's
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted reeven Revenue fund
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
that comes from those resources but it's
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
the legislator legislature that that um
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
appropriates the funds um and we are not
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
the only um drawer of Highway funds in
 
01:39:48.109 --> 01:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
fact if you look at the stats at the
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
bottom in
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
2024 while it is our primary source of
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh revenue for um for our operating
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
budget um in
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
2024 only about 57% of the highway fund
 
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:07.639 align:start position:0%
was appropriated to do that means 40% or
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
or more you know went to other agencies
 
01:40:14.109 --> 01:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
um as well as to local
 
01:40:14.119 --> 01:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
um as well as to local
municipalities

01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:40:20.189 --> 01:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
um but we do um like I said that is the
 
01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
highway fund is is the primary source of
 
01:40:24.189 --> 01:40:24.199 align:start position:0%
funding for our Rock operations budget
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
and to keep us
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
running the uh the next slide just gives
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
a quick overview of the turnpike system
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh which is an enterprise system so
 
01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.709 align:start position:0%
uh which is an enterprise system so
there

01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
areund uh about 89 miles uh of of
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
Interstate freeway facilities that are
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
told uh that comprise the uh Turnpike
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
system so it's an Enterprise System
 
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
meaning that the revenue that's
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
collected from those toll plazas like in
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
hookit like in Bedford
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
like in uh like in Hampton that that
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue that comes from those tolls uh
 
01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
stays within the turnpike system and
 
01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
goes to just maintain those 89 miles of
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
of uh roadway so we can't take and you
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
utilize uh Turnpike funds on other areas
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh or other roadways in the state so
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's a self-contained self-managed
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
system self-funded by the by the tolls
 
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
on those
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
facilities um so there just some facts
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
some figures about the turnpike system
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
there but in FY 24 for order of
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
magnitude uh they collected about $149
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
million of total revenue um uh out of
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
1188 million tot transactions along the
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
turnpike system so in the in the graphic
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
there just uh highlights you know the
 
01:41:44.599 --> 01:41:45.830 align:start position:0%
there just uh highlights you know the
the

01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
um the toll system probably in this area
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
the the primary route North South 93
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
between Exit 14 and and conquered down
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
to the 293 split is part of the Fe ever
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
turnike that's part of the toll system
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining F ever Turnpike
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
goes down 293 and down the F ever
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
Turnpike uh to the state line uh in
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
between nashaa and
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and on the Sea Coast I95
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh from from C Brook to Portsmouth is a
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
to facility as part of the turnpike
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
system as well as the Spalding Turnpike
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
from Portsmouth up to
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
um up to
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
Milton so very briefly the next slide it
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
just discussed some of the issues and
 
01:42:35.229 --> 01:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
challenges that the department is facing
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
inflation uh certainly no secret but uh
 
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
inflation is uh certainly one of the key
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
issues we're dealing with everything is
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
costing more and we have essentially
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
level and flat budgets um it's affecting
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
construction work we've seen uh in the
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
last year and a half substantial
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
escalation and construction costs um we
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
are keeping up uh the additional Federal
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
funding that we got with a federal um
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
transportation bill um represented about
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh 25 to 28% increase in federal funds
 
01:43:15.629 --> 01:43:15.639 align:start position:0%
um uh a lot of that has been absorbed by
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
inflation so we have a very sustainable
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
program but we aren't doing a whole lot
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
more because of inflation and that's
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
affecting also operation ations
 
01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
everything is um everything is costing
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
more the salt that we use the equipment
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
that we buy and and things like that um
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
I already talked a little bit about the
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
workforce vacancies again we're running
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
about a 24% vacancy rate we have never
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
really recovered from covid so for the
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
last two to three years we have been uh
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
dealing and managing with things with
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
with that um vacancy rate it fluctuates
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
a little Up Up and Down but it seems to
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
have uh kind of been level at around
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
that rate uh and we have difficulty
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining employees
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
despite uh a very concerted effort on
 
01:44:05.589 --> 01:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
our part to rebuild the
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
workforce um and some of the
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
implications of that are uh in
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
productivity so we have performance
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
targets we have a lot of uh work
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
programs and and things that we would um
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
achieve that we would like to achieve uh
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
and uh we are falling short on our
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
targets we are constantly prioritizing
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
resources to address the critical needs
 
01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
um and and one of the things I I like to
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
say that I the way I summarize it in our
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
budget pres presentation is that we are
 
01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
getting done what we have to get done
 
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
but we aren't getting done everything
 
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
that that we should be because of the
 
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
because of our vacancy rates and part of
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
the impact is going to be some some some
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
future impacts it's it's reducing
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance so uh we aren't
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
getting out there and Main maintaining
 
01:44:56.109 --> 01:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
um the Mowing and the ditching and
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
everything like that that that we should
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
be as we prioritize resources to other
 
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
critical Life Safety
 
01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.950 align:start position:0%
critical Life Safety
areas

01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
um when you look at issues and
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
challenges the next slide is a is a
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
graph comparing our historic uh
 
01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce Staffing to um vehicle miles
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
traveled which is a measure of the use
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
of our transportation system so you you
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
can see that going back uh 20 years or
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
so we were resourced we were staffed a a
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
at a higher um at a higher level um we
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
have continued to reduce
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh We've contined to try to do
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
more with less um and at the same time
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
the use of our system uh the vehicle
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
mile travels have been uh increasing so
 
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
I like to call this graphic our
 
01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
efficientcy graphic because I do think
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
it indicates that the Department of
 
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation is is efficient we
 
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
continue to do uh more more with less um
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
we have not added positions in the last
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
10 10 years and we've been relatively
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
flat and stable and we found ways to do
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
things um whether it be with hired help
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
or consultant help or other other ways
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
um to maintain a stable and level
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce longer term challenges um you
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
know do become you know fund funding
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
issues there is insufficient Highway
 
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
fund revenues to fund current levels of
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
service um we do not match our federal
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
funds like other states do with uh we
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
put very little State funds into
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
matching our federal program um as as a
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
result our federal funds do not go as
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
far um but that's a decision that that
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we have made with with limited
 
01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:53.950 align:start position:0%
that we have made with with limited
state

01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
but there are very very little State
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
funds that go into our um transportation
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
program and uh you know it is uh as you
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
look ahead and and forecasting we do see
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
you know declining roll toe revenues as
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
um fuel efficiency increases in vehicles
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles come online um so the
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the highway fund you
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
know continues to be a a question in in
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
in the long term
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
in the long term and over the past you
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
know 10 or 15 years every biennium the
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
highway fund has uh you know been
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
balanced our B our budgets have been
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
balanced through a series of one-time
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
fixes whether it's general fund infusion
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund or or other um
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
registration fees or charges or other
 
01:47:49.589 --> 01:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
things that have been done uh on these
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
one-time budget fixes so um in the long
 
01:47:56.830 --> 01:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
run I guess it's it's just that that
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
questionable sustainability of overall
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
minds so
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
um the next slide these are the types of
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
of things at the trans Transportation
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
committee that you all typically uh
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
interact with the Department on the
 
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
types of bills usually it's bills
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with speed limits or line
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
striping or seasonal postings pedestrian
 
01:48:25.709 --> 01:48:25.719 align:start position:0%
traffic signals um
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
ohvs um drones or other aeronautic uses
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
those are some of the types of bills in
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
the past that uh we have come before
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
this uh committee to answer questions
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
and bills
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
on and um
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I haven't looked ahead
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
at what the bills are before the
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee but I'm sure we'll be back
 
01:48:49.229 --> 01:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
before you for some questions at some
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
point um the last two point I wanted to
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
make um little
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
less pertinent to the transportation
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee than it is to say house public
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
works but every two years we update the
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
10-year plan so uh that is coming up
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
beginning this this uh this summer we'll
 
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
start public hearings with the um
 
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
executive councel um make a uh
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the governor by next
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
December um and ultimately next section
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
the uh revised or updated 10-year plan
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
will become a piece of legislation
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
coming before the legislature um but
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
that work begins um this summer to uh um
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
form and develop the the plan and and
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
part of that plan will be as I said with
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
some of the um flat or level Financial
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
Resources what choices uh we need to
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
make as a as a state of where we want to
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
invest uh those funding what projects
 
01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do but um I can tell you
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
and and you probably all know from your
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
constituents there are many more needs
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
than there are resources so those
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
choices become um uh you know very
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
pertinent and lastly I just want to put
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
in a plug for the uh New Hampshire um
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
transportation Council chairman Walsh
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
sits on the transportation Council so
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
he's well aware of it but uh there is a
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
transportation Council that was
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
established by legislature to partner
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
with the do it's made up of a number of
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
other um
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
um state agencies as well as uh
 
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:31.639 align:start position:0%
representatives from the from the House
 
01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
and Senate and and and and the public um
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
and they're charged with studying or
 
01:50:37.159 --> 01:50:38.470 align:start position:0%
and they're charged with studying or
investigating

01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
evaluating um new Transportation
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
Technologies and and modes to improve
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
improve Transportation so I know a
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
number of times particularly in this
 
01:50:51.069 --> 01:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
committee things have come before the
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee that may warrant more
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation more more study uh and I
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
think the transportation Council can be
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
a resource to the legislature or
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
resource to the uh to this Committee in
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
in researching or evaluating any you
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
know newer Technologies or or things
 
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
that come along that that could affect
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
um that could affect your work so I just
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
want to make you aware of that so you're
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
aware um and that's all I had from an
 
01:51:24.589 --> 01:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
overview of the uh Department of
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
Transportation and certainly willing to
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
entertain whatever questions the
 
01:51:28.159 --> 01:51:29.470 align:start position:0%
entertain whatever questions the
committee

01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
has thank you so much any questions from
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
Peto thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh for coming taking my question um
 
01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
concerning the highway fund uh talked
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
about uh declining revenues in one of
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
the previous presentations this morning
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
there was an illusion to an electrical
 
01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle charge um could you describe
 
01:51:58.109 --> 01:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
what that is yeah I think the I I'm
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
speaking a little bit off the cuff but I
 
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
know um and Dave if you you or you know
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
I know um I'll have Dave come up but uh
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
if it was last year the legisl did put
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
in a search charge for for um EV
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
purchases I think it was $50 or $100 I
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't if you know remember the details
 
01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it's $1100 for electric vehicles
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
and $50 for um hybrid electric
 
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles so and I believe that generates
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the order of about $
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
million I know Department of Safety Conn
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
collects the revenue um but they I I
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
seem to recall about that amount that
 
01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:41.719 align:start position:0%
that it has um generated to date thank
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
you gentlemen thank you sure
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative Miller thank you Mr ch um
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
your efficiency graph that you shared
 
01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
with us um I note that you're using the
 
01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
number of position itions as you're
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
Staffing not the number of actual staff
 
01:52:59.550 --> 01:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
and with the uh drop in head count you
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
you say you're 24% down right now has
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
that 24% been consistent or is this sort
 
01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
of hiding the fact that you have way
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
fewer people than we did 10 or 15 years
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
ago that it's actually a more dramatic
 
01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
change than what we're seeing in this
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
chart that that's a good observation I
 
01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
think the latter I think I think it is a
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
little more dramatic than this graphic
 
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
may may may imply because we have been
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with a um a fairly consistent
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate that we just haven't been
 
01:53:32.189 --> 01:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
able to um um reduce it usually runs
 
01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
between 20 and
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
24% it's a little bit amassing because
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's not um it's not consistent
 
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
there are some there are some areas
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
there are some bureaus that are fully
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
staffed there are some areas um where we
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
have even more inordinate um vacancies I
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
look at our engineering positions in
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
project development uh which is running
 
01:53:59.950 --> 01:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
around 35 to 40% that's a that's part of
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
an issue with the with the with with
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
with the state and what the state's able
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
to pay but it's also um an industrywide
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
kind of shortage of Engineers coming out
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
of school as well too so I think
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
um yes from our efficiency chart it does
 
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
mask a little bit that we are uh have
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
have even less people than than what
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
what what we show on that chart
 
01:54:27.629 --> 01:54:27.639 align:start position:0%
continuing to R to get everything done
 
01:54:31.709 --> 01:54:31.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pont thank you
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um on slide six I noticed that
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh we show uh over half a million
 
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
dollars in uh revenue from
 
01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
Aviation but nothing I don't see
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
anything for rail or public transit do
 
01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
we recruit any do you know any revenues
 
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
coming in from rail or or uh public
 
01:54:54.669 --> 01:54:54.679 align:start position:0%
transit um on on on rail we do get it's
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars a year of
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue as part of the um uh operating
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
agreements uh for um operators and and
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
the and the Rail lines running on on
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
state lines part of that um is is plowed
 
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
back into maintenance of of those those
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
lines working with the working with the
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
um operators of those lines um so
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
relatively meager rail um
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue that that comes from that but it
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
is it is something uh public transit uh
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
we do not get any revenue for that um
 
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um BX uh the Boston Express
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
um uh line that that that we run we
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
subsidize that uh there is fair boox
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue but the fair boox doesn't cover
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
the operating cost as and and that's
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
been a slow recovery since co uh Andre
 
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
wanted me to make sure I mentioned the
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh the P3 we just recently had a um
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
public private partnership with uh C&amp;J
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
Trailways to run and operate the um
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Dover Park and Ride
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
Transportation facilities so that is a
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh that will be a source of of Revenue
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
we have a base rent and then there is
 
01:56:16.589 --> 01:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
some Revenue sharing on on top of that
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
um um yeah so that that is
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
a um I I'm hopeful that'll be a very
 
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
successful project because it's turned
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know what had kind of been a
 
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance drain a a a a um uh you know
 
01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
a negative cost for us into a positive
 
01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:37.639 align:start position:0%
so thank you may have a followup Mr CH
 
01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
quick followup yes um I understand that
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
the the toll plazas would be under your
 
01:56:45.149 --> 01:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction with the new plazas and
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
cars just driving through can you tell
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
me are we seeing a loss in revenues are
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
we of vehicles that are excessively
 
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
going on uh over the 65 miles that's
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
required is there any loss of Revenue
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
there no no there's no loss of Revenue
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
and we make up we we the fee structure
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
for um um violations and and things like
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
that as is purposely looked at and
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
reviewed to um make up and cover for
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
those costs of collections thank you
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair okay one more final
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
question representative Hill thank you
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for your
 
01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:23.030 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for your
presentation

01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
I've never got so much negative com com
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
comments on um social media this weekend
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:57:30.159 --> 01:57:32.350 align:start position:0%
from the
do

01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't even know how to describe it
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
but a weather forecast that that
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
seemingly uh I was getting comments that
 
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
people were asking if it was hacked um
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
but it shows a a guy with a head coming
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
out of the toilet driving the the car um
 
01:57:53.069 --> 01:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
is this is this some kind of um attempt
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
to um get closer to Millennials or
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah you that would
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
that was it I can send you an article
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
there was a good article uh in the um in
 
01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
the uh where did I see it in the in the
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
paper did did did did did compare so you
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
know part of it was marketing part of it
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
was to um have a socially engaging
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
message uh uh lean into some of the
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
current trends and and try to get that
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
um um feedback and from a marketing
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
perspective well it's not something
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to do all all the time the
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
reaction to it the number of views the
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
number of reposts um were um were were
 
01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
very successful were very were very high
 
01:58:40.589 --> 01:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
so while it was a lot of feedback a
 
01:58:44.069 --> 01:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
around the way the message was was was
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
conveyed at least there were a lot more
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
eyes that were seeing the the me the
 
01:58:48.119 --> 01:58:49.109 align:start position:0%
eyes that were seeing the the me the
message

01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
message
 
01:58:52.109 --> 01:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
to uh you know watch for weather and dve
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
D drive slow um it we we did it's it's
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
interesting there was a we did a very
 
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
conventional social media post the day
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
before intentionally to do a comparison
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
with that um uh you know with that more
 
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
socially trended post the next day and
 
01:59:14.589 --> 01:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
the comparison in terms of views and
 
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
stuff were were night and day so um so
 
01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
we'll see
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
more well yeah I we we we want to try to
 
01:59:27.149 --> 01:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
reach as many people as as as as we can
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
I won't say it will be all all that way
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
but we try to have a um broad spectrum
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
of messaging to engage as many folks as
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
we can thank you you're
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr commissioner for uh
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
coming uh since your team was in here
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
could you just introduce them to us so
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
we know who they are because some of
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
them did come up and answer a question
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
yep so um Dave rodrigue was the
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner uh and chief

development Andre is the Deputy
 
02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
Commissioner uh he oversees all of the
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
non-highway and Bridge Transportation
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
assets Aeronautics Rail and Transit as
 
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
well as the policy and
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
administration uh with me is uh Steve
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
lante who is our um legislative liaison
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
um he's going to be kind of the point
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
person for interacting with the
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee and and um you know he
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
monitors and tracks all of the bills and
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
and things that we're uh following and
 
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
things like that and Lee bronis is the
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh administrator of the Bureau of
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
traffic who do um all of the the signing

striping signals and um he may be a
 
02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%

02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
of your constituents if there is a
 
02:04:19.709 --> 02:04:19.719 align:start position:0%
concern we run an autocap program which

is a Consumer complaint program um so uh
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
folks can call in um and then we uh try
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
and bridge the gap with what is usually
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
a communication difference uh the
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
customer just didn't know what tires for
 
02:04:34.750 --> 02:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
life really meant or the message wasn't
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
making it to the right decision maker in
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
the sales office or the fni office so we
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
can help bridge that communication so it
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't escalate so the consumer is
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%

e

02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.640 --> 02:20:19.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:49.630 align:start position:0%

02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
I guess uh I still need to be public for
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
this um I hope everybody thought that uh
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
the presentations this morning were
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
valuable we have a lot of
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
information uh we do have the pleasure
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
of dealing with a lot of good people so
 
02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
we've got that going for us um as you
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
can see I didn't keep today very
 
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
structured uh I figured if I did we'd be
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
here till 2:30 3 o' with all the people
 
02:21:47.230 --> 02:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
we heard from so doing it like this we
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
actually got a lot of info uh the only
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
thing I got left for today just for
 
02:21:53.790 --> 02:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee sake um I do have a list of
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
things we can run through in terms of
 
02:21:58.110 --> 02:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
how this committee operates or most
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
here I'll go through these I'll read
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
them and uh share my opinion if I have
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
have one if we have any questions or
 
02:22:24.750 --> 02:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
your opinion let me
 
02:22:28.990 --> 02:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
know um start time and notices of
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
absence so obviously check the calendar
 
02:22:33.790 --> 02:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
every week uh for the start times of our
 
02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
hearings or executive
 
02:22:38.469 --> 02:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
sessions as you'll notice uh with a rule
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
change from last week uh if you see a
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
disclaimer in the calendar we do have
 
02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
the ability to fill in any downtime uh
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
by executing bills that we've either
 
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
heard that day or
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
previously um I think for just for the
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of the new people I think most
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
of you that are veterans know I usually
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
schedule everything um best as possible
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
including the exact sessions uh and I do
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
try to I think I've got a pretty good
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
success record on estimating how much
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
time for the hearings too um not all the
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
time but it's not an easy thing to
 
02:23:11.399 --> 02:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
time but it's not an easy thing to
do

02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
um I recommendation for everybody on the
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee single email account used for
 
02:23:19.870 --> 02:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
legislative business uh I was hesitant
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
at first but I have since done it I
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
would strongly recommend using the
 
02:23:26.269 --> 02:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
legislative address for for whatever you
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
do here uh and keep your personal one
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
separate uh believe it or not it could
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
be requested of you one of these days
 
02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
you never know so uh keep everything
 
02:23:39.309 --> 02:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
separate and again don't hesitate to
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
stop me as I run through
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
these uh dress and decorum another rule
 
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
that failed but
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
I we all do our best to look
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
professional I actually underdressed
 
02:23:52.830 --> 02:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
today so if you see me coming in like
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
this with no tie and jeans it's probably
 
02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
because I spent a couple hours on my job
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
before I get here and this is pretty
 
02:24:00.670 --> 02:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
good multi-purpose clothing but it's
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
still an effort uh but I everybody
 
02:24:04.349 --> 02:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
should we should be dressing as
 
02:24:06.110 --> 02:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
professionals there's no doubt about it
 
02:24:08.269 --> 02:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
um today we just had department heads I
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say just but a lot of times um
 
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have members of the public too you
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
know and that's what we're here to do uh
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes we won't be in this
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
room um I don't think we have the
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity this year uh but we have in
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
the past had U public hearings in the
 
02:24:29.309 --> 02:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
Hall of reps with 250 300 people I mean
 
02:24:31.230 --> 02:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
so it can
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
happen food coffee and lunch breaks all
 
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
right this is where I do chime in a
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
little bit um water is okay and and as
 
02:24:43.469 --> 02:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
you can see even if it's something other
 
02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
than water I ask you that you keep it
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
down below the table these benches
 
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
actually the tables do have these little
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
convenience shelves underneath I just
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
think and again not today where this is
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
informal today but when we have hearings
 
02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
going on or exec sessions I try to keep
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
drinks and stuff off the table I think
 
02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
it looks a lot better food obviously
 
02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
we're not eating food unless we do a
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
special lunch uh for the committee but
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh obviously again back to that
 
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
professional um appearance use of
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
electronic devices this has been a
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
matter of contention for years uh some
 
02:25:21.269 --> 02:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
in the past would say no anything no
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
laptops no phones I have seen that
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
decision come down from the speaker
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
office in the past there is no such Rule
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
now it's up to
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
us I guess I'll say let's go for it you
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
can use them they are a good resource
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
but again keep in mind when people are
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
speaking to us it doesn't always look
 
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
good if we have a I prefer not to see
 
02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
laptops tablets or phones I get it uh
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to use your laptop
 
02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
be be sparing about it
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
we are trying to listen to the people
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
that are here
 
02:25:56.349 --> 02:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll leave it at that and if
 
02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
we see anything happening I'll make
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
mention of it but uh use of electronic
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
devices we just covered fora committee
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
for our new folks in the in the office
 
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
we do have some cabinets uh some filing
 
02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
draws they're good size um I
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
believe actually let me back up I've
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
been remiss our committee researcher is
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Brad grin and I apologize
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
Brad and in the office out this door to
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
the right in office
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
2011a millenial not a j z um is our
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
committee assistant um Karen
 
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
Davis yeah she can come in and introduce
 
02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
herself sure uh and I can ask her a
 
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
question at the same time or maybe you
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
know are all the names been updated on
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
the filing cabinets yes we'll take a
 
02:26:49.469 --> 02:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
look afterwards for everybody just to
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
make sure you've got your your own dra
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
allotted to you you've already got yours
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
I've checked okay so I'm assuming that's
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
these people are right on top of
 
02:27:01.830 --> 02:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
it um I will be assigning a member for
 
02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:02.910 align:start position:0%
it um I will be assigning a member for
security

02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
notifications unfortunately he just left
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully we're good for the
 
02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
day and fire alarm exit in our room I'll
 
02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody can see it posted
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
clearly what happens how to get out of
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
here if there's an
 
02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
emergency Okay so committee our partisan
 
02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
balance is nine Republicans and seven
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
Democrats this is a big switch for
 
02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
transportation I've been here since 2013
 
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
or 2012 election and it was always a 20
 
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
member committee so with the development
 
02:27:38.910 --> 02:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
of a second education committee you know
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
and and a good number of people that
 
02:27:42.389 --> 02:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
didn't want any committee that's why the
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
decision was to reduce some of the
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
numbers um where they could I don't know
 
02:27:48.910 --> 02:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
might make our life easier might not I
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
guess we'll see how it goes
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh but that is the that is the uh the
 
02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
uh but that is the that is the uh the
split

02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
split
 
02:27:57.550 --> 02:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
97 uh everybody good with the seat I
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
gave you today this was just a a rough
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
one I try to mix everybody up no
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
objections then I guess we'll leave the
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
is typical Bill
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
topics well as you get into this you
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
will probably see that the majority of
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
our bills or what's called Title 20 uh
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle Laws I won't go too far
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
into that right now we you'll see you're
 
02:28:24.190 --> 02:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
going to get one book of statutes it
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
contains Title 20 I'd say 99% of the
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
bills that we 95 95% of 95% of the bills
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
we cover are within Title 20
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
work we will be getting well we usually
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
do um again we haven't got bills yet
 
02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
probably not even close uh second bills
 
02:28:56.309 --> 02:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
that will require us to act go to the
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
floor and then go to a second committee
 
02:28:59.950 --> 02:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
usually it's either Finance if it's got
 
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note possibly uh criminal
 
02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
justice or Judiciary if it if it changes
 
02:29:09.150 --> 02:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh penalties substantially so you may
 
02:29:11.389 --> 02:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
see some of those types of bills we'll
 
02:29:13.830 --> 02:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
deal with those first as soon as I get
 
02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
all the bills I'll let everybody know
 
02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
which ones are considered early um
 
02:29:20.399 --> 02:29:21.389 align:start position:0%
which ones are considered early um
um

02:29:21.389 --> 02:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittees we'll deal with that as we
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
go we can have we can and do have the
 
02:29:29.230 --> 02:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
ability if we have bills in particular
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
that we kind of like the idea but know
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
it needs work we can at at our exec
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
sessions or um yeah the exact session
 
02:29:40.110 --> 02:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
would be the appropriate Place request
 
02:29:42.190 --> 02:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and we can do groups of
 
02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
usually odd number three five people if
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
they want to uh if if there's a desire
 
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
to study a bill uh and work on it toing
 
02:29:52.030 --> 02:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
bring it back to this committee the full
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
committee to vote on it before it goes
 
02:29:56.269 --> 02:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
to the floor and I'm just going through
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
these quick any questions don't worry
 
02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
there's more there'll be plenty of
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh calendar notices I think
 
02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned our Bible weekly um I
 
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
generally do not reach out to the
 
02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:12.710 align:start position:0%
generally do not reach out to the
committee

02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:30:16.750 --> 02:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
personally um via email um I know we're
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
allowed for notifications and such uh
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
without any violations to 91a but I
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
still think it's simpler um this is what
 
02:30:28.750 --> 02:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
I use to reach out to you um uh I I
 
02:30:31.469 --> 02:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
think it works better it's more
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
efficient Bill files do not leave the
 
02:30:36.309 --> 02:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
building that would be more for me
 
02:30:38.190 --> 02:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
because obviously the bills you've been
 
02:30:40.269 --> 02:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
issued can leave the building they're
 
02:30:44.349 --> 02:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
yours by the way um this is only 15 of
 
02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
them right now we have 24 that have
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
already been
 
02:30:49.349 --> 02:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
issued uh I just heard this morning
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
there are still
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
I think he said better than 200 that
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
have not even been assigned
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
yet then I also heard um and they're
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
pretty good at usually figuring out
 
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
where they go based on Title
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
20 I wouldn't be surprised if and and
 
02:31:07.710 --> 02:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
agree with DMV that we probably get 45
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
which is not the most we've had we had
 
02:31:13.950 --> 02:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
54 last year I think I mean I was very
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
happy with the 24 I don't know about the
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
rescue but but we'll see what happens uh
 
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll and in terms of scheduling I
 
02:31:23.950 --> 02:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
I'll bring this up now while we're
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
bills I generally like to have them all
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
so that when I do my scheduling I can
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
group them together by theme so that you
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
know a lot of the people are testify of
 
02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
the same ones and we're we're into it
 
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know you've seen it before we have
 
02:31:40.750 --> 02:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
bills that multiple bills that touch on
 
02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
the same thing I have without having all
 
02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
of them I'm hesitant on scheduling
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
anything for next
 
02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
week uh but I may do that and and on
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
that note Tuesday is going to be the day
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
we meet um it's always been Sophia
 
02:32:00.030 --> 02:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
planning purposes Tuesday is our
 
02:32:00.040 --> 02:32:04.910 align:start position:0%
planning purposes Tuesday is our
day

02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:06.990 --> 02:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
um committee
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
oh well the ranking member and both the
 
02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
vice chair we know about the committee
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
replacement policy if you can't make it
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.750 --> 02:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
basically El executive sessions because
 
02:32:24.110 --> 02:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
there's really no need to replace
 
02:32:26.469 --> 02:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
yourself for a day just at has public
 
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
hearings uh you do need to let the
 
02:32:31.469 --> 02:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
respective offices know whether it's
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
democrat or republican the day before
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
before they close otherwise they cannot
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
assign any
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
Replacements all right let's touch on
 
02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
public hearings for a minute next excuse
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
drink I have seen in the past public
 
02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
hearings we had a member in the past I
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
won't mention any names who thought that
 
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
the public hearings we had were modeled
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
on um
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
investigatory panels or uh meetings
 
02:33:08.910 --> 02:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
commissions of the United States Senate
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
and the way they grilled people sitting
 
02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
at that table that's not what we do here
 
02:33:17.150 --> 02:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
um we're here to listen to what they
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
have to offer and ask questions of them
 
02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
what's relative to the bill we don't get
 
02:33:26.590 --> 02:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
into debates with the public um there a
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
little levity but if it's a department
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
head but but for the most part it's just
 
02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
a sharing of information they tell us
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
and we can ask them if they're willing
 
02:33:37.469 --> 02:33:37.479 align:start position:0%
to take questions uh but no speeches
 
02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
during public hearings when you're
 
02:33:41.269 --> 02:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
asking questions if you've been called
 
02:33:44.349 --> 02:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
to ask a question uh no time for speech
 
02:33:47.389 --> 02:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
is there that literally is uh asking
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
through the chair uh to a question of
 
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
who's ever at that
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
table um you'll see I'm fair with giving
 
02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
questions probably fairer than most U
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
but if I'm looking at the clock and if I
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
if I start saying no to more questions
 
02:34:04.510 --> 02:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
it's only because I'm looking ahead and
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
and if we don't stop we're going to get
 
02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
in trouble the clock does run everything
 
02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
eventually um but you you'll you'll
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
catch it for those of you that knew not
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
been through this um
 
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
speeches that's you have a little more
 
02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for that when we're debating
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
the bill in the committee and that's the
 
02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
executive session whole different rules
 
02:34:27.150 --> 02:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
in executive session um you still got to
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
go through the chair but that's your
 
02:34:31.150 --> 02:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for debate opportunity
 
02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for speeches and again I
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
mention it questions go through the
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
chair um and if you need a second
 
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
question you should you know ask for a
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
second question and U basically
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
everything goes through me or the vice
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
chair when he's sitting here
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
here when the sponsor is a member of the
 
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee all right so if you have a
 
02:34:59.710 --> 02:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
bill and I think you do that'll be
 
02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:00.590 align:start position:0%
bill and I think you do that'll be
coming

02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:35:03.020 --> 02:35:03.030 align:start position:0%
here okay so what happens if
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:05.030 align:start position:0%
here okay so what happens if
[Music]

02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
you I'll I'll do the sponsor first if
 
02:35:12.030 --> 02:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
you are a sponsor of a bill and you go
 
02:35:13.830 --> 02:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
up and you're on this committee you'll
 
02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
go up to that table introduce the bill
 
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
like everybody else does but that's your
 
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
bite at the Apple
 
02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
and and so you won't be returning to
 
02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
your seat unless it's a full house I
 
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
might make an exception to let you back
 
02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
to your seat but that's only because
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's a full house generally if I
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
introduce one of my bills I stay out in
 
02:35:32.590 --> 02:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
the gallery because that's the last time
 
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
I get to speak on it uh and that applies
 
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
to everybody if it's a full house I'll
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
let you come back over here but if you
 
02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
come and sit down it's not to ask
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions it's not to offer any more
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
testimony it's just how it works um
 
02:35:46.349 --> 02:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors are different if you're a
 
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on a
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
bill and you don't don't go to that
 
02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
table it's okay if you ask questions of
 
02:35:56.910 --> 02:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
the witnesses that are there um so
 
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
there's no there's pretty everybody
 
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
clear on that it's it's it's pretty much
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
common sense um and again a lot of these
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
things I'm going through because this is
 
02:36:08.510 --> 02:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
my outline as we get into it you see how
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:15.269 --> 02:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
sense yeah okay yeah I already mentioned
 
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
this action on the bill same days of
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
hearing rule 44b we do have the ability
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
to do that now I promise I will not be
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
abusing it but if it's uh bills that we
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
think we can just dispose of with no
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
Fanfare and a little debate just to get
 
02:36:30.510 --> 02:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
them out of if we're in agreement
 
02:36:33.230 --> 02:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
basically uh we it might come in handy
 
02:36:37.389 --> 02:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
um again I am of the thought process of
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
longer days just fewer I hope everybody
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
can go along with that
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
because everybody's time is important so
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest in recusal
 
02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
111 sorry we passed a it's you've all
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
filled out your financial disclosure
 
02:37:05.710 --> 02:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
forms you also have a new one to fill
 
02:37:07.950 --> 02:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
out before Friday I don't know if all of
 
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
you have done it get on the portal or
 
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
get into the
 
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
portal the one you filled out at the
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
very beginning is not the last one now
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
we have a new one um
 
02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:27.670 --> 02:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
more what's that charie charliie
 
02:37:30.510 --> 02:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
especially uh so there's no way I'm
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
going to go into it at this depth now I
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
would suggest reading everything that's
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
there there are going to be more up for
 
02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
more times that recusal may be something
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
you need to do depending on the new law
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
so I instead of getting we could talk
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
about this for hours I will just make
 
02:37:49.269 --> 02:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
mention that you need to look into this
 
02:37:49.279 --> 02:37:50.469 align:start position:0%
mention that you need to look into this
uh

02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
um and we'll see how it goes like this
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
is a new law we're going to see how it
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
rolls out but with conflicts of interest
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
and recusal in this new bill it's a
 
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
possibility that that some may have to
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
do it more often than they thought in
 
02:38:05.469 --> 02:38:05.479 align:start position:0%
the past and that could be up for debate
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
too I guess with with the administration
 
02:38:09.710 --> 02:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
but we'll see how it goes I just want to
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
make make you aware that we did make a
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.269 --> 02:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
year EX
 
02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
sessions no public input without the
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
chair's consent
 
02:38:25.950 --> 02:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
meaning uh when we go into executive
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
session it's it's our time um the only
 
02:38:32.269 --> 02:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
time somebody in the gallery will chime
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
in is if I allow them because we have a
 
02:38:38.110 --> 02:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
question and that's more than fine but
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a time for more public uh input
 
02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
or public hearings it's specifically for
 
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
information during that executive
 
02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:48.070 align:start position:0%
information during that executive
session

02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:38:50.429 --> 02:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
process anybody have any questions on
 
02:38:50.439 --> 02:38:51.950 align:start position:0%
process anybody have any questions on
amendments

02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:38:54.670 --> 02:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
because well I'll go through it if you
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
want to amend the
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill you need to go to
 
02:39:02.429 --> 02:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
ol ol the only amendments we will take
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
here are by committee members or can
 
02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
take here by committee members prepared
 
02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:07.790 align:start position:0%
take here by committee members prepared
by

02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
OS once you've seen the amendment then
 
02:39:12.590 --> 02:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
you request that that gets sent up to
 
02:39:15.309 --> 02:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
committee Services committee services
 
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
will make the appropriate amount of
 
02:39:19.710 --> 02:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
copies for the committee and bring them
 
02:39:23.309 --> 02:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
down to us so that's basically the
 
02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
process I don't think I'm missing
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
anything of I I would specifically say
 
02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
that you should be aware you should be
 
02:39:32.590 --> 02:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
aware of any
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
am it's helpful now any amendments if
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
you heard that any amendments uh well
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
the chair does have the ability to
 
02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
recognize them or not um I don't
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
normally have an issue with that but uh
 
02:39:50.349 --> 02:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
it I guess like anything else I try to
 
02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
keep open communication with the ranking
 
02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
member uh just it's helpful for
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
everybody if we all do the same if you
 
02:39:58.110 --> 02:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
get an amendment coming on a bill the
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
more people know about it the better off
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
nobody likes surprises I guess in other
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
words uh so anyway no public input
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
without chair's consent uh amendments
 
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
prepared by OS if you have any other
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions or any hesitation on how to
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%

02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
everything we can to help you uh
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
motions we have
 
02:40:24.269 --> 02:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
um well three motions um in expedient to
 
02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislate is if you don't want the bill
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
to move forward op to pass if you
 
02:40:31.510 --> 02:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
do we'll get into the parliament the
 
02:40:33.150 --> 02:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
first executive session will be an eye
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
opener for those of who have never done
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
it if none of our new members have never
 
02:40:39.710 --> 02:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
done it uh on some of the other motions
 
02:40:41.389 --> 02:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
um we can do
 
02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
reconsideration uh we can go through the
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
whole gambut of everything we would do
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the house floor for the most part
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't table a bill here can
 
02:40:56.910 --> 02:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
we no we we also
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
have right right we we almost were able
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
to table them we do have another couple
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
of options with bills in the fir well in
 
02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
the first year we can set up to what's
 
02:41:08.349 --> 02:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
called interim study if we truly believe
 
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
that that U no retained sorry U retained
 
02:41:15.309 --> 02:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
on the first year and we do that is
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
exactly what it means it won't go to the
 
02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
floor um there'll be no committee report
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
on it we will keep the bill and work on
 
02:41:25.710 --> 02:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
it until the following year of the
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
bium uh and then we'll have to dispose
 
02:41:30.429 --> 02:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
on it dispose of it and then the second
 
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
year interim
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
study uh yeah Tech it is what it is it's
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
also called death With Dignity but
 
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see how this works when we get to
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:51.389 --> 02:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
we can adopt amendments in committee by
 
02:41:57.870 --> 02:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote but all votes for the
 
02:41:59.590 --> 02:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation will be done by
 
02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:01.389 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation will be done by
roll

02:42:01.389 --> 02:42:01.399 align:start position:0%
roll
 
02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
call after we vote on a bill uh we do
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
have to uh create a committee
 
02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:09.830 align:start position:0%
have to uh create a committee
report

02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
so I tend to whoever gets makes the
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
motion ask the person to come up with
 
02:42:16.830 --> 02:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:42:19.950 --> 02:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
report if it's not a unanimous bill then
 
02:42:22.349 --> 02:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
obviously that's the opportunity for the
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
minority to offer their Minority Report
 
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
and both of those reports have to be I
 
02:42:29.230 --> 02:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
want them that
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
day um they do get proof read by several
 
02:42:34.030 --> 02:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
people first myself uh then they go
 
02:42:36.030 --> 02:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
through committee Services ultimately
 
02:42:38.670 --> 02:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
they get looked at Again by the speaker
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:41.349 align:start position:0%
and the
clerk

02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
um once again it's basically just a
 
02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
reporting and an explanation to the Full
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
House of what we did and why we did it
 
02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
um when I'm just going through this when
 
02:42:57.269 --> 02:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
we get to that point I will gladly work
 
02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
with anybody who's never done one um
 
02:43:03.309 --> 02:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
just to make it easier and then you'll
 
02:43:05.309 --> 02:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
also start seeing them in the calendar
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
when you start seeing how some of these
 
02:43:08.590 --> 02:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
other ones look that'll give you a gauge
 
02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
on on what they should look like but
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
better we again I do I did mention we we
 
02:43:22.510 --> 02:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
have Brad as our researcher and Karen is
 
02:43:25.070 --> 02:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
our assistant they are here to help us
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
but they also help a bunch of other
 
02:43:29.550 --> 02:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
committees as well if you need or would
 
02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
request that they give you a hand on
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
something that's relative to this
 
02:43:34.990 --> 02:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
committee only that request still needs
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
to come through me um otherwise if if 16
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
people from four different five
 
02:43:41.550 --> 02:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
different committees were going after
 
02:43:43.150 --> 02:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
them all at once uh they would be
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed so it's just a matter of
 
02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
keeping some order and keeping some uh
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
some sanity through the process
 
02:43:53.630 --> 02:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
us uh and they do our committee work
 
02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
only I think I mentioned
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
that we're almost done folks remember
 
02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
resources uh we do have administrative
 
02:44:04.349 --> 02:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
support on the fourth floor I strongly
 
02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
recommend to anybody that's new never
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
hesitate going up to the fourth floor
 
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
and asking questions U that's the one
 
02:44:12.190 --> 02:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
thing that makes this whole place work
 
02:44:15.510 --> 02:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
is the staff that we have up there
 
02:44:19.870 --> 02:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
um we do have statutes here um
 
02:44:21.590 --> 02:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
on top of the filing cabin in the back
 
02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
room you'll also see I believe those are
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
up to date probably the last 15 years of
 
02:44:29.710 --> 02:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
updates to Title 20 you know our related
 
02:44:31.870 --> 02:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
book um obviously there are complete
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
statutes because I don't think these
 
02:44:35.309 --> 02:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
have been maintained that well up on the
 
02:44:35.319 --> 02:44:37.190 align:start position:0%
have been maintained that well up on the
fourth

02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
02:44:41.070 --> 02:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
floor computer level in our old smoking
 
02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
room uh yes we did have one up until not
 
02:44:45.230 --> 02:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
too long
 
02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
ago what's that on the fourth floor of
 
02:44:51.630 --> 02:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
the L smoking room yes I mean a computer
 
02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:56.190 align:start position:0%
the L smoking room yes I mean a computer
room

02:44:56.190 --> 02:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh okay uh I do have the password for
 
02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
the internet access if you need it it
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
should be pretty much everybody's got it
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
it the rest of the things I have here
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
are just phone numbers for the clerk for
 
02:45:14.670 --> 02:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
Richard Lambert Ethics Committee
 
02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
executive director and for an Fitzgerald
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
who uh is lead staff at house committee
 
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
services that is all I've got is just a
 
02:45:29.309 --> 02:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
rough description of how this all works
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative gski do you have
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
anything yeah I just I think one of the
 
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
things that makes this committee great
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
is the collegiality that we may have
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion but this is a
 
02:45:44.910 --> 02:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
really great committee that you know we
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
like to kind of keep that that culture
 
02:45:50.030 --> 02:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
so I think the key thing here so we we
 
02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
treat each other with respect um and you
 
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
know there could be differences of
 
02:45:57.190 --> 02:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
opinion but I think this is what makes
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
this committee one of the best ones I
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
believe um we can just kind of keep that
 
02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
fantastic anybody else represent St
 
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
Clair I just a quick question any is
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
there anything going on with the
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses being not used for
 
02:46:16.910 --> 02:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
other information you know with that
 
02:46:18.990 --> 02:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
strip on the back and we talked about
 
02:46:21.150 --> 02:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
that we had a bill last year on that is
 
02:46:22.469 --> 02:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
there do you know of anything coming
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
down the pike on that this year
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
area so this is where they uh you go
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
it I tried to introduce a bill last year
 
02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
regarding that uh another person had so
 
02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't let me introduce mine I did
 
02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
see one I'm not I don't know if it get
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
signed off on but I in the early LSR
 
02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
stage I saw that there was a bill to
 
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
prohibit the scanning of alcohol and
 
02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:57.309 align:start position:0%
prohibit the scanning of alcohol and
tobacco

02:46:57.309 --> 02:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
02:46:59.790 --> 02:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
products which is the only Bill I've
 
02:47:01.389 --> 02:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
seen so far which is actually all I
 
02:47:03.630 --> 02:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
wanted out of mine uh but the one that
 
02:47:06.990 --> 02:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
got let in instead of mine went quite a
 
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
ways away I don't know if you remember
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
that I I met every lobbyist in this
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
building people I haven't seen in years
 
02:47:17.429 --> 02:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
over that one bill that was brutal but
 
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's the only one I know of and I
 
02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
haven't got it
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
yet uh another interesting too uh
 
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
interesting one too speaking of bills I
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with somebody with a
 
02:47:29.389 --> 02:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
full-blown repeal of the inspection
 
02:47:29.399 --> 02:47:30.550 align:start position:0%
full-blown repeal of the inspection
program

02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
again I haven't seen it I don't know if
 
02:47:36.429 --> 02:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
something happened I don't know if he
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
missed the
 
02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
deadline it could be in the 200 but then
 
02:47:41.469 --> 02:47:41.479 align:start position:0%
again I looked in all the lsrs too I
 
02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
didn't see it so uh it's a possibility
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh that I did see it but that doesn't
 
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
mean it made it you know with all the
 
02:47:49.550 --> 02:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
deadlines and sign Ops and everything
 
02:47:53.710 --> 02:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
technically uh caucuses um again he's a
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
partisan so um basically how it works
 
02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm the the neutral as the chair of
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
the neutral person in in in the room uh
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
the ranking member will manage the
 
02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
caucuses for the Democrats and the vice
 
02:48:14.670 --> 02:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
chairman organizes caucuses for the
 
02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
Republicans um usually we'll take this
 
02:48:19.870 --> 02:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
room for our caucus
 
02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:21.670 align:start position:0%
room for our caucus
um

02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
and we do share time to time and then
 
02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
the Democrats can take the
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
office we've always been pretty flexible
 
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how many rooms are going
 
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
to be available so if you think
 
02:48:38.110 --> 02:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
there if you don't want the office if
 
02:48:40.830 --> 02:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
you think it's too small uh we may I'll
 
02:48:42.590 --> 02:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
have to check in with with Karen to see
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
if we need to schedule rooms for
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
caucuses but we haven't had to up until
 
02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
this point usually just to sneak in
 
02:48:51.630 --> 02:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
empty room for 15 20 minutes but but
 
02:48:53.269 --> 02:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
those are the two people responsible for
 
02:48:57.190 --> 02:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
them uh when you do them is up to you um
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of on we'll we'll we'll talk
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
later uh on
 
02:49:04.590 --> 02:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
further further information on the
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
caucuses what am I fetting go ahead you
 
02:49:09.429 --> 02:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned executive sessions earlier are
 
02:49:11.349 --> 02:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
those still televised public record or
 
02:49:13.790 --> 02:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
are those private okay they are public
 
02:49:15.469 --> 02:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
well they're televised everything we do
 
02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
is stream now uh but if the cameras go
 
02:49:19.870 --> 02:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
out we don't stop and that's why the
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
public record still is officially the
 
02:49:24.269 --> 02:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
clerk's notes um that's another reason I
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
didn't do any hearings today because I
 
02:49:28.830 --> 02:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
knew she was out of state U I usually
 
02:49:30.670 --> 02:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
try to fill the afternoon up on
 
02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
organization days with hearings but with
 
02:49:35.229 --> 02:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
with a few people missing and not having
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
all the bills that's why I figured we'd
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
have a nice easy
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
day anybody
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
else well I think you've heard me rant
 
02:49:44.910 --> 02:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
long enough for those of you that don't
 
02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
know me I try to keep it light here uh I
 
02:49:49.469 --> 02:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
do let the I do watch the CL pretty good
 
02:49:52.030 --> 02:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
but in terms of how we uh how we
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
interact we need to laugh occasionally
 
02:49:57.309 --> 02:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
so that's uh been the been the tradition
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
here and hopefully we can keep it up so
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
I will ponder actually we could be
 
02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
getting bills issued to us right now I
 
02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:07.349 align:start position:0%
getting bills issued to us right now I
don't

02:50:07.349 --> 02:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
know and I and I would just say watch
 
02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:11.190 align:start position:0%
know and I and I would just say watch
the

02:50:11.190 --> 02:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
calendar about any public hearings for
 
02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday if I want to give you as
 
02:50:16.479 --> 02:50:20.950 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday if I want to give you as
odds

02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
70% chance we'll be doing some hearings
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday and I know it's not a good
 
02:50:25.630 --> 02:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
way to do this but I really want to see
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
02:50:27.279 --> 02:50:29.309 align:start position:0%
the whole
pile

02:50:29.309 --> 02:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
pile
 
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
Committee in my committee we end up with
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
a bunch of bills that are perennials
 
02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
um we see them frequently so one of the
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
things I'm asking our researcher to do
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
is to provide us um the last time that
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
it happened a copy of the file I don't
 
02:50:59.030 --> 02:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
know if I I recall from any of the bills
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
in here um whether there were I just
 
02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
want to see what what previous testimony
 
02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
occurred and what happened with the bill
 
02:51:09.710 --> 02:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
so we're not doing kind of what you're
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
just saying whatever happened with that
 
02:51:15.870 --> 02:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
bill that had the um I don't know if I
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
saw ones that are back from last term
 
02:51:22.429 --> 02:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
but I think it's helpful for especially
 
02:51:26.229 --> 02:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
those for that aren't here now um or
 
02:51:28.990 --> 02:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
that weren't there then to catch up
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat I I'll look at that
 
02:51:34.030 --> 02:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
specifically it's a good idea um I
 
02:51:35.910 --> 02:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
thought I saw one that was a return oh
 
02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah well one that is a return from last
 
02:51:41.030 --> 02:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
year is uh eliminating the first year
 
02:51:42.670 --> 02:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
inspections that's a repeat I don't
 
02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
think the text has changed at all so we
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
can get that
 
02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
information um if the
 
02:51:51.910 --> 02:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
full-blown repeal of the program gets
 
02:51:55.150 --> 02:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
found or if it actually did get filed I
 
02:51:56.830 --> 02:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
I can do the same thing with that
 
02:51:58.229 --> 02:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
however I was told that this one was
 
02:52:00.830 --> 02:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
going to be doing a pretty deep dive
 
02:52:02.750 --> 02:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
into all the statutes including the
 
02:52:05.550 --> 02:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
references on that repeal that one could
 
02:52:08.990 --> 02:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
be a beauty so uh if anybody else
 
02:52:11.150 --> 02:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
notices uh bills
 
02:52:14.469 --> 02:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
that well we don't have window ENT bills
 
02:52:17.349 --> 02:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
this year so that takes care that that
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
perennial uh I haven't seen a uh outou
 
02:52:23.950 --> 02:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
ofate plates on outou ofate trailers
 
02:52:26.030 --> 02:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
getting license plates yet so that that
 
02:52:29.550 --> 02:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:29.560 --> 02:52:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
perennial

02:52:31.349 --> 02:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
perennial
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
driver driver's license um I haven't
 
02:52:36.510 --> 02:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
seen the 15 we've got I'll flip through
 
02:52:39.389 --> 02:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
them later there's a couple drivers last
 
02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
oh that's right that's another one yes
 
02:52:44.990 --> 02:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
BS that's that I don't I haven't looked
 
02:52:46.830 --> 02:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
at the Lang language yet but that
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:58.269 --> 02:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
y go ahead Brad oh that's right another
 
02:53:03.870 --> 02:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:06.910 --> 02:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
coal what do they call that Prius
 
02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:08.910 align:start position:0%
coal what do they call that Prius
repellent

02:53:08.910 --> 02:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
repellent
 
02:53:12.389 --> 02:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yes so we do have some fun yeah the
 
02:53:15.070 --> 02:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
more than I thought that are coming back
 
02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:19.910 align:start position:0%
more than I thought that are coming back
so

02:53:19.910 --> 02:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:23.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:53:23.550 --> 02:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right you did you did the
 
02:53:27.630 --> 02:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
majority report on that that's
 
02:53:30.670 --> 02:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
right well that's all I've got again
 
02:53:33.550 --> 02:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
blue envelope is in there too so I don't
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
know if that would have been an ideal to
 
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:48.910 --> 02:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I still have to have a hearing um
 
02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
and we still
 
02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
have or they could withdraw it do you I
 
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
know is partial on that he is he's not
 
02:54:00.429 --> 02:54:00.439 align:start position:0%
oh fogner I think the blue envelope
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
or yeah we brought this to the dmad spor
 
02:54:11.389 --> 02:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
he said I can do
 
02:54:14.110 --> 02:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
this first listed it's in our package
 
02:54:19.670 --> 02:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:21.389 --> 02:54:21.399 align:start position:0%
well all right anything else for the
 
02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
