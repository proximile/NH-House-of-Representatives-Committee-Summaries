Danville um I'm here to introduce House
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 1180 which uh was I was prompted to

file this bill in response to a consumer
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
consumer uh alert issued by the uh
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice um regarding
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
Homestead rights for non-titled spouses
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
there was a recent case that came forth
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
um that kind of turned previous uh
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
decisions with respect to uh Homestead
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
exemptions and bankruptcies and deaths
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
of a spouse um and this went all the way
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
then it was appealed to the local
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
federal court at which time a common law
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
or a non-named spouse on a deed was
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
excluded from uh a homestead exemption
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
uh in the case of a bankruptcy or a
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
death of the spouse this bill is quite
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
simple it would repeal the existing
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph in law and make language
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
changes so that it would be quite clear
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
as to uh that each spouse uh or owner of
 
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.350 align:start position:0%
as to uh that each spouse uh or owner of
the

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
property has that right to claim the
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
homestead exemption in those particular
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
cases um it's as simple as that pretty
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
straightforward I'd be happy to take any
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%

happen in the event that a surviving
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
spouse receiving the this homestead
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
exemption um inherited a major
 
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
Fortune is there
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
any mechanism in this bill that would
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
check the status of that person and
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
whether they continued to qualify uh
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's an
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
excellent question um I'm not prepared
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
to answer that as I don't believe
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
currently that is considered for the
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
homeset exemption as things um as a case
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
courts um representative

power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.519 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
question so I'm seeking some
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
clarification on lines three and five
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
with regards to the claim clim it says
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh on both lines it says the homestead
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
right as to
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
$120,000 on both lines and the word as
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
is unclear to me and I'm wondering if up
 
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.389 align:start position:0%
is unclear to me and I'm wondering if up
to

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%

appropriate uh representative thank you
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%

Lynn drafted this language together and
 
00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:37.959 align:start position:0%
um the language that was that is put
 
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
forth was his language so seeing his um
 
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
or considering his past um history uh I
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
I went with that seeing he's had to
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
historically representative priest thank

current policy or regulations as it

relates and why is this important sure
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
um at this point in time what has
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
happened historically was basically
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
upended in a recent case that went all
 
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
the way to the Supreme Court
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
historically if you had a um a common
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
law couple and one and they entered into
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
a bankruptcy situation um if you were a
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
married couple each individual would get
 
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
married couple each individual would get
a

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
$120,000 exemption uh towards the value
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
of that uh property in a homestead um
 
00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:46.519 align:start position:0%
but the the current statute is quite
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
vague and the uh the federal court
 
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
interpreted that because it was not
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear that each uh each
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
property owner individually and
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
separately gets get that claim um they
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
denied the claim and it went to the New
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court which upheld the
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
federal Court's decision so this is to
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
clarify that in the event that uh uh
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
whether it be a a common law couple or
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
conventional husband and wife or a civil
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
union each individual ought to have
 
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
those rights to their protection of
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
their Assets in a bankruptcy or a death
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
situation representative
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative you keep using the term
 
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
common law does New Hampshire have
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
recognized common law unions or
 
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959 align:start position:0%
marriages or rights um I'm not exactly
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
certain on that it's it's it's kind of a
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
gray area I believe there is a after a
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
seven-year period I believe there are
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
some rights afforded um but the purpose
 
00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
of this is to provide protection for
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
individuals that don't have a
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
conventionally blessed if if you will
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
Union of some sort but yet their rights
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
still exist and this would uh provide
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
protection for
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
those okay thank you you're
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
majority thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I I know the
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
existing law says and you carry it here
 
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
that every person um but then in the
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
next sentence it says the spouse of an
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
owner and I'm just curious if if that
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
specifically can only be the spouse or
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
can it be one of the
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
owners and I'm not sure that I'm not
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
sure that makes perfect sense I was just
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
curious because there it gets very
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
specific to only the spouse but in the
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
sentence before that there can be
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
different owners do you get my point yes
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh I would
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
agree that u in s some circumstances you
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
might have multiple you could have a
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
dozen owners of a particular piece of
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
property but the Homestead Act is
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
clearly designed to protect a husband
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
and wife or a civil union couple type of
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
a situation not a corporation or other
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
um you know a limited liability
 
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank uh representative
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
Howland thank you for taking my question
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
so I just want to clarify so the same
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
rules that apply for you to Grant the in
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
what already is existing the $120,000
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
exemption those would also apply to the
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the additional now
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
$120,000 uh exemption uh in other words
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
I think that's to what representative
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
stavis said if you had like a local to
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
qualify for the exemption you had to
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
make x amount of money or you had a cap
 
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
on that the same rules apply under this
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
you're just doubling potentially the
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
amount they could ask for in the
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
exemption that is correct we're just to
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
make this is just to make sure that each
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
party is protected yeah the and I'm
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
sorry if I'm jumping in it's a just a
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
followup on that it's it's like so in
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
other words the the municipality still
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
has the ability to say no to the
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
exemption and to control when they give
 
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.030 align:start position:0%
exemption and to control when they give
the

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
exemption this is not going to address
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
any of those other areas just
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
the uh specifically uh naming who is
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
eligible for the exemption it doesn't
 
00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
affect the way that it is uh approved or
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
disproved just who's who's entitled to
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
claim this exemption thank
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to follow up on uh
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
representative howland's question and
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
just simplify it that in the bill the uh
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
Homestead right is 120,000 for each
 
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
individual correct so and annually it
 
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
could be 240,000
 
00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759 align:start position:0%
well this is a one time only this would
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
that is not the case this only would
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
happen in the event let's say
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
hypothetically speaking you've got a um
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
a husband wife and they're not able to
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
make their mortgage payments their house
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
is worth
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
$500,000 they've got $300,000 in equity
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
the bank forecloses they are able to as
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
current law has it they would only be
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
able to protect
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
$120,000 of the equity in that property
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
um even though they're married or if
 
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759 align:start position:0%
they're in a married situation they
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
would be protected but if they were
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
unmarried and they both contributed over
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
the years one of them would not be able
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
to claim that exemption only the named
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
individual on the deed this would
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
provide um an additional $120,000 to the
 
00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:37.230 align:start position:0%
provide um an additional $120,000 to the
other

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
co-owner um which is the spirit and the
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
intent of the law and the ACT nationally
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
but this is a hole in our statutes as we
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any further questions
 
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.749 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any further questions
representative

00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
Lal yes thank you for taking my question
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
um the figure of
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
$120,000 do you know how long that has
 
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.749 align:start position:0%
$120,000 do you know how long that has
been

00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
active I do not but we not I'm not
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
seeking to change the the the amount of
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
the exemption uh but I did provide a u a
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
link to
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
um the various Homestead Acts throughout
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
the country and New Hampshire is we're
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
probably in the mid to lower end of the
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
spectrum some states have no limit some
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
states are as low as 15 000 But to
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
answer your question no I don't know how
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
long it's been there but it's been quite
 
00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:34.069 align:start position:0%
long it's been there but it's been quite
some

00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
time follow up Mr chair followup I'm
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we should take
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
advantage of the opportunity to update
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
that figure if indeed it needs to be um
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
I would be open to that and I would
 
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that perhaps the committee
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
should take a look at the link that I
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
sent and uh you know see where we're at
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
presently see where we might be able to
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
go but uh it might be a an opportune
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
time to ratchet that up a bit thank
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
you representative stavis thank you Mr
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking yet
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
another question anytime um just to be
 
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
very clear this homestead exemption does
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
not apply to property
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
taxes no thank
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned about how basically
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
how many individuals can claim on a
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
property I think he answered that my
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
other question is couldn't all of this
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
be avoided by simply ensuring that the
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
name was on a
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
deed that is
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
correct however uh in some instances
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
myself for example I owned my home
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
before I was
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
married okay so when I got married I
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
took the I took the time to put my wife
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
on the deed to ensure that she's
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
protected but people can get busy and
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
they might not consider that so this is
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
designed to lay that groundwork so
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
somebody has protection should they fail
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%

ahead and close the
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
hearing and looks like we got a couple
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.470 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.510 align:start position:0%

savis your question you said it does not
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
apply to something and I did not get the
 
00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:13.110 align:start position:0%
apply to something and I did not get the
that

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:57.230 align:start position:0%

Bill 10:34 relative to enabling
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%

minutes on this bill we have a lot of
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
pink cards I think every one of them

except one is in favor so uh I'm going
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%

add in addition I would ask you to do
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
that do so but make it brief please uh
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of bills we got to get
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
through today so uh just no repetition
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%

long we'll we'll go to a three minute uh
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
maximum with that uh representative
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
Paige Pa thank you Mr
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so my goal here today is a goal
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
that I would hope all of us share which
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
is to reduce the property tax burden on
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
our everyday
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
families and I'm here to Advocate on
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of my constituents in
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
Conway and for everyday people in towns
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
like mine where Market Dynam ICS are
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
pricing local people out of communities
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
where they have spent their entire
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
lives here in New Hampshire we pride
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves on being a low tax
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
state but there's one area where we've
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
lagged our New England neighbors and
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
that is in passing a homestead property
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
tax exemption to provide tax relief
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
needed by local
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
people the bill before you today would
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
provide a local option for
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to exempt a portion of
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
the assessed value of residential real
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
estate from taxation provided that the
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
property is used as the applicant's
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
principal place of
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
residence the exemption would be adopted
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 7227 a following the
 
00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
same procedure as our existing
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
exemptions and critically the bill
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
you're considering today is strictly
 
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.590 align:start position:0%
you're considering today is strictly
enabling

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and I want to be
 
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
upfront and acknowledge that this
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
exemption is not going to be the perfect
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
fit for every
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
Community but even if it's not the fit
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
community it's a Lifeline that my
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Conway
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
need Conway is a great place to live and
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
as many of you probably know it's a
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
great place to to visit but living in a
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
great place to visit is a double-edged
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
sword vacation home buyers and
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
burgeoning short-term rental industry
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
distort our local housing
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
market nearly half of our property tax
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
bills in Conway are mailed out of
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
Conway nearly a quarter of our
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
residential real estate is used for
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
a local option Homestead Property Tax
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
exemption is a vital tool in our tool
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
kit that would Empower municipalities
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
like mine to ensure local people can
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
afford to keep living keep working keep
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
thriving in the community that they
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
love so just a few weeks ago Conway
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
completed our reval and since then my
 
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.430 align:start position:0%
completed our reval and since then my
neighbors

00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
have been writing to me daily I'm sure
 
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
my fellow Conway reps can attest to this
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
they've been getting it too and everyone
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
is expressing their shock and concern at
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
their new property tax bills so
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
following our reval the tax bill on an
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
average single family home went up
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
25% but on a mobile home a whopping
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
75% 75% increase in one
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
year so meanwhile tax bills on local
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
commercial properties have signic ific L
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
decreased so the tax burden in Conway is
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
Shifting further and further onto our
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
lowincome residents this is enormously
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
Solutions one great advantage of a
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
homestead property tax exemption is that
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
delivers relief where it's needed
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
most the greatest tax relief benefit
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
flows to those owning lower valued
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
properties and the benefit phases out as
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
you reach the top of the
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
market we need to stop balancing Our
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
Town budgets on the backs of those least
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
able to afford it but the sad truth of
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
the matter is we currently can't do that
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
we just can't our hands are
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
tied with this exemption municipalities
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
like mine would have the ability to
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
deliver relief to our neighbors our
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
friends our elders our young families
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
just trying to get started and keep them
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
community the Need For Change is
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
urgent the status quo is unsustainable
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
and unless we find Solutions swiftly the
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
prob the problem will only continue to
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
snowball as more and more local people
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
pick up
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
sticks and see their family homes
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
properties I want to take a moment to
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the concerns that some may
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
have regarding the potential costs
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
associated with implementing a homestead
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
exemption so there's no hiding from the
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
fact that when you reduce taxes for one
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
group under an exemption you're raising
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
it for someone
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
else and I would again just emphasize
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
the important fact that this is local
 
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.310 align:start position:0%
the important fact that this is local
option

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
legislation in Conway for example we
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
have the support of many many business
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
owners for this exemption because when
 
00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:40.039 align:start position:0%
they saw their business tax bill go down
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
and their tax bill on their home go up
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
they were scratching their heads just
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
like everyone else and they saw the
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
Injustice of it on its face so this is a
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
decision for each Community to make as
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
we seek to achieve a sustainable
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
community that balances the needs of
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
local folks
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
our tourist industry which we
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
value as well as other businesses in the
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
community but right now we simply lack
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
choices I also want to acknowledge that
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
there are going to be some local costs
 
00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:17.789 align:start position:0%
there are going to be some local costs
to

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
implementation among these costs are
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
likely software updates which I've heard
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
estimated in the ball park of maybe
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
$5,000 in Vendor
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
fees uh additionally there's likelihood
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
of Staffing costs to the municipality
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
associated with the additional time
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
needed for
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
administration but again I'd emphasize
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
that this legislation is strictly
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
enabling each Community has the autonomy
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
to decide for itself whether incurring
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
those additional costs is justified by
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
the benefits of providing meaningful tax
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
relief for local
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
residents lastly I want to acknowledge
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
that there are many many many different
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
ways to structure a homestead
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
exemption and as a prime sponsor of this
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
bill I don't pretend that my way is the
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
only way so I want to say Point Blank I
 
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.870 align:start position:0%
only way so I want to say Point Blank I
remain

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
flexible eager to work with anyone who
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
wants to help me find a solution for my
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
constituents and open to Amendment on
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
this bill I've already been working
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
closely with nhma over the last several
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
weeks to address uh technical concerns
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
that they have raised such as the need
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
to address pration more clearly in the
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill in cases of fractional ownership
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
and shifting our method of calculating
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
the cap on this exemption from using an
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
average to a median to control for
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
property value
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
outliers that that amendment is in
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
process and I'm happy to share it with
 
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.590 align:start position:0%
process and I'm happy to share it with
you

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
today I'm also eager to work with you
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
all in committee to resolve whatever
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
additional concerns you might raise
 
00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:58.039 align:start position:0%
today I urge this committee to consider
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
action on this issue this year and I'm
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
eager to collaborate with all committee
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
members and stakeholders as we work
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
together to find a solution that ensures
 
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
meaningful property tax relief for local
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
families for my community and for others
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
like mine it is Mission critical that we
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
prioritize the financial stability of
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
our residents especially our most
 
00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.190 align:start position:0%
our residents especially our most
vulnerable

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
residents and take proactive steps this
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
year toward a more fair and sustainable
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
tax system
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
consideration and I look forward to
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
working collaboratively with members of
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
committee to advance this
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for your testimony
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.870 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
representative

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
Gallagher so I believe we had um a
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
similar Homestead um property tax
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
exemption bill before us last term that
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
I believe it was representative Reed was
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor on uh I'm wondering if
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
um you're familiar with um her bill from
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
last ter at all and if so if you could
 
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
um compare um yours with hers at
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
all sure I I am somewhat familiar with
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
it um this legislation shares some
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
features with it and differs in other
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
ways I'll say that one um feature of
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
that legis ation was that it had a fair
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
Fairly elaborate system for means
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
testing I will say if means testing is
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
something this committee would want to
 
00:30:38.509 --> 00:30:38.519 align:start position:0%
pursue I'm open to discussing how to do
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
that in a way that isn't too
 
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
burdensome my feeling in drafting this
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
bill was that a homestead exemption is
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
already by Nature Progressive right
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
because your your greatest tax really
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
flows to your lower valued properties um
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
so in you you know one legislator's
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
opinion that additional um burden that
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
we would be be placing on administering
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
the exemption was not worth sort of the
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
tradeoff further questions represent
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
major thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um given given
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
the circumstances in Conway and I bet
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
this is similar in many other
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
communities how do you you envision the
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
definition of a
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
principal or or principally uh principal
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
residence by by some time that you live
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
there given that you have so many
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals sure
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
um in the bill it's there is a
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
definition of the term residence I think
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
to some
 
00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:54.110 align:start position:0%
to some
extent

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
um so the way we've defined it here is
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
which in which the person uh in good
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
faith regards his home to the exclusion
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
of any other places where the person may
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
temporarily live if you would advise
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we tighten that up I would
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
certainly be open to that
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion um it is nhma has also
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
suggested that we bring in a length of
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
residency requirement in line with the
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
elderly sort of parallel to what we do
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
for the elderly exemption I am very open
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
to that and I have put that into the
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
well representative Holland thank you
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question excuse me so is
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
it is it Revenue neutral in other words
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
the amount of exemptions that you give
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
to your community exactly theoretically
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
matches the increase that you're doing
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
to your short-term rental and then kind
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
of on that same note um I'm asking that
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
because could you take some of that
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
extra money and then utilize it because
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
it seems to be one of the cruxs of the
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
problems of of Conway is the decline in
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
value of your commercial uh properties
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's like Shifting the
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
burden more on the residential so while
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
you could give exemptions to tax relief
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
the other would be incentives to kind of
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
bolster your uh commercial core to kind
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
of balance your taxes out a little bit
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
better sure so I heard one question and
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
one idea I guess the answer the answer
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
to your question is yes it's Revenue
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
neutral and the my response to your idea
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
is I love that and I'd love to have that
 
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.710 align:start position:0%
is I love that and I'd love to have that
conversation

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you repres
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
br hello representative Paige uh I've
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
I've actually spoken to representative
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
Paige at length about this bill a number
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
of times and uh I'm very sympathetic to
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
what he's trying to do but I guess uh
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
for the committee a couple of questions
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
I had was what is a perspective like
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
representa Howland was talking about the
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
the view from the business owners and
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
and having to balance the tax rate
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
between them and the lower cost people
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
um what are the feelings and have you
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
review that specifically with them sure
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to speak for every
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
business owner I'm sure there's a
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's variable opinion and probably
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
your opinion somewhat depends on whether
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
you also live in town or not um I will
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
say that there is certainly a lot of
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
sentiment in the business community in
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
support of this effort I wouldn't
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
pretend that it's Universal uh but
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's certainly support we just had a
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
letter to the editor in the paper the
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
other day from a business owner um
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
saying how unjust it was when they got
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
these two bills and how it didn't make
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
any sense to them so I I wouldn't say
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's uniform but it's I don't think that
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
the business Community is going to come
 
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
out against this bill hard in our town
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
people need workers people's workers
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
need a place to live um so I think PE
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
people understand that people understand
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.069 align:start position:0%
 
large

00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
initial question Mr follow up uh in
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
regard to what you had said earlier kind
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
of along the same lines but U you
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh the rates for the the
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
lower cost homeowners like U mobile home
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
type people lower cost what have the
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
selectman's view been on this and in
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
that you said their rate went up 70% I
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
mean some of this could be handled just
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
on the rates for different types of
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
homes in the town couldn't they
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
since I have three or four of my select
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
board here with me I would defer to them
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
when they speak on that question thank
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
you see no more questions thank you very
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
much for your testim thank you thank you
 
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.750 align:start position:0%
much for your testim thank you thank you
Mr

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
chairman okay um as I was bruising
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
through the pin cards I note that uh six
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
of the remaining eight are all from
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
Conway and I suspected from the
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
beginning this might have something to
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
do with the Str issue that's been going
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
on up there so I'm going to ask you once
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
again um if you are going to speak and
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
you're from Conway if there's anything
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to what representative Paige
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
said please do but please let's not go
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
down a repetitive testimony so with that
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call
 
00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:16.589 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call
uh

00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
I am Bill Marvel from uh South Conway we
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
like to call it um I will just
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
corroborate what David said um on a
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
personal basis I come from a family that
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
tends to be
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
sedentary um for three and a half
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
centuries they were in one Village in
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
England and for eight Generations in a
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
corner of Sussex County Delaware and now
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
for five on davis hill in South
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
Conway um I live 600 yards from the
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
house where I was conceived and I sleep
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
in the same bedroom I was given when I
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
was 5 years old and I hope to be carried
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
out of that house feet
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
first the recent uh increase in taxes
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
for me although it wasn't as bad as for
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
many uh challenges that hope U taxes
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
have all always been a problem for those
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
of us of modest income uh and now it
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
grows more
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
impossible um at a recent meeting I had
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
the pain of watching a 37-year veteran
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
police officer now in his 80s uh who was
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
a mentor to us as children having a hard
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
time controlling his emotions as he
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
explained that he might not be able to
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
survive with the taxes he now has
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
therefore I hope that rather than
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
finding an excuse to uh put this off for
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
another session uh that you will find
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
some means to help carry it
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
through uh where it's so badly
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
needed thank you thank
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
you seeing no questions thank you for
 
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.510 align:start position:0%

Boston I was fortunate to be a
well-educated

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
well-educated
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
professional worked for the State of New
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 25 years in the North
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
Country um I am a I'm in my ninth year
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
as selectman in the town of Conway and
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
I've been a
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
longterm member of the Zoning Board of
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment and the current chairman of
 
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
that board um I first want to address a
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of clarification on the
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
reassessment in the town of Conway as
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
you know it's required every four years
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
the valuations of the town are supposed
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
to be properties between 90 and
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
120% and we try to strive for the 100%
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
currently the valuation of the entire
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
town is at
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
99% previous to this businesses
 
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
commercial properties were paying in the
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
120 range and residentials were as low
 
00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.630 align:start position:0%
120 range and residentials were as low
as

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
55% so part of the reassessment is to
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
equalize that and in the current
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
structure commercial properties did go
 
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.270 align:start position:0%
structure commercial properties did go
up

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
24% so there was some Equalization there
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
so commercial properties did not totally
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
get out out of their tax burden there's
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
always problems issues concerns business
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
owners citizens long-term residents with
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
any reassessment and we're going through
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
that process of sorting it all out right
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
now and hopefully doing it in an orderly
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
manner I want to speak a little bit
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
about my mother who was a long-term
 
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
resident of Carol County was a
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
professional nurse also was very active
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
in local POS politics last 25 years of
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
her life she moved to Bradenton Florida
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
she owned two homes there and she was
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
able to live comfortably because there
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
was a Homestead Act in place which
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
helped her tax burden I represent a lot
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
of constituents who like me are aging
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
and we wish to age in place we want to
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
stay in our homes and we need some
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
relief from tax burden we know about the
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
tax structure of the State of New
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's no higher level taxes
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
so we take it on the chin with property
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
tax in a place like Conway like other
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
towns I'm sure with aging populations as
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
you probably know Carol County's the
 
00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:35.079 align:start position:0%
oldest aging county in the state and
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
that we need tax relief from doing it
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
and this this bill would help people
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
again age in place and stay in their
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
homes for a longer period thank you and
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%

how do you know how much uh the
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%

business um the valuation in Conway is
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%

Holmes

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank the committee for
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today I've spent
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
most of my adult life as a property tax
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
professional 10 years as assessor in
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
Beverly Mass Meed my first house in
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
1981 uh moved to Conway in uh 1994
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
became their tax assessor for 23 years
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh during that time he became very
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
active in the assessor Association here
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire serving most of its
 
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
functions including one year as its
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
president I was appointed to as a
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
charter member to the assessing stand
 
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
ERS board by then Governor jeene Shaheen
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
and reappointed 3 years later by then
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
Governor Greg Benson I say all this so
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
let you know that I think I'm delivering
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
informed opinion on this issue I've done
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
over 15 to 20 revaluations in various
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
communities in Massachusetts and and New
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um my opinion is that this
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
is the single most important piece of
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
legislation for property tax relief to
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents that I've ever
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
seen in my opinion is superior to
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
broad-based taxes rooms and meals sear
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
charges or the Massachusetts style
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
proposition 2 and a
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
half um what Conway is there are
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
Regional forces at work that control
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
Conway's real estate market and other
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
tourist attractive towns in New
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Conway has no control or
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
its residents have no control over their
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
property values uh people uh for one of
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
a better word are coming up with bags of
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
money driving up prices in the since we
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
came out of the last Great Recession um
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
Realtors have told me that more out
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
ofate people are buying real estate than
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
local so locals are priced out of it and
 
00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
not only that but they're paying cash
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
many times asking price many times above
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
asking price when they get into bidding
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
wars and even professional couples in
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
Conway I think of one uh who emailed me
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
at one point with pre-approved for
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
$300,000 mortgage and could not buy a
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
home because out of state people are
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
paying cash so the buyer the seller
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to wait for inspections
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to wait for appraisals it's
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
like here a bag of money let's close
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
this has resulted in um revealing a law
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's also a feature in Pro in Conway's
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
property tax system in that they're
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
required to revalue every 5 years and
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
every five years there's a reset to
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
market value for all classes of property
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the real estate action on
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
the residential side including the
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
demand for short-term rentals uh has
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
driven up property values and Conway 75
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
to 100% over the last 10 years
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
residential I the commercials Walmart
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
not so much it's harder to double the
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
price of a Walmart I believe the the the
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
number uh was the average increase was
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
either 25 or 45% for res for commercial
 
00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:05.559 align:start position:0%
and 75% for residential mobile homes
 
00:46:05.559 --> 00:46:06.510 align:start position:0%
and 75% for residential mobile homes
going

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
100% I just want to point out five
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
properties to illustrate the issue these
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
are well-known National Commercial
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
chains Walmart's tax bill in 2022 was
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
271,000 in 2023 $182,000 a reduction of
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
$888,000 Home Depot was 99,000 reduced
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
to 146 a reduction of
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
$53,000 McDonald's was 32,000 reduced to
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
22,000 a reduction in
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
$10,000 Hampton in
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
153,000 down to 8666 minus $34,000 and
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
LLB 1177 92 down to
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
85132 and I believe these numbers are
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
correct I believe the assessor did a
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
pretty good job statistically I haven't
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
done a deep dive into the individual
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
sales but just those five commercial
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
properties represent $219,000 decrease
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
in commercial property taxes none of
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
which goes uncollected it gets shifted
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
to homeowners that's 218 families seeing
 
00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:06.559 align:start position:0%
a $1,000 increase and it's a heck of a
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
lot more than five commercial properties
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
in Conway so I'd like to thank the
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee once again I'd like them take
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
seriously this bill I'm available to
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
answer questions technical questions I
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
was assess for so many years and I was
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
the town manager for the last five
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
before I retired in 22 thank you thank
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing no questions thank you
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
misho thank you committee members for
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify today my name
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
is Jim misho and I'm the town assessor
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
for Hudson New Hampshire um I did have
 
00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:55.559 align:start position:0%
written testimony but I think I need to
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh modify it and um if there is an
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that's going to be made to
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I would ask for a second
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing um there's a lot of
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
details to administering the homestead
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
exemption uh Massachusetts has it uh a
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
number of states have them Massachusetts
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
has it up to 35% of a property value um
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
which is kind of similar to this
 
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
one um looking to the proposal itself uh
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
this's a section that deals with annual
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
adoption by the
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
municipality so the question is what if
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
the municipality forgets municipalities
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
do forget things what if they forget to
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
put on the ballot does the homestead
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
exemption go away I don't know what if
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
it fails on the second year does it
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
revert to the first Year's value or does
 
00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:41.559 align:start position:0%
it go away I don't
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
know um something about the um way tax
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
rates are calculated is optional
 
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
exemptions are not exported into the
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
county tax rate process so there's an
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
RSA that would need to be amended if
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
this came into play um and that's RSA
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
2-j colon 3 section 13 and basically it
 
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
ignores the Exempted value of your
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
optional exemptions so um so as to not
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
distort a county apportionment on a per
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
municipality basis so that's a technical
 
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
part um the amount of the homes that
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
exemption available shall be a fixed
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
dollar amount determined annually by the
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
municipality pursuant to uh 7227 a and
 
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
shall not exceed an amount equal to
 
00:49:31.549 --> 00:49:31.559 align:start position:0%
35% of the um assessed value of
 
00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
residential property in the community
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
35% of what so we vote in March before
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
the new tax year starts I think it
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
should be clarified to say it's 35% of
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
the prior years's meeting assessed value
 
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
right but in a revalue year you would
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
want to add language it says in example
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
of a full reevaluation you want it to be
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
35% of that reevaluation year
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
so in a non- revalue year you'd know in
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
March what your prior year was but in a
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
revalue year you won't know what your 35
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
up to 35% is until you get done with the
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
reval and you're scrambling to get the
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
ms1 in and it's September because you
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to have the value of the exemption
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
arrived at in some total for the whole
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
Community for all the exemptions prior
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
to going to setting the tax rate right
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
you have to put on the ms1 so there's
 
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
some um timing aspects to the
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
important um it states that it is
 
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.349 align:start position:0%
important um it states that it is
applicable

00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
to each Homestead so so if I'm married
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
is it my Homestead and my wife's
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
Homestead is it two homesteads per
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
property I don't know um is it just on
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
single family property itself not a
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
single family with an L is not a single
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
family property right that's it's two
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
units is it single family property mixed
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
use right so it's got some commercial
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
got some single family I don't know
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
there might be some clarification in the
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
bill that speaks to that but I'm much
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
more comfortable when it's when it's
 
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
really clear right because a community
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
needs to administer this the same
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and every community
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
that adopts this speaking to that this
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
passes into law it's local option what
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
communities will not adopt this every
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
Community will adopt this that do any
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
kind of um commercial industrial base
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
that has any kind of second home base
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
the tax shift that Conway's been
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
discussing that's been going on in every
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
reevaluation but it's been magnified
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
since the year 2020 in Hudson we did a
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
reevaluation last year we didn't have
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
the same kind of tax shift but we had a
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
significant tax shift from commercial
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
industrial property owners to
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
residential so I think one if you put
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
this in the law you just got to be
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
prepared for what's going to happen and
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
of course property tax taxes will
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
increase on those properties that don't
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
receive a homestead exemption second
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
home owners apartment buildings do
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings pass on costs to
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
their tenants would rents go up I don't
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
know um commercial industrial property
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
business owners um this town has the
 
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
homestead their taxes are this high does
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
that mean they go to another to another
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
Community does the business leave that
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
employs people that work in that
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
community so there's some policy issues
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
that really go beyond just one Community
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's really kind of a Statewide question
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
what kind of Homestead do you want um an
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
excellent source for Homestead
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
exemptions and what is done in other
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
states is the Lincoln Land Institute of
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
land policy in Cambridge um the
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
principal uh I won't say researcher the
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
principal person dealing with property
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
tax there is Ron Raco and he's the
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner former commissioner of the
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
Boston assessing Department he's an
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
excellent source if you're going to have
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
any kind of um work session on this or
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a study Commission
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
on this or something like that so
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's definitely resources that you
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
on implementation costs I think were
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
address briefly um certainly software
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
changes right to the the mass appraisal
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
system or to the tax collection system
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
um certainly Staffing they pointed to
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
that you know it's one thing to track
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
the residency of a thousand or so
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
veterans credits that I have in Hudson
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
and about three or 400 elderly exemption
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
disabled exemption blind exemption right
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
all have residency requirements it's
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
quite another to track thousands right
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
think Manchester thousands right it's
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
not just Conway a lot of communes are
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
going adopt this um in other states that
 
00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
have Homestead exemptions and I think of
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
Florida because they often contact us
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
they have entire divisions in their
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
County assessing off County Appraisal
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
offices that deal with policing
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
Homestead exemptions that were granted
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
in error human nature being what it is
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
people are going to apply for this
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
exemption even though they may not
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
qualify and the community may not have
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
the resources to um you know go to core
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
logic or go go to other databases to
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
determine is that person really a
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
resident so in other states they have a
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
clawback mechanism that enables the
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
state to go back on the person for the
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
years in which they got the homestead
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
for which they were not entitled we
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't have that in Hampshire for any
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
exemption or credit we have to find it
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
within the tax year once the new tax
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
year starts we don't have the ability to
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
back bill so it hasn't become really an
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
important issue right because we're just
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with exemptions and credits and
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
it's only a small percentage of
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
community gets that gets them it'll
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
become much larger when you have
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
homestead exemption something to
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
consider um that's the extent of my
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
testimony I would be interested in you
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
know looking at any amendments that come
 
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
in um it's it's a signif significant
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
issue I agree with Tom Holmes it is
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
probably the most important issue
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with property taxes that this
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
committee will address this year thank
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
Brown so uh Mr misho uh are you for or
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
against this bill I speak to the
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
administrative aspects of it so my Huds
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
and board of slackman have not taken any
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
position on the bill so I I'm here just
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
to what about the bill would make it
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to administer at the local
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
level what about the bill um is could

idea I think I need to see more details
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%

year U mostly on residential homes I'm
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
my question to you as an assessor is in
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
communities such as Lebanon or even con
 
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:10.839 align:start position:0%
or any community in New Hampshire that
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
has an outsize proportion of properties
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
that do not pay at the level of single
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
family homes how will those
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities pay their bills should
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
this become law it's Revenue
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
neutral can you it's Revenue neutral if
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
if we're going to increase the
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
rate and those that don't get the
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
homestead will now pay on that increase
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
rate they will pay more taxes those that
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
receed the homestead exemption will get
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
less taxes if I understand your question
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
follow Mr followup repres I'm sorry but
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
is that in this
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
bill that's the Practical implication of
 
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
working out the impact of any exemption
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you any further questions
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
before you um did you say you were going

helpful uh one question I have would it
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
be fair because I've heard
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
different stories
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
on Commercial versus
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
residential assessments up down whatever
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that on a
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide basis in general not 100% of
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
the cases in general that commercial
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
properties assessed value have risen at
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
a slower rate than residential yes thank

me today I I don't have nearly the uh as
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
impressive Bona feed days as my father
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
um but I did stumble into local Politics
 
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
as well I am the uh chairman of the
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
planning board in Conway and um the uh
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
issue at hand uh I don't want to repeat
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
what's been said already but as a public
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
official I get a lot of people asking me
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
what can be done what what's what's this
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
what are we doing at the Town level to
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
help with the housing issue and with the
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
citizens and um if you look at the New
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire zoning Atlas Conway has some
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the most permissive Zoning for
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
housing and for um long-term housing
 
00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
long-term rentals and we constantly are
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
trying to work at the planning board
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
level of how to keep people in town how
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
to keep people in houses how to make it
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
affordable to live in the valley um
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um with the short-term
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
rental situation it has become rather
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
unaffordable to live in the valley and
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
some relief for the citizens is is
 
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
needed and it's needed for the
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
businesses as well we rely far too much
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
on j1's to come to the area to staff the
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants and the ski mountains and
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
because our communities are empty our
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
houses are empty I live I was born and
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
raised in Conway I live in a
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
neighborhood where when I was in
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
elementary school that's where you went
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
to get a pillowcase full of candy I mean
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the houses were all full of families
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
and people and now the community I live
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
in is more than half short-term
 
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
rentals and it's disheartening and it's
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
frustrating and um it is completely
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
skewed the value of our homes and my tax
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill went up more than
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
25% and
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's just I I don't know what else that
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
we can do at the Town level to help and
 
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here because it just seemed like the
 
01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
next thing to do I I also represent
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
families I have five kids on Thursday
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
I'm driving my daughter to
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
UVM um having to pay more in taxes is
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
not helping with her tuition um I'm a
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
blue collar worker I had to take the day
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
off to come down here and do this I
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
think I probably am maybe the only Blue
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
Collar person in this room and it's not
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
easy for people like me to get down here
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
and testify to stuff like this but it's
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
what people like me need and my
 
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
community so I hope that uh you
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
seriously consider this and uh thank you

the time and effort to come down and and
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
speak uh one other thing I did make um
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
mean to mention representative Brown
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%

01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
neutral uh next we have Carl
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
Tibido no
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
is good morning uh C tibo Vice chairman
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
of col Board of selectman testifying in
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
favor um some of what I'm going to start
 
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
off with is a little repetitive but I'll
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
get to the point uh this bill provides
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
much needed tax relief to those who can
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
least afford the large tax bills uh due
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
to the recent economic conditions
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
property values and Associated taxes
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
have skyrocketed and people came here
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
from a away paid well over asking price
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
for all types of residential real estate
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
resulting in a shift in assessed value
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
that is unbelievable a manufactured home
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the park excuse me went from an
 
01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
average of 47,000 to 125 resulting in
 
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
tax bills doubling or tripling in the
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
meantime commercial property went up
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
only modestly resulting in a $90,000
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
saving to the local wall at uh this is
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
result is that it's now upside down and
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed desperately to
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
correct that um here's the new
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
information our full-time residents are
 
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
persons that are primarily working in
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
the tourist industry and tending retail
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
facilities uh that's what the town of
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
Conway and the surrounding area relies
 
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
on uh there are those lobbying against
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
this bill to say it'll be bad for
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
tourism and second home real estate
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
market and I believe believe that the
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
opposite is true passage of this bill
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
will help the tourist industry in the
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
long run by allowing people to stay in
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
their homes and be able to work and
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
maintain the continuity of the tourist
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
industry today we have hotels that are
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
unopened others operating at reduced
 
01:03:13.269 --> 01:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
capacity as well as restaurants that are
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
closed two days a week for the lack of
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
adequate staff it'll only get worse if
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
the working folks are taxed out of their
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
home and no one will be left to staff
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
hotels restaurants shops and the
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
property maintenance company that take
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
care of all of this our three bordering
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
states have homestead tax benefits and
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear to have discouraged
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
any economic activity in any of them and
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
in some cases it actually helps to
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
attract full-time residents who can
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate uh A Better Tax situation and
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
we need to have more of this to fill the
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
jobs that are currently going unfilled
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
for lack of people it's time to get this
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
done so the residents can afford to live
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%

and I thank you for your
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%

all week
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
folks um my name as we just established
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
is Paul delang I'm the deputy Town
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
manager for the town of Conway I've been
 
01:04:58.109 --> 01:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
employed by the town of Conway these
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
past 33 Seasons I've seen a lot of
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
change uh I haven't seen anything like
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
the change we've seen in the last three
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
years uh since the anomaly which you
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
probably refer to as the
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic um before I get started in the
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
points uh that I want to touch on that
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
we've heard others say um Katherine heck
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
asked me to apologize to the committee
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
she had to leave to give testimony
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
elsewhere as you know she is within hand
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association uh there are some
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
Representatives that probably know that
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association was opposed to
 
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
the bill in the past because of
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
technical issues and she would uh she
 
01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:35.799 align:start position:0%
said that she would reach out to the
 
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
members and speak to you directly um but
 
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
asked me to say that they are officially
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
neutral on this and they are looking
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
forward to the
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
amendment and um I believe that's all
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
she wanted to
 
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.029 align:start position:0%
she wanted to
convey

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
convey
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
um what I no is that we've heard from
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
two uh very experienced seasoned
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
assessors one from Hudson one from
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
Conway my good friend Tom Holmes who I
 
01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
worked with for many years and they both
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
agree that this is the single most
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
significant legislation that could
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
help people who live and work in their
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
communities again this is a local
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
option um we heard some questions about
 
01:06:16.319 --> 01:06:17.349 align:start position:0%
option um we heard some questions about
technical

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
technical
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
issues we believe those can be worked
 
01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
out in the amendment so we're looking
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
for you know the committee support to
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
keep that alive so we have the
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that work uh we've
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
heard that we have surrounding states
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
that do this so clearly this can be
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
accomplished if Vermont
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
Maine ver um Massachusetts and Rhode
 
01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
Island can do it so good New Hampshire
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you again for that I do want to
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
point out that this is not an Str Str
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
issue this is a second home issue now
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to disagree that strs
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
maybe were the the difference that
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
allowed some people to afford a second
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
home but this is an issue that we
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
believe was uh for two reasons one we
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
are a Resort destination Community
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
therefore we're desirable to be there
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
some folks decided it was time maybe
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
maybe it was the pandemic that was their
 
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
Catalyst but these are affluent folks
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
affluent enough that they can afford a
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
second home they're not necessarily Str
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
strs we heard chairman colbath of the
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
planning board say that there are empty
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that's true so they're not
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
being short-term rented these folks
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
bought a property because Boston is only
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
two hours from where they work right
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
they're working in places that afford
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
them higher rates of pay more fluent
 
01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
communities but this is where they want
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
to be and that's why they're there uh
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
not an Str issue it's a second home
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
issue and yes we have many homes that
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
are sitting uh
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.150 align:start position:0%
are sitting uh
vacant

01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
earlier while listening to Mr uh Holmes
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
give testimony I I I thought I was in
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
the wrong committee I thought this was a
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
committee for legislation to have
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
separate commercial and residential tax
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
rates which of course New Hampshire
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have nor are we suggesting so
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
this vehicle this is the vehicle that
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
helps folks who it's this is their
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
primary dwelling right this is the this
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
is the vehicle that helps
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
multigeneration families hang on to
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
their homes I also hope that bill Marvel
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
will be able to be carried feet first
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
home now Bill no
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
editorial um I hear in my capacity as a
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%

the the u12 Championships this year in
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%

01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
Farmers our free market economy means if
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
you have the money to pay for more you
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
can if you have the money to buy real
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
estate without financing you can if you
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
get winded that you're losing the bid on
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
this piece of property then you can
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
raise your money whereas the school
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
teacher could not because they were
 
01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:37.309 align:start position:0%
teacher could not because they were
seeking

01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
financing we ask you for your support we
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
ask you for the opportunity to work
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
through the technical issues the
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
administrative issues we believe the
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
time has come for this local option in
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%

the
question

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
question

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
Million worth of um
 
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
business and about
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
2.5 uh
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
billion in in uh
 
01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
residential um and the average
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
valuation um is about
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
350,000 uh dollars so that talks uh up
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the 35% would be
 
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.270 align:start position:0%
to the 35% would be
$140,000

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
$140,000
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
exemption um it seems like um most of
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
the property um
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
is the shifting is not actually to
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
business so much as it is to the other
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
$24,000 uh uh homes so I guess have you
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
run I guess my question is have you run
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
any numbers and and found where uh a
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
person a homeowner uh reaches that break
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
even point where they're going to be
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
caught uh actually paying more uh if if
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
Conway was to adopt this scheme than
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh than they are
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
now you know I'm not I'm not sure the
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
analysis or the approach is um how we
 
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
would approach it again as as I said
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
earlier New Hampshire's not a state
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
where we have separate commercial taxes
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
and property taxes so the consideration
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
of the distribution and the value of the
 
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
commercial to the residential is not
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
part part of the analysis the analysis
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
is if you're living and working in
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
Conway if this is your primary dwelling
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
can you for can you expect to get some
 
01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.510 align:start position:0%
can you for can you expect to get some
tax

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
relief as opposed
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
to uh the folks who invested had a
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
second or third home and who paid above
 
01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.709 align:start position:0%
second or third home and who paid above
market

01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
prices so it's a
 
01:12:17.239 --> 01:12:20.350 align:start position:0%
prices so it's a
redistribution

01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
of of capital now that redistribution as
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know is across the whole board it
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't go from this part of the
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
residential to that it goes across
 
01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
whatever the value is left the shift in
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
the values is all based on the market
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
had commercial been strong but that's
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
not what happened even if it didn't you
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
could make an argument that you would
 
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
still want to
 
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.910 align:start position:0%
still want to
afford

01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
afford
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
your your primary dwellings your
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
residence in any Community the ability
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
since they made the choice to live and
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
work in the North country where they
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the opportunities for as much
 
01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.030 align:start position:0%
don't have the opportunities for as much
disposable

01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
disposable
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
Capital so your analysis is not
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
something that was jine to the factors
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
that drove us to ask for this
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
bill does that make sense to you what
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm saying we don't
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
have questions only go one way here
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative Brown so um you're the
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
deputy Town manager correct yes sir okay
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
so um based on a little bit of what
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
representa said and I was thinking about
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
this and you touched on a little bit you
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out how you're going to
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
do this correct how would this work how
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
would this
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
um this homestead exemption work in your
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
town to give to give the relief it seems
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
like you haven't um developed a plan if
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
this was passed do you understand what
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
I'm saying well I don't is I said it
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's working in these other states
 
01:13:58.629 --> 01:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
we're working on the amendment we're
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
working with the municipal Association
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
which is uh for the first time not
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill and I'm certain that
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
we can uh address the issues from the
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
assessor from Hudson um that's where
 
01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.709 align:start position:0%
assessor from Hudson um that's where
we're

01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:14:13.719 --> 01:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
we're
at

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
we like everyone in New Hampshire is on
 
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
you know on deadlines and we're we're
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
working that if we move this to
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment then these are your questions
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
and we can come back if we can have
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
another working session then we can
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
questions one more followup then we need
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
to move on so just quickly so where
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
would you see the burden being shifted
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
what what areas because you talked about
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
commercial and residential and how the
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
need goes to lower income people where
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
would that be shifted so because the
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
whole tax has to be shifted to other
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
folks right so we've heard heard about
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
three three sectors the
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
Homesteader the non-homestead
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
residential and that which is
 
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
commercial so it's shifted from the
 
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
sectors you're welcome okay seeing no
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
more questions thank you for your
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
HB were we on HB 1034 so I'm going to
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%

01:15:52.199 --> 01:16:08.709 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%

helpful I'm going to go ahead and open
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%

veterans representative power Vice

I appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
introduce to you today House Bill
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
1154 for the record I am representative
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
Diane power I represent the towns of
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
Brookline m in Greenville in Hillsboro
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
County District 36 to begin I will
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
address the background of this bill this
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
bill was filed upon the request of the
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
office of the adant General State of New
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of military Affairs
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
and veteran
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
services this is a straightforward Bill
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
clarify the intent of the existing
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
statute the current statute has been
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
found to be confusing in its
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation as well as
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
application as a result both veterans
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
and M municipalities erroneously believe
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
that some veterans qualify for this
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
property tax exemption when in fact they
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
should not
 
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
qualify this ambiguity also carries the
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
risk of the exemption being mistakenly
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
granted moreover this leads to a
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
patchwork of
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
application across the state due to
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities interpreting and applying
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
this law
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
differently again the intent of this
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
bill is to more precisely
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
clarify eligibility
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
Criterion thus making it easier for both
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
veterans and municipalities to
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
understand the law as well as for the
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities to correctly and fairly
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
Grant this property tax exemption next I
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
so as you can see um in lines 4 through
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
7 there is language that is struck and
 
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
the following additions are are made
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
first in line 8 a reference to RSA 21
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
colon 50 replaces the above struck
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
language and this aligns this section of
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
the law with the new Hampshire's
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
statutory definition of a veteran second
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
languages added in lines 8
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
through2 that clarifies the eligibility
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
requirements that a veteran must own a
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
home that had been adapted through the
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
VA through this through e either the
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
approved specially special adapted
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
housing sah Grant or a special home home
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
adaption sha
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
Grant alternatively a veteran must in
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
order to qualify and be eligible they
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
must own a home that had been that has
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
been specially adapted and this home has
 
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
been acquired from the sale of a
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
previously owned home that had been
 
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
adapted by the s or sha Grant and third
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
language is added in lines 12 through
 
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
13 um specifying that a surviving spouse
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
shall no longer qualify for the prop
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
this property tax exemption if they
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
remarry and this provision is completely
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with qualifications for other
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
military state and federal benefits for
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
surviving spouses which veterans and
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
their spouses should be very familiar
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
with and lastly the um in line 14
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
officer is is struck due to the addition
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
of the reference to in to the definition
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
of a veteran in 21 colon 50 and back in
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
line eight so with that Mr chairman that
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
concludes my bill introduction I'm happy
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions but in perhaps
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time um more
 
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:23.639 align:start position:0%
technical specific questions might be
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
deferred to um those from
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
the from the VA who are here to testify
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
understood do we have any questions for
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative power representative
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.070 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
um in in line nine it says that um
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
someone who owns a home who who which
 
01:21:53.629 --> 01:21:53.639 align:start position:0%
has been specific specifically adapted
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
by the Veterans Administration um does
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
that mean that the Veterans
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
Administration has to be the contractor
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
or um like I I don't see how this um
 
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
like wouldn't it be better to say like
 
01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
it was um through through funds
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
approved uh through the uh these
 
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.870 align:start position:0%
approved uh through the uh these
programs

01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't that be more clear thank
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
you representative um that's a very good
 
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
question and I do agree that that
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
language is a little bit vague the
 
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
language was given to me um by the
 
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs and
 
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.229 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs and
veteran

01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
veteran
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
services and um I'm open to
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
clarification in an amendment if that is
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
needed and I would ask um I don't
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
believe that that the VA needs to do the
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
Contracting work but we could clean
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
clean that up in an amendment so you
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
might want to ask the others who are
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
here to testify after
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
me thank you representer
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
brown represent power I had a similar
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
question my my question is I support
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
numerous veterans organization including
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
tunnels to Towers which do these types
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
of things for for veterans so uh along
 
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
the same lines to say by the Veterans
 
01:23:19.229 --> 01:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
Administration or some other
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
organization that might be providing
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
these funds that would still meet the
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
criteria uh that's shown in this uh
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
document so I I really think we need to
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that so is is that something
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
that uh I guess other speakers will be
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
able to address or is that something
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we' have to have an amendment for
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the observation
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative so um my understanding is
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
that the special adapted housing or
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
special home adapt adaptation Grant is
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
obtained through the Veterans
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
Administration so um that's my comment
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
there speaks to the use of the word by
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
however I can't sitting here right now
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
answer your question I know that the
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill that is in front of you speaks
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
specifically to the S sh
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
grants so that would have to be a
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
conversation as to
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah are these technical questions going
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
forward or um like representative
 
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
suggested maybe we if they're technical
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions can they be given to one of
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
our upcoming or is it specific go ahead
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative Brown so this is just a
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
another piece of the language down in
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
line 16 I I happen to know several
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
people that are 100% disabled by the
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
veterans but they are unemployed and
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
this talks about unemploy employability
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
so is that something that can be
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
addressed a lot of these people have
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
mental health issues where they can work
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
but uh and so they're still employable
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
but they have 100% disability would this
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
count for
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that so thank you for the question
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative to be clear you you're
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to 100% permanently and
 
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
totally disabled we which does which
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
does indicate
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
unemployability that part of the text is
 
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
is not changed so it's not relative
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that's the proper
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
answer uh keep in mind represent all
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the table that only
 
01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
the Bold is the actual change is
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
anything else that's there is generally
 
01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
existing representative almost yes
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
represent thank you
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
um going to back to kind of the purpose
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
of this instead of the the wording that
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
you chose
 
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
um the goal of this legislation is not
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily to change the um people that
 
01:26:10.199 --> 01:26:11.149 align:start position:0%
necessarily to change the um people that
are

01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:26:11.159 --> 01:26:13.750 align:start position:0%
are
currently

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
um um qualifying but to make it um the
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
language more uh transparent to who does
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
and does not qualify is that your
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you representative
 
01:26:31.709 --> 01:26:31.719 align:start position:0%
that is that is correct the intent of
 
01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is to Simply clarify the
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
statute thank you further questions
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%

assessor for the town of Hudson uh I'm

neither for nor against this bill I just
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
point out some administrative aspects to
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
it and um just my understanding of how
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
the law currently reads versus um The
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
Proposal we have two of these in Hudson
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
two properties that are receiving the
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
100% exemption as a point of reference
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
according to dr's online data there's a
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
total of $25.6 million in Exempted value
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
currently under of this total exemption
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
RSA uh the dr's online data currently
 
01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't show the actual count of
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
residences Exempted by my recollection
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
is it is definitely less than a 100 in
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
state going to lines on the
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
bill let's see 12 through
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
13 the part that says the person or
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
person surviving spouse and then bold
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
who does not remarry that is um that's
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
addressed all already in RSA
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
72 um it says the term surviving spouse
 
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
shall not include a surviving spouse
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
that has remarried but if and this is
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
for all of 72 tax
 
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
credits um shall not include a surviving
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
spouse that is remarried but if the
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse is later divorced his
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
or her status as surviving spouse of a
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
veteran is
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
regained so that's the way the law
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
currently reads as it applies to this
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
exemption The Proposal is if they
 
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
remarry it doesn't matter if if they get
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
divorced they're not going to get it
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
back so that's a change from how it
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
currently is um the body of my written
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um goes to how the law is
 
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:04.630 align:start position:0%
testimony um goes to how the law is
currently

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
currently
[Music]

01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
written versus The Proposal that I'm
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're going to have folks
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
that are currently getting it that will
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
have their exemption
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
removed and I'm not sure if that was the
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
intention this really doesn't go to the
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
the part about clarifying this goes to
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
the definition under
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
2150 so it's very wordy in my written
 
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will get absolutely
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
tongue tied up here trying to address it
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
all because it's more of a give and take
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
discussion um and uh sometimes it's
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
better for a session other than a public
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm going to finish up my
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
testimony with that um I just I do have
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
concerns of folks that might be losing
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
this about the retroactivity of this um
 
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:51.639 align:start position:0%
and definitely with the definition what
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're he hearing is that communities are
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
not applying this correctly well if this
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
corrects it then there's going to be
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
people losing it I would imagine every
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
Community would have to revisit of those
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
you know relatively small number under
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
100 but they still have that
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility to revisit it so I'm not
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
saying that's a reason to be against
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
this I'm just saying something's to be
 
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
aware thank you thank
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
question um in line five um the current
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
law states that um if someone owns a
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
specially adapted Homestead which has
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
been acquired with the assistance of
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
veterans and
 
01:30:34.119 --> 01:30:36.030 align:start position:0%
veterans and
administration

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
um that seems very broad um as far as I
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
thought that um there is some loan
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
programs um and not necessarily just
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
these um special adapted housing and
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
special home adaption grants um
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
currently uh the assistance of Veterans
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
Administration is very Broad and any if
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
if someone used any money from the
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
Veterans Administration essentially to
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
purchase this home and and adapted it
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
themselves let's say that would
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
currently under the law be
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
um uh they would be eligible for this
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph but under the new
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh language it would have to be they
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
have to get this money specifically from
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
these Grant programs um do you see is
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
that the where some of your concern is
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
as far as like people not being um
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
eligible anymore that were previously
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
eligible thank you for the question
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
representative thank you my my con my
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
concern is that we're redefining what
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
veteran is for purposes of the
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
application of this statute we're taking
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
2150 and rep replacing how it's
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
currently administered and so there's
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
different classes of discharges that are
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
addressed in the body of my written
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
testimony so it's not the part about the
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
grant it's a part about the definition
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
of the veteran I actually think that the
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
language clarifying using those specific
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
words from the federal government from
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
the uh VA are helpful um we just went
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
through one of these and we we were
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
looking and did get copies of the
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
specially adapted Grant um document so
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
um we also benefit from um what's what I
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
call the Belmont decision which was a
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
decision that went up to Supreme Court
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
um that clarified um how the certain
 
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
disabled veteran exemption is to be
 
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:45.400 align:start position:0%
applied um and that's the most recent
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
and probably only most recent uh case
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
that further comments
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for your
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
test oh sorry representative Gilman
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I came in late thank you Mr chair
 
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
I have a question that may be answered
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the um uh handouts that we just
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
received um where did it go on line 11
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
it uh talks about a home that has
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
received the sah or sha Grant um owns
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
the home and especially adopted and has
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
been acquired using proceeds from the
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
sale of such a home would you interpret
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
that as someone who has an adapted home
 
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
sells it and the next person gets
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
exemption so someone that's not a
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
certain disabled veteran acquiring the
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
home no they would have to meet that
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
criteria if if a second disabled veteran
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
buys a home
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
home um that has been adapted using the
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
proceeds from one either the grant
 
01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.189 align:start position:0%
proceeds from one either the grant
program

01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
or I don't I don't see it that
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you thank you very much
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh the next individual and unless
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
there's anybody else in here who hasn't
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
signed a card I only have one more and
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%

services uh as stated by the prime
 
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor for the bill um we're hoping to
 
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
clarify the language for the eligibility
 
01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
ility for certain disabled veterans to
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
be exempt from property tax taxation on
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
a household that was adapted through a
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
Veterans Administration special adaptive

housing or special home adaptation Grant
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
or that was acquired through use of pro
 
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
proceeds from the sale of such a sah or
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
SHA home the department of military
 
01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services requested
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
this Legislative Assistant to clean up
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
the language in RSA 72 36a uh the rsa's
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
current language is not specific enough
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
to establish solit criteria for for
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
those who might qualify under this RSA
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
and in many cases has been too open to
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation by the assessors that
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
would be uh that would approve the 7236
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
alpha or by the veterans who seek tax
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
exemption under this RSA this language
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
removes doubt as to who qualifies for
 
01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
the exemption as it establishes that a
 
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
veteran must be so disabled that the VA
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
has deemed them 100% permanently totally
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
and determined that they further qualify
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
for extensive home ad adaptations
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%

disabilities they have to be service
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
connected disabilities in in order to
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for the va's sah or sh Grant uh
 
01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:32.840 align:start position:0%

individual can't balance or walk without
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%

respiratory or breathing injuries and
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
before I actually conclude my test
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
I I want to kind of bring up a couple
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
examples of the reason why I brought
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
this forward or asked to have this
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
language clarify I've had veterans
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
believe me when I get when it comes to
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
veteran tax CR credits I get all the
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
questions and when they contact me I got
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who interpret laws
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
differently and the way the law is
 
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
currently written I've got individual
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
who will call me up and they'll say well
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'm 100% permanent total and I got my
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
home through a VA home loan so I qualify
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
for an exemption well there's already a
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
property tax credit for somebody who's
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
permanently totally disabled that's up
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
to a $4,000 tax credit so I have to
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
explain to them you think the threshold
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
between a $44,000 tax credit is a and a
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
complete exemption is the approval of a
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
VA home loan which is obviously I don't
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
believe the intent of this law when it
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
was written was for it was for veterans
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
who not only permanently totally
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
disabled but they're so disabled that
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
they require special adaptations to
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
their home which the VA pays for in a
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
special housing adaptation or special
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
adaptive housing Grant additionally I
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
had a veteran call me up and said well I
 
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
have a I have a adapted my home I paid
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
for a $10,000 walk-in tub so I should
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for this grant I said did you
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
get that money from the VA no I did it
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
myself I said well that's a great
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
investment that you made a 10,000 tub
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
for tax exemption for the rest of your
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
life so You' have I I told the veteran
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
my suggestion was to go back to the VA
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
and ask for special adaptive housing or
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
sah grant for that home a couple
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
questions were asked here about
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
permanent total and
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
unemployability so permanent total it's
 
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
important to understand that a per
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
perent total disability does not
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
automatically mean that the veteran is
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
on crutches or they're in a wheelchair I
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
am 90% service connected many people
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
look at me would have no idea that I'm
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
90% service connected and I'm currently
 
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
in the process to get my evaluation
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
raised to 100% permanent total so 100%
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
permanent total does not mean the
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
veteran cannot walk cannot do things
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
does not mean they're unemployable 100%
 
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
permanent total just means that the
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
totality of their disabilities the VA
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
believes are permanent and will never
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
change so that's why they rate them the
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
100% permanent total in addition
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
unemployability is not something the VA
 
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
grants it's something that a veteran
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
applies for and has to be approved by
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
the VA so the VA just doesn't really
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
nearly Grant people unemployability it's
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
veterans who have disabilities that are
 
01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
so severe that they request from the VA
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
unemployability because they can no
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
longer work they're telling the VA they
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
can no longer work so that's really the
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
difference between a permanent total and
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
an unemployability you can be 100%
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
permanent total and not be
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
unemployable right or you can be both
 
01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
you can be permanent total and the VA
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
considers you
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
unemployable so I just want to make
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
those distinctions and I open myself up
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
for any
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you for your
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
question um so kind of going back to my
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
previous question um the it seems like
 
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
their concern was about the definition
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
of veteran and your concern more is
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
about the um the vagueness of acquired
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
with the assistance of veterans uh
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
Administration kind of like I alluded to
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
earlier um do you see any concern about
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
the change in the definition of
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
veteran well I I I don't believe this
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
does change the definition of veteran
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
again this specifically is looking or
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
should not be changing the definition of
 
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
veteran uh it should be looking to
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
stipulate that in order to qualify for
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
this tax exemption you not only have to
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
be 100% permanent total but you also
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
have to have an approved sah or sha
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
grant that literally is the basis for
 
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking for in this is just to
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
make that so that nobody's asking that
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
question well you know I have this going
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
on or somebody asked if I had it my
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
house adapted for me through May through
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
another another organization that did it
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's not the same thing as a SE that
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
other organization May adapt your home
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
for you but maybe not because you have a
 
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
service connected disability you have a
 
01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.639 align:start position:0%
disability right so not all disabilities
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
that veterans have or service related
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
this specifically is
 
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
service these these grants or for
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
specific service connected
 
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities represent Mill thank you Mr
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question I
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
heard you mention a date um like
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
September 11th
 
01:41:52.589 --> 01:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
so I just you needed some clarification
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
you can only qualify for this particular
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
thing if your service connected injury
 
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
happened after September 11th and you
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
qualify for these grants so that's so
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's VA because that's all that stuff
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
down there is all that part of it is VA
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
criteria so they do have spe specific
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
criteria for and that's only in this
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
specific area right so the loss or loss
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
of use of one low one lower extremity
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
Fort Lake after September 11 2001 so
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's the VA stipulation I don't know
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
why the VA stipulated
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah I will tell you that the VA
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
does have a a 2001 September 11 2001
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
stipulation for a lot of their rules I
 
01:42:35.229 --> 01:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
don't know why they have
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not the
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
VA thank you further
 
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
questions just one really really really
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
quick one um is is it my understanding
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
or that your intention for this language
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
change is merely to clarify it doesn't
 
01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
change who qualifies who doesn't qualify
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
strictly to
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
clarify that that is correct it it it
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
literally that's does not change
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility it just helps clarify the
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
language U and as the the assessor Mr
 
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
mad mentioned there might be some people
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
that will absolutely potentially lose
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
out on their tax exemption if the town
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
assessed or looked at it or did not
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
understand or did not the the the
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
interpretations were were different so
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
there might be people that lose out on
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
this benefit okay thank you represent
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
David so therefore it would hinge on
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
qualific on
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility it's not simply a language
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
change it's a substantive
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
change is that a question that's that's
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
a question for the gentleman
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
testify in your opinion does that
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
language even though it might affect
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility for some veterans already
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
receiving this credit is it just
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
clarifying language even though that
 
01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:57.270 align:start position:0%
clarifying language even though that
might

01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
happen I'm yes I believe it is right so
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
I are there people out there that may
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
have gotten this benefit and maybe
 
01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
weren't authorized it or shouldn't have
 
01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
gotten it because they lawyered the law
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
sure I I believe that those individuals
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
if it didn't apply if if they
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
used their own their own own
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
interpretation to try to get a benefit
 
01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:24.679 align:start position:0%
that they didn't wasn't wasn't really
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
designed for
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
them again at the end of the day for me
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
it's about intent of the law and it's
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
hard to read intent in the language but
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
I believe the intent was to say if you
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
are a veteran who is so disabled and
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
you're permanently total and you're so
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
disabled that you require assistance
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
through the VA to to live in your own
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
home I believe those are the individuals
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
that this was designed for there are
 
01:44:50.109 --> 01:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
obviously those individuals who have
 
01:44:50.119 --> 01:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
obviously those individuals who have
used

01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
their own language their own
 
01:44:54.669 --> 01:44:54.679 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law and maybe an
 
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
assessor didn't push back or they were
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
granted it uh it definitely wasn't to me
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
designed for somebody who's 100%
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
permanent total and qualifies for a VA
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
example okay seeing no questions thank
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%

people I'm sorry I didn't see it no you
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%

bills the chairman of this committee has
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
once again failed greatly to estimate
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
the timing on some of these bills I
 
01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:15.639 align:start position:0%

Mr
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
chairman as a member of the committee
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
this this last bill and a couple of the
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
other bills that we're hearing
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
today there's a real possibility that I
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
could benefit from those personally
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
what restriction do I have in
 
01:47:31.229 --> 01:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
participating and voting since I it's a
 
01:47:32.669 --> 01:47:32.679 align:start position:0%
very real
 
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
possibility uh that I could
 
01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
benefit uh is there a restriction as far
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
as participating in this I don't believe
 
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
there's any part uh restrictions on
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
participating here once we get into it
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
maybe the exact session or on the house
 
01:47:49.149 --> 01:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
floor possibility um I'll have to look
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
specifics of that because I'm not I know
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
you do have the ability to sign an
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
Ethics related document that says you
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
know I am or am not going to vote on
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
this because but uh I don't know this
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
not an expert on
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
that but right here in the hearing you
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%

open up the hearing on HB 1055 I not
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%

01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
bill came to my attention uh last
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
beginning of last year I guess it was I
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if your community we have
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
small school houses that have been
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
around for like a 150 years or churches
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
that just sit out on the side of the
 
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
road on a field they have no power no
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
running water they're just things that
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
part of our community that we've had for
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
so many years uh a couple of the the
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
churches ran into some problems trying
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
to get their documents all together to
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
prove that they were
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and this will address this
 
01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.750 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and this will address this
issue

01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh gives them some extra opportunity to
 
01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
get to try to get the Dos together so
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
they can get the
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh the waiver on the taxes um I spoke
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
and worked with the municipal
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
Association and also worked with uh my
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
town assessor um who's also here
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully and if you could direct your
 
01:49:46.589 --> 01:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
questions at him as far as how it's
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
going to affect your your community
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman uh my name is

Todd members of the committee my name's
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
Todd Haywood I am a contract assessor I
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
have 10 communities that I do assessing
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
for and wolfboro happens to be one of
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
them and it this bill seems to be more
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
of a housekeeping item where you're
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
afford a similar um flexibility to the
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities to accept uh late
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
documentation and still Grant the
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
exemption for some of these charities in
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
particular um where the way it stands
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
now is if the Charities don't submit
 
01:50:37.679 --> 01:50:38.430 align:start position:0%
now is if the Charities don't submit
their

01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
financials by before June 1st if it's
 
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
received on June 1st they shall be
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
denied the exemption we we were hoping
 
01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
that we could have flexibility to accept
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
those necessary paperwork later but
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
before the setting of the tax rate so
 
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
this is in my opinion a housekeeping
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
issue and um and I think that's it and
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
and can I add on 7223 c yeah you like to
 
01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
so so representative McDonald did speak
 
01:51:15.629 --> 01:51:15.639 align:start position:0%
about 7223 C which Roman numeral 2 which
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
um allows the assessors selectman to
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
request documentation such as the
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
Articles of Incorporation or certificate
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
of good standing or anything else we
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
think is is relevant to granting the
 
01:51:31.950 --> 01:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
exemption right now it says if you if
 
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
you're requested you shall respond
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
within 30 days or you shall be denied
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that we can have some
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility on that regard as well what
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
happened in one of my communities
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
was we requested the
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
information we got the the information
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
received the information but it wasn't
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
within 30 days so we had to assess them
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
a year's taxes for these churches and
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
Charities and we're just we're just
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
hoping that the legislature will see fit
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
to allow some flexibility by the
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
selectman or whomever the local
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
is representative
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I've been out of
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit business for about 15
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
years but isn't it form 990
 
01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
informational filing that is due uh to
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
the IRS by these
 
01:52:38.069 --> 01:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
Charities so that that is a requirement
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
by the IRS but it doesn't have to be a
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
form 990 that's provided to the
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
municipality similar information is what
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking for but it doesn't have to
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
be the 990 if I could follow up do you
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
know when the form 990 is due well it's
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
due in November at the latest which is
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
past our tax rate setting got it thank
 
01:53:02.669 --> 01:53:02.679 align:start position:0%
you representative Elward small
 
01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
technical issue when you request a
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
followup requests through the chair
 
01:53:13.149 --> 01:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
please not a big deal thank you uh
 
01:53:13.159 --> 01:53:14.310 align:start position:0%
please not a big deal thank you uh
representative

01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
stav thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um planning board
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
parlament the phras is mistake or
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
Misfortune which is mentioned in line
 
01:53:31.870 --> 01:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
nine of the bill is um conflated to the
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
words um good
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
cause uh which has legal standing that
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
phrase does and I'm wondering
 
01:53:43.069 --> 01:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
if I wondered if you had considered
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.669 --> 01:53:50.679 align:start position:0%
Misfortune either either doesn't matter
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned as long as
 
01:53:55.149 --> 01:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
there's some flexibility but you bring
 
01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
up a good point accident mistake or
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
Misfortune isn't defined and it would be
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
helpful if it were for someone like me
 
01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if it were defined
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
because you could as you've heard
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
earlier you could you could interpret
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
anything any way you like if it behooves
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
you represent representative
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
yala thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:54:17.159 --> 01:54:18.669 align:start position:0%
yala thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
um there are a bunch of
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
exemptions um that need to be requested
 
01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:30.830 align:start position:0%
exemptions um that need to be requested
annually

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
um does any other
 
01:54:37.629 --> 01:54:37.639 align:start position:0%
exemptions um that you're aware
 
01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
of allow for this
 
01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility um by the
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
select board or the governing body to uh
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh wave those deadlines so the per the
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
personal exemptions are permanent which
 
01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
your veterans elderly Etc and those are
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
um those do allow for accident mistake
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
or Misfortune which is inde defined but
 
01:55:07.069 --> 01:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
you can take it
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
later the the institutional exemptions
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
is what we're we're talking about the
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
Charities the schools and the churches
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
are annual so they have to apply every
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
year and
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
their application allows it's in the law
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
that allows for them to be uh if there's
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
an accident mistake or Misfortune to
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
prevented them from filing timely the
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
selectman can accept it but it doesn't
 
01:55:34.350 --> 01:55:34.360 align:start position:0%
allow for the financials to be accepted
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
late and that's that's what we're that's
 
01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
what we're hoping for so we're actually
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
looking to bring this into the
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
continuity of all the other exemption
 
01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
laws at least that's how I see it
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
anyways thank
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman so as I look
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
at the the Bold language which is the
 
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
amended language to be included I notice
 
01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
on lines nine and 10 it says may
 
01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.910 align:start position:0%
on lines nine and 10 it says may
receive

01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
so that leaves the option up to the
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
officials to either receive the
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
information or not to receive the
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
information was that the intent here
 
01:56:22.069 --> 01:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
it's still up to the discretion I think
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
so I think the discretion is what we're
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
looking for for the
 
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
municipality and you could correct me if
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.589 --> 01:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
agree further
 
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
questions I have one question
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the accident mistake
 
01:56:42.669 --> 01:56:42.679 align:start position:0%
Misfortune language um at what point
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
what is the earliest date that a
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit could
 
01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
file um their exemption request
 
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
the day after the tax bill is issued it
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
it the filing period is the final notice
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
of tax until April 15 but you have to
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.079 --> 01:57:10.750 align:start position:0%

for exactly the same reason but in a
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%

L thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Alyssa margolin and I'm here
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
today speaking on behalf of the New
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Center for nonprofits we're
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
the Statewide Association um that
 
01:59:52.109 --> 01:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
supports the nonprofit sector in New
 
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you know um the pandemic
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
taught us how integral nonprofits are in
 
02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire communities um and
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
many ways New Hampshire is a little
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
different than other states our
 
02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector is often providing
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
essential Services where government and
 
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
other states would be providing that we
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
have many nonprofits in New Hampshire um
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
often the number of them is
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
misunderstood because so many uh out of
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
state nonprofit are required to register
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
in order to fundraise here we have about
 
02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
7,000 nonprofits they actually make up
 
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
onethird of New Hampshire's Workforce
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
and generate billions to the economy but
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
as you know in your communities
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are often very small and lack
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
administrative support most many grants
 
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
and government grants and philanthropy
 
02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of overhead and limit
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of administrative support So
 
02:00:49.229 --> 02:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
deadlines mistakes misfortunes accidents
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
do happen um and we appreciate the um
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor's intent to enable
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities to allow for a little
 
02:00:59.709 --> 02:00:59.719 align:start position:0%
flexibility in those cases um when a
 
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit is uh owning a property and
 
02:01:06.189 --> 02:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
using it for Mission related purposes
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
they benefit from a property tax
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
exemption and have to file this annual
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
filing um so that we hope that the
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
committee will consider uh enabling
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities to partner with these
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
essential nonprofits in their community
 
02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:20.189 align:start position:0%
essential nonprofits in their community
thank

02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
you questions from the committee see
 
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
testimony uh
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
misho thank you Mr chair Jim misho Chief
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
assessor in Hudson New Hampshire um I am
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill I I believe that
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
um this I know that this language was
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
lifted from RSA 72 colon 33 i- a so this
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
language mirrors the accident mistake
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
Misfortune part that is available for
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
those personal exemptions and personal
 
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
credits um so this gives the Selectmen
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
that Authority that they don't currently
 
02:02:14.069 --> 02:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
have if it comes in June second and it's
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
not postmarked too bad so sad um and I
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's that's the
 
02:02:20.189 --> 02:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
proper way to deal with with this
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
exemption um we are though I think in
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
need of having a definition of what
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
accident mistakes Misfortune is and we
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't have that in law currently but we
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
do have it in rule um Dr administrative
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
rules rev 12
 
02:02:38.589 --> 02:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
01.01 defines it but that's only in
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
regards to low and moderate the btla
 
02:02:42.910 --> 02:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
also has administrative rule that
 
02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
defines that but it's not in relation to
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
the statute so I'd like to pass this
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
definition over to repres representative
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
from Lichfield and um I think it would
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for the local Selectmen
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
when presented with this what is an
 
02:02:58.750 --> 02:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
accident mistake Misfortune we have a
 
02:03:00.270 --> 02:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
definition I don't know if we have case
 
02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
law and that's the extent of my
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
testimony very good thank you that' be
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%

for the record my name is uh
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Moffett I represent
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
marac District 4 the lovely towns of
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
Canterbury and Lowden uh the simple
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
intent of this measure is to provide
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
enabling enabling legislation to
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:05:49.270 align:start position:0%
enabling enabling legislation to
municipalities

02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
so that if if locally there is is
 
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
sentiment to exercise the uh the totally
 
02:05:59.709 --> 02:05:59.719 align:start position:0%
disabled veteran tax option then uh said
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
municipality could offer uh a tax credit
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
of up to 100% of the local property tax
 
02:06:09.629 --> 02:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
uh again this is enabling it would be up
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
to the locality up to the
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
municipality um currently
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
RSA uh and you see the number there uh
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
72 colon 27 uh does allow for a tax
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
break of up to
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
$4,000 that's what's currently in
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
statute what this would do would be to
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
increase that from $44,000 to
 
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
100% uh again at the discretion of the
 
02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
100% uh again at the discretion of the
uh

02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
municipality uh now the total disability
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
would have to be service related and I
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
know there's some complicated
 
02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:50.679 align:start position:0%
potentially complicated definitions in
 
02:06:54.189 --> 02:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
terms of uh what constitutes
 
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
100% uh of a
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
disability but the again the intent here
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh if you can just imagine or or think
 
02:07:06.189 --> 02:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
of uh Springfield I guess there is a
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
Springfield but
 
02:07:13.069 --> 02:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
um uh any Town New Hampshire uh John
 
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
Smith is a veteran uh who was uh
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
grievously injured in in combat 100%
 
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
disabled so he lives in any any town and
 
02:07:27.149 --> 02:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
he and his wife or whatever uh his
 
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances are such that he has an
 
02:07:31.149 --> 02:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
$88,000 tax
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh he could get under current
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
statute $4,000 in relief uh but he has
 
02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
an $88,000 bill and his circumstances
 
02:07:45.549 --> 02:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
are set that he can't pay the property
 
02:07:47.549 --> 02:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
taxes so he would need to move or sell
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
his sell his house and the the good
 
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
folks in any Town New Hampshire don't
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
want to see John have to give up his
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
home or leave so that's the intent of
 
02:07:59.470 --> 02:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
this he would uh John Smith would be
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
able to uh request or petition or or
 
02:08:05.229 --> 02:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
someone could ask for him for for up to
 
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
the 100% option and if the if his n his
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh fellow uh any Town residents wanted
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
to offer that to him then they could if
 
02:08:19.629 --> 02:08:19.639 align:start position:0%
this were to move forward so that's the
 
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh the long and the short of it again
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation with uh local
 
02:08:28.549 --> 02:08:28.559 align:start position:0%
control over its use or employment or or
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
not and that is what I have and I'd be
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
happy to try to take any questions if
 
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.589 --> 02:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
any does anybody have any
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%

regards to this I don't see why you
 
02:09:10.589 --> 02:09:10.599 align:start position:0%
can't it's not being changed doesn't
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
mean you can no don't want to okay it's
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
fine I'm not sure what the question was
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like it it was answered
 
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:09:22.549 --> 02:09:22.559 align:start position:0%
she's retracting her question any other
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I just have
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
one uh represent mofit um do you know
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
approximately with this change how many
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire would
 
02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for this roughly uh that's a
 
02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
good question Mr chair and I I don't
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a I do not even have a ballpark
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
figure uh there are some folks here from
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
U esvac uh State veterans advisory
 
02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
committee who who uh very well may have
 
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
some information in the area but I I
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
could I would not venture to guess at
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
this time I am getting a nod from
 
02:09:57.069 --> 02:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
somebody in the back of the room saying
 
02:09:58.950 --> 02:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
he has that
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
um so I will wait to hear from that
 
02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
individual any further questions
 
02:10:04.199 --> 02:10:06.709 align:start position:0%
individual any further questions
represent

02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:09.639 align:start position:0%
power thank you for taking my question
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
so I was just curious why this um bill
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a fiscal note because
 
02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a fiscal note because
fiscal

02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:10:20.189 --> 02:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
notes other fiscal notes that I've seen
 
02:10:23.870 --> 02:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
um speak to State County and town I'm
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
just wondering why we don't have that
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
note well a lot of uh thank you
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
represent of power for the question uh I
 
02:10:33.149 --> 02:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
I see FN notes all the time on measures
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
you notti this says local so I I think
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
the FNS that that the folks here in
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
conquer uh research have to do with with
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
State monies and this would be local U
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
so the estimate of uh potential cost
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
locally uh goes to I think to the the
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair the chair's question about how
 
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
many folks there are out there who may
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
benefit from this around the state which
 
02:11:01.390 --> 02:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of but you didn't the case
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
somebody behind me was giving you some
 
02:11:08.189 --> 02:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh some good vibes on that so
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh if does that kind of answer your
 
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
question representative I it's a local
 
02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
FN thank you further questions
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative y
 
02:11:22.589 --> 02:11:22.599 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
when someone puts um something on the
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
warrant article or trying to pass this
 
02:11:40.750 --> 02:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
um they have to indicate the tax impact
 
02:11:43.229 --> 02:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
of of the
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
measure and um they can do that with a
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
specific dollar amount however with
 
02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
100% there's no known amount that the uh
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
that the voters would be
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
granting uh a waiver for um have you
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
thought about that um issue as far as um
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
how um to explain that to the voters
 
02:12:19.629 --> 02:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
essentially of how much money that
 
02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
they're shifting from one person's
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
pocket to another's sure thank you rep y
 
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's a great question uh in terms of
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
Warren articles uh if a municipality if
 
02:12:35.549 --> 02:12:35.559 align:start position:0%
someone in a municipality get the
 
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
requisite uh signatures to get a Warren
 
02:12:41.549 --> 02:12:41.559 align:start position:0%
article placed then they would they
 
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
could word it in different ways they
 
02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
could uh have a a figure of in the
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
Warren article of making this tax
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
benefit available uh for an amount up to
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
x amount of dollars uh because I I think
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
I get your point it without that uh it
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
could be an open-ended uh unfunded
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
Mandate of sorts if I'm if I'm tracking
 
02:13:10.830 --> 02:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
you so were this to be go to a uh Warren
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
article the Crafters or the writers of
 
02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
the article would have to uh decide if
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
they wanted to
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
make this available to like I said up up
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
to a certain point that's how I would
 
02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
answer that in terms of applying this to
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
article represent P thank you Mr
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:13:41.229 --> 02:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
um to the the point that the member just
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
made with regards to you have a fix fix
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
dollar amount on the low end and then it
 
02:13:53.709 --> 02:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
says up to 100% of the property tax well
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
clearly different individuals have
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
different tax bills sure so um it's not
 
02:14:02.830 --> 02:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
clear to me how something like this
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
administered yeah thank you for the for
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
the question and again I I kind of
 
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
touched on this and that's a very good
 
02:14:14.669 --> 02:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
question um this goes back to this being
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation so a town to if
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
someone in a town wanted to submit a
 
02:14:23.950 --> 02:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
warrant article with the requisite
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
signatures to uh create this
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
benefit uh presumably within the town
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
they would have done some some local
 
02:14:37.149 --> 02:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
Homer every Town's different uh some
 
02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:40.559 align:start position:0%
towns uh may have no one that would
 
02:14:43.149 --> 02:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
qualify and some Town larger towns may
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
have several so to try to answer that
 
02:14:49.229 --> 02:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
question that it would depend on the
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
municipality um and doing some local
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
research and homework in terms of how
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
many dis how many 100% disabled veterans
 
02:15:02.830 --> 02:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
live in any Town New Hampshire uh and if
 
02:15:05.310 --> 02:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
and and that is information that could
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
researched and if there are none then
 
02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
there are none or if there are
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
potentially uh 10 or 12 then you know
 
02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
those numbers could be extrapolated as
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
to the potential liability if the town
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
available representative Guthrie yes if
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
I can I think you're correct that that
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
that number can be extrapolated uh and
 
02:15:41.229 --> 02:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
you come up with the number very easily
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know how much you're paying the
 
02:15:47.629 --> 02:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
veterans benefit at the present time and
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
you you take
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
100% uh it's just a mathematical thing
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
but I also if I could uh suggest to you
 
02:15:58.589 --> 02:15:58.599 align:start position:0%
that the article doesn't have have to
 
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
have any money in it the article could
 
02:16:04.510 --> 02:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
should just be clearcut and say 10 say
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
100% there's no need to put the money in
 
02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
there you might have a inquiry as to
 
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
what it is but I suggest that the that
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
it is a it would be a an article with no
 
02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:19.629 align:start position:0%
it is a it would be a an article with no
funds

02:16:19.629 --> 02:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
attached thank you gu sure I think every
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
Town's different and we're a town to a
 
02:16:29.069 --> 02:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
town now can can try to put this in for
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
the benefit of up to 4,000 if if they
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to put an article in you I think
 
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
you're correct they they don't have to U
 
02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
specifically list the potential
 
02:16:41.469 --> 02:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
liability they they could uh again that
 
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
goes back to the local uh uh submitters
 
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
of a potential warrant article but uh
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
sure I
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
the real question is whether or not real
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not it would pass
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments and you have
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
you and further questions representative
 
02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
yella then
 
02:17:08.669 --> 02:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um for taking
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
another question
 
02:17:13.469 --> 02:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
um it seems
 
02:17:13.479 --> 02:17:15.270 align:start position:0%
um it seems
like

02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
$71 um and why not just essentially
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate any guidance from the state as
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
far as what um the tax amount could be
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
what what is your
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
um Logic for for that thank you for the
 
02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
question representative the the $71
 
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
figure is already in statute uh how that
 
02:17:50.669 --> 02:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
was placed there or when that was placed
 
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
there I I couldn't tell you but that's
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
what's there now uh the current statute
 
02:17:58.110 --> 02:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh makes this benefit available uh for
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
taxes from 701 up to 4,000 so the 7001
 
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
figure is there I'm not sure how that
 
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
originally uh became law but that is is
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
what's law now I I couldn't tell you
 
02:18:15.070 --> 02:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
exactly how or when that uh OS probably
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
could but uh where the 701 came from I
 
02:18:21.389 --> 02:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
exactly repr BR thanks for taking my
 
02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:26.110 align:start position:0%
exactly repr BR thanks for taking my
question

02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
so we've heard a lot of other testimony
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
today on other bills that basically
 
02:18:34.349 --> 02:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
relate directly to the person's primary
 
02:18:36.669 --> 02:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
resid I don't see anything in regard to
 
02:18:36.679 --> 02:18:37.709 align:start position:0%
resid I don't see anything in regard to
that

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
here thank you uh represent Brown so
 
02:18:42.509 --> 02:18:42.519 align:start position:0%
your question has to do with primary
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
residents as opposed to uh a second home
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
is that well basically basically any
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
other home or any other property I mean
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
I would think what we're looking at here
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
is trying to make sure that a disabled
 
02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:55.190 align:start position:0%
is trying to make sure that a disabled
veteran

02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
veteran
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
has the ability to not pay taxes on his
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
residents yeah thank you represent good
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
question that's why we have these
 
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
hearings so if if any town uh is on Lake
 
02:19:09.790 --> 02:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
wiip and the in the home that uh
 
02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
that John Smith the disabled veteran has
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
is on uh Lake winaki and it's a very
 
02:19:19.709 --> 02:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
expensive of home that's kind of maybe
 
02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
the your thought process would would set
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
a place it be uh would it be appropriate
 
02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
for such a situation for the veteran to
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
be able to get this 100% benefit which
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
if any town was in a rich Community it
 
02:19:41.629 --> 02:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
could be a $20,000 break uh right so
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
part of my answer is that uh of course
 
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
the committee uh owns the bill after the
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
hearing in if if that piece if there's
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
some wording that could address that
 
02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
concern that's possible that's that's
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
actually a good question uh my thinking
 
02:19:58.309 --> 02:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
is that if if any town is a rich
 
02:20:00.750 --> 02:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
Community the the folks who live in any
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
town uh that you know they know their
 
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
town and they know their circumstances
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
and finances and dyn Dynamics and and
 
02:20:14.349 --> 02:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
the folks who live there so uh I hadn't
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
thought of that but but that's something
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps a Comm might want to
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh address in some
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
fashion thank you thank
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
you further
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one
 
02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative um is it your
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that by changing the 100%
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
figure would that require a warrant
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
article the question is would going to
 
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
100% versus 4,000 require a warrant
 
02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:48.590 align:start position:0%
100% versus 4,000 require a warrant
article

02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
article
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh I would go to the good folks in
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County the experts on that
 
02:20:55.630 --> 02:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
and ask some some folks on that
 
02:20:58.030 --> 02:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee about that I uh it's great
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
question and and I I don't have a ready
 
02:21:03.150 --> 02:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
answer for that but that's a great
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
question I asked it only because I do
 
02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
know the answer
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
but I
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
wanted this will be for the executive
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
session or as we proceed I don't need to
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
talk about it right now okay further
 
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:18.510 align:start position:0%
talk about it right now okay further
questions

02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:21.670 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
m uh next up we have uh William Gad
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you again committee members uh
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
my name is William Gro a director for
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire division of veteran
 
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
services uh the uh Department of
 
02:21:44.590 --> 02:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
military's Affairs and Veteran servic
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
were neutral on this bill I I just
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to come up and bring some
 
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
information kind of along the lines I've
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
already spoken about uh while
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative maford is absolutely
 
02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
correct this would apply to John Smith
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
who may have been wounded in war and
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
came back here is now 100% permanent
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
total but this would also apply to John
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
Smith's brother Mike who is also 100%
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
permanent total and makes $200,000 a
 
02:22:10.990 --> 02:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
year so if you grant this to John you
 
02:22:12.990 --> 02:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
would be granting this to every in
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
within that City every other veteran
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
who's 100% permanent total but not have
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities that are significant enough
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
to keep them from being employed so i'
 
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
out representative
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I will ask
 
02:22:37.710 --> 02:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
the question that I was going to ask of
 
02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor because you brought it
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
up in your comments so you were
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
referring to permanent and total
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
disability where the text
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill and it's not being modified
 
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's in current statute only refers to
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
service connected total disability there
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
there's a difference there's no
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
difference no difference it's the same
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's just a it's just a the way it's
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
said some people say total and permanent
 
02:23:06.429 --> 02:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
some people say permanent in total it's
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
the same thing thank
 
02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um thank you for taking
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
the the question um
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
this uh potential change
 
02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:25.230 align:start position:0%
this uh potential change
essentially

02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh could make the bill that
 
02:23:31.630 --> 02:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
you just talked about
 
02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
essentially um moot because all of the
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
people that would be granted 100% under
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
that law would be could be granted 100%
 
02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
under this law um do you see that that
 
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
um is is uh a
 
02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:54.309 align:start position:0%
um is is uh a
concern

02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh or or do you think that uh that there
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
is some value in having both well
 
02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
because this legislation that just
 
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
proposed was enabling I don't think it
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
moots ours because there are maybe a
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
town out there that wouldn't put this
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
one forward but still would be able to
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
Grant and take SE take care of somebody
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
who's 100% perent total and as have
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
those grants
 
02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
uh through the through the VA so I don't
 
02:24:22.349 --> 02:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily think it moots our bill uh
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
it would moot our bill if this was being
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
presented as a law that every city was
 
02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
going to adopt and I think this that's
 
02:24:33.030 --> 02:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
way further questions seeing none thank
 
02:24:37.269 --> 02:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
you very much for your
 
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
testimony last pink card I have on this
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
so if anybody else was planning to speak
 
02:24:43.469 --> 02:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
make sure you fill out a pink card last
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%

one Jim
mishell

02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
um one comment for Mr misho and
 
02:25:04.269 --> 02:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
everybody here it really helps if you do
 
02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
have written testimony to get that to
 
02:25:09.309 --> 02:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
the committee in advance that way we can
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it's very helpful to see
 
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
it in advance but absolutely you can
 
02:25:15.269 --> 02:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
always turn it in at the meeting thank
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
you point taken thank you Mr chair Jim
 
02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
Mish show the town assessor and Hudson
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm neither for nor against this bill
 
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
I just look at some administrative
 
02:25:27.389 --> 02:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
aspects um as a point of reference
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
according to dr's online data for 2022
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
property tax year there were
 
02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
3,619 service connected total disability
 
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
tax credits for tax year 2022 which
 
02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
amounted to about $8.4 million and tax
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
dollars credited as opposed to
 
02:25:45.790 --> 02:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
exemptions before you go on what would
 
02:25:48.389 --> 02:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
the number again um the total number of
 
02:25:52.950 --> 02:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:55.469 --> 02:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
3,619 and these are tax credits as
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to exemptions right so this is
 
02:25:59.790 --> 02:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
this is dollars that gets shifted right
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
so it's Revenue neutral in the community
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
you grant an exemption you grant a
 
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
credit it just kind of lowers it plays
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
into the tax rate uh the community gets
 
02:26:11.150 --> 02:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
no less money for the ex credits and
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
exemptions granted so this works the
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
same way um in 2022 um the median was
 
02:26:22.349 --> 02:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
$1,400 the median tax credit 73
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
communities are at the minimum of 701 41
 
02:26:27.269 --> 02:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
communities are at the current maximum
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
of 4,000 and the rest of are in
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
between I do raise the following concern
 
02:26:34.110 --> 02:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
and and this is the first uh percentage
 
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
based tax credit tax exemption bill I
 
02:26:37.389 --> 02:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
think this committee has gotten this
 
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
year but consistent with prior years and
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
an has testified I have testified
 
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
percentage-based exemptions and tax
 
02:26:45.870 --> 02:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
credits do not work within the property
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
tax administration
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
um process that we have in New Hampshire
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
we have to know the
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
number so the chicken or the egg right
 
02:26:58.590 --> 02:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
the 100% of what 100% of the tax bill we
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what the tax bill is so we
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
already have our tax rate but we need to
 
02:27:03.269 --> 02:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of the credit or the
 
02:27:05.469 --> 02:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
exemption before we set the tax rate we
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
have to put it on the ms1 so uh a clean
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
change to this is change the $4,000
 
02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
number you know these clean numbers work
 
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
percentages just are not not able to be
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
administered flat out it no different
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
this year than it was in Prior years um
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
and I gave an example in my T in my
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
written testimony I'm not going to dive
 
02:27:30.309 --> 02:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
into it um but if you look back in any
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
of your bills from prior Years you'll
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
see the same kind of written and verbal
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
testimony percentages this don't work
 
02:27:39.309 --> 02:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
that's it thank
 
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
you for your representative
 
02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you for taking my question
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
just a quick question I don't know
 
02:27:50.269 --> 02:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
whether it was you or someone else who
 
02:27:53.469 --> 02:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
said it before basically that uh to make
 
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
sure we get the tax taxes straight that
 
02:27:59.070 --> 02:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
we would use the previous year's tax for
 
02:27:59.080 --> 02:27:59.950 align:start position:0%
we would use the previous year's tax for
that

02:27:59.950 --> 02:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:03.150 --> 02:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
individual as opposed to when we did an
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
exemption so you could use a previous
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
year's number instead of having to
 
02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
figure out what the current rate was for
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
that exemption is that correct thank you
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
for the question representative um if
 
02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
the legislation was change the proposal
 
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
was changed to state that
 
02:28:23.269 --> 02:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
um it's possible to to do that um
 
02:28:24.910 --> 02:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
because then you'd know the number right
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
you you'd know what the 100% is
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
um that might that might work not as
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
clean as a higher number clean make it
 
02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's difficult to administer
 
02:28:37.950 --> 02:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
these laws locally um not every
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
Community is the same and um I think a
 
02:28:42.429 --> 02:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
clean approach is is is a better
 
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
approach um we already have 41
 
02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
communities at the max maybe those 41 is
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
some of them want to go more than the
 
02:28:52.750 --> 02:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
you further
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
questions see you none thank you for
 
02:29:00.510 --> 02:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony having no more pink cards
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh blue sheet four people signed in
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
three neutral one
 
02:29:09.389 --> 02:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
four and three of those spoke in front
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
of us so with that we'll go ahead and
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on hb1 1250 eight and
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
believe it or not we are back on time on
 
02:29:25.429 --> 02:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
schedule uh we will start up again at
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
130 see everybody
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.520 --> 03:33:04.429 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:33:04.429 --> 03:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:33:25.830 --> 03:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:29.349 --> 03:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay we are past 130 we are going to
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
move on with our bills here next up
 
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:33:35.790 --> 03:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
1040 relative to including interest and
 
03:33:38.229 --> 03:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
an Abad property tax refund at the rate
 
03:33:42.110 --> 03:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
determined by the Department of Revenue
 
03:33:44.750 --> 03:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
Administration representative leus you
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:52.670 --> 03:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
floor thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:33:52.680 --> 03:33:54.269 align:start position:0%
floor thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

03:33:54.269 --> 03:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:33:59.189 --> 03:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
um so if you request a uh an abatement
 
03:34:00.870 --> 03:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
to your taxes in other words you think
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
your uh your assessment was too high you
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
still have to pay the full amount by the
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
due date and if your uh request for the
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
abatement succeeds then the town has to
 
03:34:14.189 --> 03:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
has to return the money um and pay
 
03:34:15.750 --> 03:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
interest on the time they kept it when
 
03:34:16.870 --> 03:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't
 
03:34:20.750 --> 03:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
have um little history on this back in
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh there was a bill SP 317 in
 
03:34:27.189 --> 03:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
2022 um that was put in by Senator
 
03:34:28.990 --> 03:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
Carson and that was generated at the
 
03:34:32.510 --> 03:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
request of the U Board of Selectmen in
 
03:34:33.710 --> 03:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
the town of Hudson I should have
 
03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned I I represent Hudson and
 
03:34:38.950 --> 03:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
Lichfield um because at that time
 
03:34:42.910 --> 03:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
interest rates were you know almost zero
 
03:34:45.389 --> 03:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
and the rate that the town was required
 
03:34:48.950 --> 03:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
to pay was 6% and rightly the Boris
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
selectman thought that that was too high
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
so a bill was put in to reduce it to 4%
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
at that time I thought the correct thing
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
to do was to uh base it on some index so
 
03:35:02.429 --> 03:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
that it would adjust as interest rates
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
adjust um but there wasn't time in the
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
process to come up with a good index and
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
amend the bill so the bill went through
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
so it's now 4% and and then you know
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
recently I when I was putting the bill
 
03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
in I looked at interest rates you get
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
almost you could at that time get almost
 
03:35:20.110 --> 03:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
6% just on a plain CD and so 4% wasn't
 
03:35:22.309 --> 03:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
fair to somebody getting the abatement
 
03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
back in 2022 6% wasn't fair to the town
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
and all the other
 
03:35:28.590 --> 03:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um so the problem is with a
 
03:35:30.189 --> 03:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
fixed rate most of the time it's going
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
to be wrong it's it's going to either
 
03:35:33.630 --> 03:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
favor one side or the other which it
 
03:35:36.030 --> 03:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't so I had a couple discussions
 
03:35:38.349 --> 03:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
with the uh State Treasurer to come up
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
with an index and we wanted something
 
03:35:42.990 --> 03:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
that was readily
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
available um you know just to make it
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
easier for the uh you know the people
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
administrating this in the
 
03:35:54.910 --> 03:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and um we settled on was
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh the Department of Revenue
 
03:35:59.670 --> 03:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
Administration has interest rates that
 
03:36:01.469 --> 03:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
they charge businesses for overpayment
 
03:36:05.309 --> 03:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
or underpayment of uh taxes like bet or
 
03:36:09.229 --> 03:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
BPT um and that's based on some other
 
03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know index I don't actually remember
 
03:36:14.469 --> 03:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
which one offand but that's you know
 
03:36:16.110 --> 03:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
always available on a on the State
 
03:36:17.830 --> 03:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
website it's kind of official from the
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
state and so it's always
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
accessible um I had actually thought of
 
03:36:25.269 --> 03:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
using a different index the liore but I
 
03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
learned from the which is used to be the
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
most common one used for medium uh term
 
03:36:33.030 --> 03:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
interest rates and the treasurer
 
03:36:35.070 --> 03:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately uh told me that that one was
 
03:36:36.630 --> 03:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
becoming disfavor was going away so
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
anyway what this bill would do is uh
 
03:36:43.870 --> 03:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
base the interest rate on uh a number
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
that comes from the DSA and RSA 21j and
 
03:36:49.510 --> 03:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh plus 2 percentage
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
points and that's that's basically what
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
the bill does and it'll solve this
 
03:36:54.910 --> 03:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
problem we won't keep getting bills
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
late okay thank you for your testimony
 
03:37:06.030 --> 03:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
03:37:09.070 --> 03:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee repres
 
03:37:14.189 --> 03:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
Brown yeah just reading the bill I was
 
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
curious why did they add uh plus two
 
03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
percentage points um I I took a look at
 
03:37:24.070 --> 03:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
what the numbers have been um
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
historically so they had been um brought
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
up to 6% when interest rates were in a
 
03:37:31.630 --> 03:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
certain range and they drop down to 4%
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
later probably they should be about 6%
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
now I at least when I put the bill in I
 
03:37:37.870 --> 03:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at interest rates in a
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
little while uh and and doing this you
 
03:37:43.070 --> 03:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
know looking at the numbers historically
 
03:37:46.110 --> 03:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
that have been on uh the Dr website this
 
03:37:49.110 --> 03:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
will yield um you know you would have
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
had the same interest rates we had
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
historically if this had been law at
 
03:37:55.630 --> 03:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
that time and so it it it basically
 
03:37:58.510 --> 03:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
follows what has been the interest rates
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
that have been used for this purpose in
 
03:38:02.309 --> 03:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
the past and
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
um you know that seemed like the way to
 
03:38:07.710 --> 03:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
go the the the thing to look at is that
 
03:38:11.710 --> 03:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at RSA 21j 28 it's
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
complicated and uh um you know this one
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
refers to um a paragraph 2 which is some
 
03:38:23.229 --> 03:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
other index you know minus
 
03:38:29.349 --> 03:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
3% so this um and that's the one for
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
um overpayment of tax and I think the
 
03:38:36.030 --> 03:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
way the Dr did it they're
 
03:38:38.790 --> 03:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh I don't you know arguably not giving
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
businesses back as much as they should
 
03:38:42.269 --> 03:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
should for over payment but mainly I did
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
this because it it follows what's been
 
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
done in the past and
 
03:38:51.389 --> 03:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
so follow up Mr chairman follow I'm not
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you understood specifically
 
03:38:55.189 --> 03:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
what I was saying I was saying if the
 
03:38:57.269 --> 03:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Services is is
 
03:38:58.990 --> 03:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
coming up with an interest
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
rate I would think they would calculate
 
03:39:02.910 --> 03:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
it based on what the current rate had
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
been and then they would assess that
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
payment to the town for
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
overpayment as opposed to PL thinking
 
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
like the plus 2% is a penalty or
 
03:39:15.150 --> 03:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
something you understand what I'm saying
 
03:39:19.990 --> 03:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
I do understand and um I mean if the
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
committee wants to change that of course
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're welcome to but I put it
 
03:39:27.790 --> 03:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
that way so that it would follow what
 
03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
that interest rate has been historically
 
03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
for tax abatements I wasn't trying to
 
03:39:35.469 --> 03:39:35.479 align:start position:0%
change you know that balance between the
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
town and and the or the other taxpayers
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
and the and the person getting the
 
03:39:39.239 --> 03:39:42.189 align:start position:0%
and the and the person getting the
abatement

03:39:42.189 --> 03:39:42.199 align:start position:0%
abatement
 
03:39:44.790 --> 03:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative sis thank you Mr chair
 
03:39:46.429 --> 03:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
03:39:48.189 --> 03:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
my question and why did you ever leave
 
03:39:50.830 --> 03:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
03:39:50.840 --> 03:39:53.229 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
government

03:39:53.229 --> 03:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:39:57.309 --> 03:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
um explain to me why following up on
 
03:40:00.189 --> 03:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
representative Brown's question tagging
 
03:40:03.309 --> 03:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
on plus two percentage points at the end
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
of the the bill doesn't defeat the very
 
03:40:09.389 --> 03:40:09.399 align:start position:0%
purpose that your bill is trying to
 
03:40:11.950 --> 03:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
accomplish in other words aren't you
 
03:40:15.070 --> 03:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
aren't you creating uh a an interest
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
rate that may not be in sync with the
 
03:40:21.309 --> 03:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
Times by adding that 2% on um I would
 
03:40:24.910 --> 03:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
argue no because the interest rate that
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's adjusting by the two percentage
 
03:40:28.590 --> 03:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
Point does vary based on general
 
03:40:31.550 --> 03:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
interest rate conditions um that's what
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
the drra rate is based on so it will
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
follow the interest rate and the times
 
03:40:39.510 --> 03:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not going to try and read
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
dr's mind on why they decided to to do
 
03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
it the way they did for
 
03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
businesses but uh my goal was to you
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
know if if you look at when the rates
 
03:40:52.710 --> 03:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
were adjusted in the past to have this
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
generate the same thing so that it would
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
have been you know when the legislature
 
03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
decided to to set it to 6% this would
 
03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
have made it six looking at the
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
Historical Dr numbers and when it went
 
03:41:04.590 --> 03:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
to four this would have made it four and
 
03:41:07.550 --> 03:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
so it should follow what the legislature
 
03:41:10.830 --> 03:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
has done concerning uh batement interest
 
03:41:13.349 --> 03:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
rates in the past I wasn't trying to
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
tilt the thing either you know more in
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
favor of the person in the abatement or
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
more in favor of the town or you could
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
look at it as all the other taxpayers
 
03:41:24.510 --> 03:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
just to keep that balance the
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
same I was just trying to avoid the
 
03:41:27.710 --> 03:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
committee having to deal with these
 
03:41:30.429 --> 03:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
bills every couple of
 
03:41:33.070 --> 03:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
years further
 
03:41:35.189 --> 03:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very

Hudson uh I'm here to testify in House
 
03:43:24.640 --> 03:43:25.630 align:start position:0%
Hudson uh I'm here to testify in House
Bill

03:43:25.630 --> 03:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:43:28.750 --> 03:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
1040 um my written testimony gives a
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of history on how we are at
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
the 4% it was just two years ago that
 
03:43:34.990 --> 03:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
the general court adopted the change
 
03:43:38.030 --> 03:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
from 6 to 4% um this committee voted in
 
03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
favor of it 19 to zero voted ought to
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
pass by the Full House in the consent
 
03:43:44.790 --> 03:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
calendar that Bill had seven sponsors
 
03:43:46.269 --> 03:43:46.279 align:start position:0%
one of the sponsors is my representative
 
03:43:48.790 --> 03:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
leas in back of me from Hudson uh who's
 
03:43:51.469 --> 03:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
now the sole sponsor of this bill um and
 
03:43:52.990 --> 03:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
the the bill had zero opposition at the
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing process at the Senate
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
level um picking up on comments from
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
past bills from tax collectors when
 
03:44:03.309 --> 03:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt in uh
 
03:44:08.830 --> 03:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
2018 to tie abatement interest and or uh
 
03:44:10.950 --> 03:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
underpayment right property tax payments
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt back then to tie it
 
03:44:16.149 --> 03:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
to the state uh Dr interest rates so in
 
03:44:17.389 --> 03:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
discussions with tax collectors
 
03:44:19.469 --> 03:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
including Hudson's the bill as written
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
would require some software changes um
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
for each municipality and that could be
 
03:44:25.389 --> 03:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
some additional cost right we're going
 
03:44:27.070 --> 03:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
to be changing the rate of
 
03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
interest um the Dr overpayment rate
 
03:44:32.630 --> 03:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
changes annually on a calendar year
 
03:44:35.349 --> 03:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
basis um so different interest rates
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
will be calculated for each year um the
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
software would be required to track and
 
03:44:43.349 --> 03:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
then determine based on the length and
 
03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
the number of years um um how much
 
03:44:48.510 --> 03:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
interest is going to be charged for each
 
03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
year currently it's one rate it's 4% um
 
03:44:54.189 --> 03:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
this would require each year to be
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
separately calculated by the tax
 
03:45:00.149 --> 03:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
collector um the uh prior legislation as
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
I said uh in House Bill 1673 in 2018
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
sought to align it the general court
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
rejected that um that's when they
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
changed the late payment interest rates
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
from 18 and 12 to 14 and 8 and then
 
03:45:14.710 --> 03:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
subsequently the legislature passed the
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
change in AB batment add from 6% to 4%
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
so fixed non-fluctuating um year to year
 
03:45:22.510 --> 03:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers know what the interest
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
rate is year to year the communities
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
know what the interest rate is um the
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
state determines its interest rate uh on
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
a calendar year basis but the towns
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
administer assessments and abatements on
 
03:45:39.389 --> 03:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
a property tax year basis so if I apply
 
03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
for an abatement in Hudson in 2023
 
03:45:45.189 --> 03:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
November 15th and the abatement is
 
03:45:48.429 --> 03:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
granted if this comes into pass I will
 
03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
get one interest rate times my principal
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
but if the town doesn't process the
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
abatement till after January 1st it's
 
03:45:57.910 --> 03:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
going to be a different interest rate So
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
within the same
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
Community ta different taxpayers will
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
have different interest rates that their
 
03:46:07.750 --> 03:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
abatement is calculated off of we don't
 
03:46:09.389 --> 03:46:09.399 align:start position:0%
have that currently currently we have it
 
03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
it's the same from year to year but if
 
03:46:15.309 --> 03:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
this passes it would change from year to
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
it would change within the tax year
 
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
within the same community and you know
 
03:46:21.630 --> 03:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
if that's if that's fine then that then
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
that's that'll work right but people
 
03:46:26.189 --> 03:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
will be treated differently
 
03:46:28.389 --> 03:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
lastly um the change in 22 didn't have
 
03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the interest rates
 
03:46:34.950 --> 03:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
the change in the abatement interests it
 
03:46:37.790 --> 03:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
had to do with um catching up to the
 
03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
change the legislature had made in the
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
under in the underpayment rates again
 
03:46:44.830 --> 03:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
that went from 18 to 12 to 14 and 8 so
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
there was no no discussion back then in
 
03:46:48.990 --> 03:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony and nothing I heard about
 
03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
interest rates um further the states
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
mostly dealing with corporations and
 
03:46:56.349 --> 03:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
businesses most of our communities are
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with individual
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um and having to explain
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
different interest rates to different
 
03:47:04.670 --> 03:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and why they're treated
 
03:47:07.229 --> 03:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
differently in the same year I'm not so
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
sure that that's going to be a fun uh
 
03:47:12.670 --> 03:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
fun enjoyment for the tax collectors
 
03:47:21.790 --> 03:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:24.790 --> 03:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
testimony okay thank you um I didn't
 
03:47:26.429 --> 03:47:26.439 align:start position:0%
catch it at the beginning if you said it
 
03:47:29.670 --> 03:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
are you opposed neutral or against uh or
 
03:47:31.469 --> 03:47:31.479 align:start position:0%
for my board of selectman's last
 
03:47:33.630 --> 03:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
position on this was to ask Senator
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
Carson to introduce it at 4% so I'm
 
03:47:37.389 --> 03:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
going to go with their last position on
 
03:47:39.309 --> 03:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
this and I'll support their position
 
03:47:41.229 --> 03:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
that that uh I'm in I'm in favor of the
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
current and not again and not not in
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
favor of this B you would be opposed I
 
03:47:45.910 --> 03:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to this bill based upon
 
03:47:48.189 --> 03:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
the selectman's past history are there
 
03:47:52.830 --> 03:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.149 --> 03:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
misho seeing none I have one and maybe
 
03:47:59.670 --> 03:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
this will save n from having to come up
 
03:48:02.349 --> 03:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
um and I mentioned with uh
 
03:48:02.359 --> 03:48:03.910 align:start position:0%
um and I mentioned with uh
representative

03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
leus to me the rsas as they're written
 
03:48:11.710 --> 03:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
now are a little bit confusing to me
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
3 it gives me some numbers and then it
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
says oh yeah and then apply these
 
03:48:24.910 --> 03:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
28-2 is it your opinion that there would
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
be a much easier
 
03:48:35.790 --> 03:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
way to have the rsa's read to avoid one
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
RSA sending you to another when you're
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
playing with all kinds kind of different
 
03:48:43.950 --> 03:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
figures well yeah I'm in favor of How
 
03:48:46.149 --> 03:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
It's currently written I mean that would
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
be my solution to it I but no that's not
 
03:48:52.229 --> 03:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm I don't May well maybe you
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
understood what I said maybe I don't
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:00.670 --> 03:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
asking couldn't you couldn't there be an
 
03:49:04.229 --> 03:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
RSA written to incorporate two N3 into a
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
single RSA that's a little less
 
03:49:08.590 --> 03:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
confusing or am I missing something not
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
speaking for the Department Revenue
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
because they can speak for themselves um
 
03:49:14.550 --> 03:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
I I would say that there probably is a
 
03:49:16.110 --> 03:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
probability you could write it where
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
they combined okay thank you I did have
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
one last thing I wanted to add um so
 
03:49:24.030 --> 03:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
this the proposal says that the rate
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
determined by the
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
Dr okay which rate the prior year rate
 
03:49:32.189 --> 03:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
the current year rate the calendar year
 
03:49:34.830 --> 03:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
rate the property tax year rate so
 
03:49:36.030 --> 03:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably just a little bit
 
03:49:36.040 --> 03:49:37.149 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably just a little bit
of

03:49:37.149 --> 03:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
clarity thank you
 
03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you further
 
03:49:47.469 --> 03:49:47.479 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
testimony again I did have a card from
 
03:49:53.189 --> 03:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
Katherine Heck from all right I guess n
 
03:49:53.199 --> 03:49:54.389 align:start position:0%
Katherine Heck from all right I guess n
is

03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:49:58.189 --> 03:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
Gonna Fill in Mr chair I'm happy to come
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
up and uh do my best impression of
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
Catherine and you can all mock me later
 
03:50:05.149 --> 03:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
very good um I'm I'm n gra the municipal
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
Association uh we do oppose the bill um
 
03:50:11.469 --> 03:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
I believe uh Mr misho laid out uh most
 
03:50:15.950 --> 03:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
of our points um to answer the chair's
 
03:50:19.269 --> 03:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
question I do concur with the chair that
 
03:50:24.590 --> 03:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
it is it is a bit confusing to write uh
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh to to reference um j28 uh 3 and then
 
03:50:33.309 --> 03:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
in that ref reference two um I think it
 
03:50:36.429 --> 03:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
it may be possible to clarify
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
that uh we we do as I mentioned we do
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill um and I think the last
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
point that Mr misho made was one of the
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
major points that we have based on the
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
notes that I have in front of me um
 
03:50:50.710 --> 03:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
which is that we do need to have clarity
 
03:50:53.710 --> 03:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
about what interest rate to apply when
 
03:50:55.870 --> 03:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
um is there a cutof date at you know
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
December 31st or how how exactly does
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
that work it doesn't it appears not to
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
be clear based on the um individuals
 
03:51:07.990 --> 03:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
that Katherine uh contacted about this
 
03:51:11.110 --> 03:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
as to how that would function in
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
practice thank you there any
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one yes
 
03:51:24.469 --> 03:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
um would it be possible that the N
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
nhma yourself and maybe somebody else
 
03:51:30.670 --> 03:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
maybe the current sponsor even though
 
03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
the I know you don't like the direction
 
03:51:35.790 --> 03:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
of where this is going and I'm not in
 
03:51:38.510 --> 03:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
disagreement but maybe to take and use
 
03:51:40.189 --> 03:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
this as a vehicle vcle
 
03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
to make those two paragraphs clearer
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
03:51:47.750 --> 03:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
possible we're always happy to work on
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
amendments Mr chair and I'm certainly
 
03:51:51.870 --> 03:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
happy to volunteer my colleague
 
03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
Katherine heck to do
 
03:51:56.870 --> 03:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
so okay if you could relay that to miss
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
heck that would be great I will do so Mr
 
03:52:00.670 --> 03:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
you uh anybody else wishing to speak I
 
03:52:05.359 --> 03:52:07.110 align:start position:0%
you uh anybody else wishing to speak I
don't

03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:52:11.790 --> 03:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:16.469 --> 03:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
um uh you yeah thank you n well set just
 
03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
make sure you fill out a pink card for
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
us before you
 
03:52:22.030 --> 03:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
leave you don't have to do it right now
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
leave good afternoon Mr chair and
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Keen
 
03:52:35.070 --> 03:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
M Wong tax policy Council from new hsh
 
03:52:37.149 --> 03:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration uh
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
I have not prepared any testimony for
 
03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
this this bill um the Dr is does not
 
03:52:44.349 --> 03:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
have a position on this bill but I heard
 
03:52:47.110 --> 03:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
some questions relating to the
 
03:52:50.550 --> 03:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
calculation of the uh interest rates on
 
03:52:54.510 --> 03:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
from RSA 21 j28 and I I'll be glad to
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
provide some clarification on that so um
 
03:53:01.550 --> 03:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
the rates on that's given in well the
 
03:53:04.830 --> 03:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
calculation method essentially uh in 21
 
03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
j28 um two uh Roman 2 refers to the
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
calculation for the underpayment of
 
03:53:15.630 --> 03:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
taxes and then uh Roman Tree refers to
 
03:53:17.229 --> 03:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
the calculation of overpayment of taxes
 
03:53:19.710 --> 03:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
and this relates to all all the other
 
03:53:22.229 --> 03:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
taxes that Dr administers and does not
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
apply to property
 
03:53:28.710 --> 03:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
taxes and the uh the source of these um
 
03:53:34.030 --> 03:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers are from the federal uh IRC
 
03:53:39.790 --> 03:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
6621 Internal Revenue code of um 6 6621
 
03:53:44.149 --> 03:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
A2 uh and that is provided from the um
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to say that that is where we
 
03:53:49.630 --> 03:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
the Dr will obtain the the rates to
 
03:53:50.670 --> 03:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
start the
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
calculation and then
 
03:53:57.269 --> 03:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
to for the underpayment of taxes so the
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
Dr looks at the rates for uh September
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
of every year and calculates the rates
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
for the next calendar year as the
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that we calculate the
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
rates for on calendar year
 
03:54:14.349 --> 03:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
basis and we issue the Dr issues those
 
03:54:17.149 --> 03:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
rates uh through a technical information
 
03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
release and it's published on our
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
website on on every on every
 
03:54:23.429 --> 03:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
September the interest rates for
 
03:54:26.469 --> 03:54:26.479 align:start position:0%
underpayment is using the Internal
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue code 6621
 
03:54:32.750 --> 03:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
rate plus 2% that's based on the statute
 
03:54:34.910 --> 03:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
and then to calculate the overpayment
 
03:54:36.670 --> 03:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
the interest rate on the overpayment
 
03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's using whatever rate that's already
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
been calculated so that plus 2% and then
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
minus 3% also that is uh as provided by
 
03:54:47.790 --> 03:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
the statute and every year that rate
 
03:54:51.389 --> 03:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
changes the current the current rate for
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2024 is 9% for
 
03:54:58.030 --> 03:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
underpayment of taxes and 6% for
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
overpayment of taxes uh based on my
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
reading of HB
 
03:55:07.349 --> 03:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
1040 what I I believe what it will do is
 
03:55:11.469 --> 03:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
then um that 6% that's the overpayment
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's calculated by
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
Dr plus another
 
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
2% um and and oh yes and I think there
 
03:55:23.790 --> 03:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
was some question about um how how the
 
03:55:26.830 --> 03:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh interest rates are then being applied
 
03:55:29.189 --> 03:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
so uh if that in an overpayment
 
03:55:33.670 --> 03:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
situation um the let's say if uh the
 
03:55:37.389 --> 03:55:37.399 align:start position:0%
currently the interest rate is 6% so the
 
03:55:39.630 --> 03:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be 6% and then calculated
 
03:55:42.510 --> 03:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
on the number of days that the uh that
 
03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
the Dr owes the money back to the
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayer uh for 2024 and if if it
 
03:55:50.670 --> 03:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
relates back to the payment since 23
 
03:55:53.590 --> 03:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
then it goes back to 4% for the 23 and
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
then 6% for the 24 so it's calculating
 
03:55:59.149 --> 03:55:59.159 align:start position:0%

clown show that uh uh I last time I was
 
03:59:36.269 --> 03:59:36.279 align:start position:0%
here relative to this bill uh that was
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
my ugly twin uh the
 
03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
paternal paternal twin at any at any
 
03:59:46.149 --> 03:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
rate first off uh I wish to emphasize
 
03:59:48.910 --> 03:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill only affects the Zoning
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment uh hearings it does not
 
03:59:56.910 --> 03:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
affect zoning ordinances or rezoning in
 
04:00:00.429 --> 04:00:00.439 align:start position:0%
addition it does not affect a Butters
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
who by law must be notified by verified
 
04:00:07.469 --> 04:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
mail it only repeat only affects
 
04:00:09.790 --> 04:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
notification to the general
 
04:00:13.750 --> 04:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
public right now the the public notice
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
for a zoning Board of adjustment hearing
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
can only be done by publication in a
 
04:00:21.550 --> 04:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
newspaper of General circulation in the
 
04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
area House Bill 1086 would allow the
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
publication of notice in the
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
municipality's internet website let's
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
compare the two processes in the
 
04:00:37.710 --> 04:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
internet system which was being proposed
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
a municipal IAL clerk would type up and
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
format the notice and put the on the and
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
put it on the municipality's internet
 
04:00:49.830 --> 04:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
website the clerk would build the
 
04:00:52.910 --> 04:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
applicant for clerical costs in the
 
04:00:56.469 --> 04:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
newspaper system the clerk would type up
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
the notice and mail either by stamp or
 
04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
email the notice to the publisher the
 
04:01:06.309 --> 04:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
publisher would prepare the copy print
 
04:01:09.189 --> 04:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
and distribute the newspaper and send an
 
04:01:12.149 --> 04:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
invoice to the clerk who would pay the
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
invoice and Bill the applicant for uh
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
both the clerical costs and the
 
04:01:20.189 --> 04:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
publishing costs the newspaper system is
 
04:01:24.189 --> 04:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
thus more costly to the applicant it is
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
also more costly to the
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
citizens because they have to buy the
 
04:01:32.750 --> 04:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
newspaper imagine what would happen if
 
04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
the clerk decided to charge all of each
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
of us for the calendar I don't think I'd
 
04:01:43.469 --> 04:01:43.479 align:start position:0%
like it I don't know about you uh let's
 
04:01:45.830 --> 04:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
look at the effectiveness in the
 
04:01:49.469 --> 04:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
newspaper system the notice will be
 
04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
printed in in one
 
04:01:55.149 --> 04:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
issue was basically one day of the
 
04:01:58.590 --> 04:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
newspaper is usually near classifi or
 
04:01:58.600 --> 04:02:00.950 align:start position:0%
newspaper is usually near classifi or
local

04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.070 --> 04:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
news a newspaper must be purchased it
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
also has a limited shelf life being
 
04:02:12.149 --> 04:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
before it's discarded in the internet
 
04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
system that's being proposed the notice
 
04:02:17.550 --> 04:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
would be on the website from the time
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's posted at least 5 days before the
 
04:02:23.469 --> 04:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
hearing the notice or the direct link to
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
the notice would be required to be
 
04:02:29.870 --> 04:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
posted prominently on the website's
 
04:02:33.110 --> 04:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
homepage in in addition the 5-day
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
requirements is a minimum so the notice
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
could be posted earlier and thus
 
04:02:42.030 --> 04:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
displayed even longer and the internet
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
system is free repeat free to the
 
04:02:49.710 --> 04:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
citizen they don't have to pay for
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
it they
 
04:02:55.269 --> 04:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
don't excuse me free you don't have to
 
04:02:58.990 --> 04:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
pay to get into the website is what I
 
04:03:02.429 --> 04:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
meant times change people get their
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
information different differently excuse
 
04:03:08.590 --> 04:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
me once it was only newspapers then
 
04:03:10.790 --> 04:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
radio then television and now the
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
internet The Proposal allows this this
 
04:03:16.510 --> 04:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
proposal allows notification to the be
 
04:03:19.030 --> 04:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
the most people for the least expense
 
04:03:22.710 --> 04:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
for the citizens the applicants and the
 
04:03:24.510 --> 04:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities thank
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%

04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh representative
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
FR did I say that right by the way
 
04:03:35.429 --> 04:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
perfect yes thank you thank you Mr
 
04:03:39.389 --> 04:03:39.399 align:start position:0%
chairman I have two questions um the
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
first is I noticed that this only your
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
your bill only applies to zba notices
 
04:03:50.590 --> 04:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
yes it does there there are other boards
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
land use boards and non-land use boards
 
04:03:58.870 --> 04:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
that are also required to post notices
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
of hearing in the local newspaper why
 
04:04:05.710 --> 04:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
are you not including them uh this is
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
only on the Zoning Board of adjustment
 
04:04:07.680 --> 04:04:08.550 align:start position:0%
only on the Zoning Board of adjustment
simple

04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
simple
 
04:04:13.229 --> 04:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
because uh this is what was asked by the
 
04:04:17.910 --> 04:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh by the zoning administrator at the
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
time uh the zone and it also the U far
 
04:04:26.349 --> 04:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
as the other land use board it is my
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
understanding in another part of the
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
land use law that you are allowed or t
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
they the towns are allowed to notify uh
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
for the um for the planning
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
board uh in a different manner uh if I
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
is I think if I'm not mistaken uh uh it
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know the exact number but I can
 
04:04:55.149 --> 04:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
find it for you if you'd like I I would
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that information if you could
 
04:05:00.750 --> 04:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh Supply it my second question if I may
 
04:05:03.950 --> 04:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair follow up yes go ahead
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
um have you done any studies on the law
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
of Revenue to the local newspapers as a
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
result of this proposed bill um we know
 
04:05:18.269 --> 04:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
that local
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
papers have experienced a reduction in
 
04:05:21.920 --> 04:05:24.110 align:start position:0%
papers have experienced a reduction in
advertising

04:05:24.110 --> 04:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
04:05:27.550 --> 04:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
overall and
 
04:05:29.469 --> 04:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't think that
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
applies um and I'm wondering what effect
 
04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
if any the reduction in interview would
 
04:05:38.800 --> 04:05:40.510 align:start position:0%
if any the reduction in interview would
uh

04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
result I I really don't know I really I
 
04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
can uh I I expect that it might be a
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
reduction in in Revenue but uh we here
 
04:05:55.630 --> 04:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
legislators should not want should not
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
try to play winner or
 
04:06:06.149 --> 04:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
loser uh and we should uh you know we
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
should we should look for the best what
 
04:06:11.950 --> 04:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
we can do for the for the citizens and
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers
 
04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh I uh in addition U if I think my
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
friends from Lichfield will know the uh
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
you will recall the Hudson Lichfield
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
news which was a weekly that I don't
 
04:06:36.149 --> 04:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
know if he real knows I doubt it but it
 
04:06:43.269 --> 04:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
Incorporated uh I'm the R so I actually
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
did own for a while a uh a weekly
 
04:06:58.990 --> 04:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
newspaper we used to publish the
 
04:07:02.110 --> 04:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh the the uh
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
notifications one thing that we were we
 
04:07:05.520 --> 04:07:06.710 align:start position:0%
notifications one thing that we were we
were

04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
free and none and also we went to every
 
04:07:17.149 --> 04:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
home in Hudson and Lichfield by mail so
 
04:07:20.149 --> 04:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
it but so it
 
04:07:25.030 --> 04:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
was that was the the so we met the the
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications of being uh able to get
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
the in the public information to the
 
04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
maximum number of of uh people of of
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
cost representative
 
04:07:49.469 --> 04:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
awood thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:07:53.149 --> 04:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
representative as I looked at this I was
 
04:07:57.630 --> 04:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about absentee property owners
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
who might be able to prove that the
 
04:08:04.030 --> 04:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
application could adversely or affect
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
their property and they would have to
 
04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
check town website every 4 days let's
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
say I just learned that some websites
 
04:08:15.550 --> 04:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
can you can
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
subscribe and it will push out notices
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
to people
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
subscribing um have you thought about
 
04:08:26.070 --> 04:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
specifying that this
 
04:08:29.550 --> 04:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
would only be applicable to town
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
websites that have that
 
04:08:35.790 --> 04:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
ability um and make it instead of in lie
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
of in addition to uh the newspaper
 
04:08:44.830 --> 04:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
advertising uh I have not uh considered
 
04:08:46.510 --> 04:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
that but I'd be
 
04:08:51.030 --> 04:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
welcome if the board if the uh committee
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
would like a a a uh uh an amendment to
 
04:08:58.870 --> 04:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
that I would be uh happy to
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
participate thank
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
you represent Davis thank you Mr chair
 
04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my
 
04:09:08.830 --> 04:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
question several years ago this
 
04:09:12.550 --> 04:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
committee passed a a bill vote voted in
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
favor of a bill to um to permit posting
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
of public meeting notices on
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
websites um I'm my concern and my
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
question for you has to do with
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
potential conflict between your bill and
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 91
 
04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
A2 which states that if a public body
 
04:09:39.429 --> 04:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
maintains an internet website it shall
 
04:09:41.710 --> 04:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
either Post Its approved minutes or
 
04:09:44.429 --> 04:09:44.439 align:start position:0%
notice of meeting in a reasonably
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
accessible location but it doesn't
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
insist that it do so so 91a 91a deals
 
04:09:54.030 --> 04:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
with all meetings open to the
 
04:09:57.870 --> 04:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
public and that's what that law state
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
which in my mind would supersede the
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
very narrow application just to
 
04:10:09.109 --> 04:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
zba uh I don't necessarily
 
04:10:13.630 --> 04:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
I that I cannot answer I don't I think
 
04:10:19.149 --> 04:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
the 91a issue is simply uh is is is
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
Broad this is
 
04:10:25.630 --> 04:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
specific uh the I know that uh the town
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
of Hudson uh there's another that there
 
04:10:29.600 --> 04:10:30.389 align:start position:0%
of Hudson uh there's another that there
is

04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:10:34.189 --> 04:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
another uh there's
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
another uh statue that allows the Zoning
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment to uh to brought to
 
04:10:47.710 --> 04:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
get to put out their notifications in a
 
04:10:47.720 --> 04:10:48.750 align:start position:0%
get to put out their notifications in a
different

04:10:48.750 --> 04:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
manner uh and they do it actually
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
through the uh the Z to the publication
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
through the um uh uh through their rule
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
through their uh site plan regulations
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
so uh they have a system in that seems
 
04:11:07.800 --> 04:11:08.710 align:start position:0%
so uh they have a system in that seems
to

04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:11:13.070 --> 04:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you Mr chairman and to the
 
04:11:22.349 --> 04:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
representative's point 91a uses the word
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
meeting and a meeting is where the
 
04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
public is allowed to speak there's some
 
04:11:30.750 --> 04:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity a hearing a public hearing
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
is not the
 
04:11:35.750 --> 04:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
same it's a convening of a board of a
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
public body but I think the reason this
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
is separate from 91a is because they
 
04:11:46.990 --> 04:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.429 --> 04:11:50.439 align:start position:0%
91a thank you I didn't ask a question
 
04:11:50.439 --> 04:11:52.070 align:start position:0%
91a thank you I didn't ask a question
I'm

04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
point further questions or points uh
 
04:12:02.910 --> 04:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee no M
 
04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
Representative kahill no you good all
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%

04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%

04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
speak on 1086 that you have a pink card
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
Grace thank you Mr chair this actually
 
04:12:30.269 --> 04:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
is my bill n Grace the municipal
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
Association we do support this
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
legislation um the committee had a
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
number of questions uh I just say that I
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
agree with um the opening statements of
 
04:12:42.309 --> 04:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
Representative Ren Zulo summarizing the
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
importance of this bill and how it would
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
affect municipalities applicants and
 
04:12:51.109 --> 04:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um representative fra and
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative stavis had a couple of
 
04:12:56.429 --> 04:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
related questions um about why there's
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
this specific notice as compared to um
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know why this only applies to cbas
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
versus you know uh the right to no law
 
04:13:09.790 --> 04:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
91a um and part of what 91a says is that
 
04:13:13.030 --> 04:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
there are other Provisions within the
 
04:13:15.149 --> 04:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
statutes that have more specific notice
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
requirements one of those sections is
 
04:13:22.910 --> 04:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
this section on uh notice of zba
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
hearings um and so it requires an
 
04:13:29.229 --> 04:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
additional step um not only does that
 
04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
publication have to occur uh in two
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
public places but it also has to be
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
published in a public
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
newspaper um so so there's this specific
 
04:13:41.790 --> 04:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
requirement and what this bill would do
 
04:13:44.510 --> 04:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
is allow publication on the website
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
instead of um instead of a newspaper and
 
04:13:50.109 --> 04:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
I'll note this is a local option I
 
04:13:52.269 --> 04:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
assume not all towns will take advantage
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
of this because there are five towns in
 
04:13:55.590 --> 04:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that do not
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
have websites so obviously they would be
 
04:14:01.109 --> 04:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
ineligible to qualify for publication on
 
04:14:01.119 --> 04:14:01.870 align:start position:0%
ineligible to qualify for publication on
their

04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:14:06.750 --> 04:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
website um uh representative fract also
 
04:14:06.760 --> 04:14:07.750 align:start position:0%
website um uh representative fract also
uh

04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:09.790 --> 04:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
as part of his initial question there
 
04:14:10.670 --> 04:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:14:16.870 --> 04:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
zba um RSA 675 colon7 Roman
 
04:14:20.590 --> 04:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
1B um talks about public hearing notices
 
04:14:23.149 --> 04:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
of zoning amendments those may be
 
04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
published to the website um as
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
well um I believe there was a bill in
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
the past um that sought to change a
 
04:14:36.750 --> 04:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
number of these more specific uh notice
 
04:14:40.469 --> 04:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
requ requirements to allow uh internet
 
04:14:42.630 --> 04:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
publication instead of in
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
newspapers um at that time the committee
 
04:14:48.550 --> 04:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
had a number of concerns and wanted to
 
04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
um go through those one by one um so
 
04:14:55.149 --> 04:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
this is one of those um
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
and uh as far as representative award
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
asked a question about um subscriptions
 
04:15:05.670 --> 04:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
to uh internet calendars I don't believe
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
there's currently anything in legis
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
ation requiring that be uh requiring
 
04:15:13.950 --> 04:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
that occur if you have a website um but
 
04:15:16.109 --> 04:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
I just want to point that out happy to
 
04:15:17.550 --> 04:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
take any other questions the committee
 
04:15:17.560 --> 04:15:19.149 align:start position:0%
take any other questions the committee
may

04:15:19.149 --> 04:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:15:19.159 --> 04:15:22.309 align:start position:0%
may
have

04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you thank you
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
for your
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
testimony was there anybody else wanting
 
04:15:31.389 --> 04:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
to speak on this
 
04:15:33.870 --> 04:15:33.880 align:start position:0%

okay we're at the pointed hour we'll go
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
ahead and open up the hearing on HB

members of the committee my name is

04:17:00.030 --> 04:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
going to introduce you to HB

1342 relative to the licensing of

electronic literary materials by
 
04:17:08.590 --> 04:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
libraries this Bill seeks to prohibit
 
04:17:11.229 --> 04:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
book publishers from Contracting ebook
 
04:17:15.070 --> 04:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
licenses with libraries on terms grossly
 
04:17:17.550 --> 04:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
different than those available to the
 
04:17:20.349 --> 04:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
public it does so by making such
 
04:17:22.349 --> 04:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
contracts that are different than those
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
available to the public unfair and
 
04:17:27.389 --> 04:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
deceptive per the state's consumer
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
protection act and thus prosecutable by
 
04:17:33.030 --> 04:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
our States Attorney General's office it
 
04:17:34.870 --> 04:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
also creates a private right of action
 
04:17:37.349 --> 04:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
for grieved libraries
 
04:17:39.550 --> 04:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
ebooks have become a popular and
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
environmentally efficient means of book
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
lending but for libraries ebooks come
 
04:17:48.429 --> 04:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
with a hefty price libraries which
 
04:17:51.510 --> 04:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
purchase paper copy books retain some
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
privileges over those books due to the
 
04:17:57.590 --> 04:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
first sale Doctrine in US copyright law
 
04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
that is the possessor of a physical copy
 
04:18:04.670 --> 04:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
of a book May lend that copy of will or
 
04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
even sell that copy without further
 
04:18:09.630 --> 04:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
intervention from the publisher the
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
relationship between the library and the
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
publisher completes at the sale of the
 
04:18:19.309 --> 04:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
book but those paper copy privileges do
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
not translate to
 
04:18:24.510 --> 04:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
ebooks rather ebooks are not governed by
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
copyright law they're governed by
 
04:18:30.750 --> 04:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
contract law that is the license drafted
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
between the Lor and the lensey sets the
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
terms of how the ebook will be used used
 
04:18:40.269 --> 04:18:40.279 align:start position:0%
and distributed the publisher can limit
 
04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
the number of times an ebook can be
 
04:18:45.149 --> 04:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
borrowed from a library or require that
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
the license for the ebook be repurchased
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
at set
 
04:18:52.429 --> 04:18:52.439 align:start position:0%

contract terms Publishers set for
 
04:18:57.870 --> 04:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
libraries are often Draconian leaving
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
many institutions with a tough choice of
 
04:19:04.149 --> 04:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
coughing up exorbitant fees repeatedly
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
or NAA offering ebooks at all
 
04:19:09.309 --> 04:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
at a time when they're of increasing use
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
in interest for instance an ebook which
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
might cost a consumer
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
$9.99 often costs a library between $40
 
04:19:18.960 --> 04:19:19.750 align:start position:0%
$9.99 often costs a library between $40
and

04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
$110 for the Same Book for a limited
 
04:19:26.830 --> 04:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
license frequently that license lasts
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
for either two years or a limited number
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
of checkouts regardless of whether the
 
04:19:34.830 --> 04:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
patron actually reads the book or not
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
usually that's about 26 checkouts
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
at that point the library must either
 
04:19:42.030 --> 04:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
relinquish the title back to the
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
publisher or again shell out the same
 
04:19:45.000 --> 04:19:46.510 align:start position:0%
publisher or again shell out the same
exorbitant

04:19:46.510 --> 04:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
exorbitant
 
04:19:49.950 --> 04:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
fee by contrast libraries frequently
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
attain paper copies the way that youur I
 
04:19:56.429 --> 04:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
would do so through a local or online
 
04:19:59.950 --> 04:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
vendor at the going rate while binding
 
04:20:02.189 --> 04:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
for heavy use obviously increase the
 
04:20:04.830 --> 04:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
cost of the book a bit those binding
 
04:20:10.109 --> 04:20:10.119 align:start position:0%
fees are not the 4 100 to 1,00% increase
 
04:20:12.990 --> 04:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
that libraries experience with ebooks
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
and that binding fee isn't paid every
 
04:20:14.800 --> 04:20:15.630 align:start position:0%
and that binding fee isn't paid every
two

04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:20:19.469 --> 04:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
years to analogize the present ebook
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
system is the equivalent of the
 
04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
publisher entering a library and pulling
 
04:20:28.269 --> 04:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
the hard copy book off a shelf under the
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
threat that if the library doesn't pay
 
04:20:34.590 --> 04:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
for it again the publisher will seize
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
the already paid for title
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
now certainly if that happened the
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
public would be up in arms because the
 
04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
public owns that
 
04:20:50.189 --> 04:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
title and that bears
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
emphasizing we the taxpayers bear the
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
cost of this dysfunctional system we
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
bear the costs of paying the
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
Publishers estimates from the American
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
Library Association suggests public
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
libraries ebook costs have more than
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
doubled in the past 5 years and that
 
04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
cost is still
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
increasing moreover Library ebook costs
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
now outstrip hard copy cost by a 5:1
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
margin and that is also
 
04:21:27.389 --> 04:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
increasing our tax dollars are
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
increasingly spent to get
 
04:21:34.030 --> 04:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
less ultimately this is a clash between
 
04:21:36.109 --> 04:21:36.119 align:start position:0%
the profit driven model of private
 
04:21:36.119 --> 04:21:37.189 align:start position:0%
the profit driven model of private
publish

04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
publish
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
versus the public goods model of our
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
libraries which subsist on our tax
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
dollars when Publishers charge public
 
04:21:47.520 --> 04:21:49.550 align:start position:0%
dollars when Publishers charge public
institutions

04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
04:21:54.510 --> 04:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
1,00% more and require that 1,00% be
 
04:21:54.520 --> 04:21:55.670 align:start position:0%
1,00% more and require that 1,00% be
paid

04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
paid
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
repeatedly we each foot the bill and we
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
have little to show for it aside the
 
04:22:05.870 --> 04:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
same title over and over which is
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
available to others for far less now
 
04:22:12.389 --> 04:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
admittedly as is often the case on these
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
bills there are counterarguments to the
 
04:22:17.109 --> 04:22:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill otherwise we wouldn't even be here
 
04:22:19.710 --> 04:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
today A frequently asserted argument by
 
04:22:21.670 --> 04:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
Publishers is that authors bookstores
 
04:22:24.189 --> 04:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
and the Publishers themselves couldn't
 
04:22:27.070 --> 04:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
survive under the terms of this bill the
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
argument goes that if patrons could
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
simply borrow an ebook why would they
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
ever buy one the present practice
 
04:22:36.910 --> 04:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
preserves costs and profits
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
ludicrous libraries have existed for
 
04:22:43.149 --> 04:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
centuries and have always offered
 
04:22:46.389 --> 04:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
patrons a choice purchase the book or
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
borrow it from the library and despite
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
that so-called competition book sellers
 
04:22:55.030 --> 04:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
and authors have existed and will
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
continue to exist some people just
 
04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
prefer the convenience of owning a title
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
or wish to own a beloved
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
book additionally in 2002 a federal
 
04:23:09.189 --> 04:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
judge overturned a somewhat similar
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
Maryland law based on the federal
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
Supremacy power over copyright there is
 
04:23:14.960 --> 04:23:15.950 align:start position:0%
Supremacy power over copyright there is
a

04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:23:19.109 --> 04:23:19.119 align:start position:0%
substantial difference however between
 
04:23:22.349 --> 04:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
the Maryland law and the proposed Bill
 
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between copyright and
 
04:23:29.429 --> 04:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
contract namely the Maryland act sought
 
04:23:32.109 --> 04:23:32.119 align:start position:0%
to dictate the manner in which book
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%

electronic literary product arguably
 
04:23:46.469 --> 04:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
that might be a topic within the federal
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution's copyright Clause since it

says if you sell books you shall do this
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
but the present Bill regulates quote

04:24:06.269 --> 04:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
State jurisdiction because contract law
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
law is a traditional State
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
concern the difference is subtle but
 
04:24:15.950 --> 04:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
important one says if you sell books you
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
shall do this the other says if you
 
04:24:23.469 --> 04:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
contract with libraries in this state
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
this specific practice is unfair and
 
04:24:28.750 --> 04:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
deceptive it might be a slight
 
04:24:31.870 --> 04:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
difference but the shift from copyright
 
04:24:35.469 --> 04:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
to contract is important and as is so
 
04:24:39.109 --> 04:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
often the case in law Details
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
Matter I ask you don't be deterred by
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
the Doomsday arguments you may encounter
 
04:24:48.149 --> 04:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
our libraries in public deserve
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
Equitable terms to literary materials
 
04:24:54.070 --> 04:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
and do not deserve to be an industry's
 
04:24:54.080 --> 04:24:55.030 align:start position:0%
and do not deserve to be an industry's
Cash

04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
Cash
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
Cow though we might be in for a legal
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
battle from an industry eager to
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
preserve its profits at taxpayer expense
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has always been first and
 
04:25:09.630 --> 04:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
we will continue to lead the way I look
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
forward to your questions as we work to
 
04:25:13.189 --> 04:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
protect our libraries and granted
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
Staters wallets and with that I ask if
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:25:25.990 --> 04:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
Gallagher so
 
04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
um one
 
04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
um one case along these lines that I've
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
read about recently has been the case of
 
04:25:38.710 --> 04:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
um the internet archive
 
04:25:42.910 --> 04:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
um being in uh legal conflicts with
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
Publishers um so due to similar
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
contracts about ebooks um
 
04:25:54.389 --> 04:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
now I I'm wondering would this so would
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
this apply like just to local libraries
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
or say like what would the would would
 
04:26:03.269 --> 04:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
the internet archive for example be able
 
04:26:08.189 --> 04:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
to um make use of this law if they say
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in New Hampshire or um set
 
04:26:13.710 --> 04:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
up like some sort of physical location
 
04:26:15.750 --> 04:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
here something so thank you
 
04:26:17.229 --> 04:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
representative to my knowledge the
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
internet archive would not be under the
 
04:26:21.469 --> 04:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
scope of this law because it is not
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
Distributing ebooks and there's no fee
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
paid for the internet archive the
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
internet archive is a freely available
 
04:26:31.990 --> 04:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
resource of uh scholarly articles that
 
04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
have been posted online versus something
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
like uh the Sage portal which has a paid
 
04:26:40.670 --> 04:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
subscription service that libraries use
 
04:26:42.510 --> 04:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
to access
 
04:26:44.590 --> 04:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh scholarly
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
articles libraries would still have to
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
pay for ebooks they're just doing so on
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
inequitable basis uh this bill does
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
Define what libraries are as obviously
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
we need to Define what a library is and
 
04:26:58.590 --> 04:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
this bill does so it would include
 
04:26:58.600 --> 04:26:59.710 align:start position:0%
this bill does so it would include
research

04:26:59.710 --> 04:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
research
 
04:27:01.710 --> 04:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
institutions so they would still need to
 
04:27:03.550 --> 04:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
pay for ebooks but do so on an equitable
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
basis but I don't believe it would count
 
04:27:07.389 --> 04:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
research articles within it based on the
 
04:27:10.830 --> 04:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:15.109 --> 04:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you uh thank you for taking
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
the question it seems like the basis for
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
fairness however um if if Publishers
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
decided that um they were no longer
 
04:27:34.510 --> 04:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:27:38.109 --> 04:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:41.790 --> 04:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
their their uh ebooks Perpetual licenses
 
04:27:44.910 --> 04:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
if they they sold them decided to sell
 
04:27:47.109 --> 04:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
them for you know you can only read this
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
three times and then um that's that's
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
all that you're getting with this fee
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
would then um your qualms about the
 
04:28:01.710 --> 04:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
unfairness between the general public
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
and libraries be uh
 
04:28:04.840 --> 04:28:07.109 align:start position:0%
and libraries be uh
assuaged

04:28:07.109 --> 04:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
assuaged
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
it would certainly put the public and
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
libraries on an equal basis but I would
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
say that then both are being equally
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
treated equally unfairly indeed this is
 
04:28:16.830 --> 04:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
a bill about fairness Consumer
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
Protection Law is a matter of fairness
 
04:28:20.910 --> 04:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
which is a traditional State concern to
 
04:28:23.309 --> 04:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
protect its citizens in the matter of uh
 
04:28:23.319 --> 04:28:26.269 align:start position:0%
protect its citizens in the matter of uh
consumer

04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
affairs representative
 
04:28:31.510 --> 04:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:28:34.349 --> 04:28:34.359 align:start position:0%
representative for uh taking my question
 
04:28:36.269 --> 04:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
have you consulted with the the New
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public
 
04:28:39.990 --> 04:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
Library I've consulted with the New
 
04:28:41.590 --> 04:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Library and also my
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
public library in Keen about this uh and
 
04:28:45.149 --> 04:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
both have reflected the fact that they
 
04:28:47.590 --> 04:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
are paying an exorbitant amount of money
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
on ebooks and would support this type of
 
04:28:53.229 --> 04:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
04:28:56.750 --> 04:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
you represent stavis thank you Mr chair
 
04:28:58.590 --> 04:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
have you consulted with any University
 
04:29:03.750 --> 04:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
libraries in the state on this question
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
I've consulted with Keane State Library
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
who is indicated support for the bill uh
 
04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
we also see that uh public libraries
 
04:29:10.990 --> 04:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
from other states which have introduced
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
similar bills have supported because
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
similar to what we see in public
 
04:29:16.389 --> 04:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
libraries University libraries also get
 
04:29:19.389 --> 04:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
hit with these similar fees uh this
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
would also again allow for a better uh
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
access to inter Library loans since most
 
04:29:25.109 --> 04:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
libraries are part of the inter Library
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
Network this would allow for inter
 
04:29:28.950 --> 04:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
Library lending at a better or more
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
Equitable inter Library lending since if
 
04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
a library were to lend out a book
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
through IL that would count towards
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
their 26 not even giving it towards
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
their own patrons a followup question
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you Mr
 
04:29:41.520 --> 04:29:43.790 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you Mr
chair

04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
um you'll have to excuse me but but this
 
04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
is a committee that deals with the kind
 
04:29:54.109 --> 04:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
of nuts and bolts details of local
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal County
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
government um I'm struggling to find
 
04:30:04.830 --> 04:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
where where the contents of this bill
 
04:30:07.229 --> 04:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
fits into the workings of local and
 
04:30:07.239 --> 04:30:08.950 align:start position:0%
fits into the workings of local and
municipal

04:30:08.950 --> 04:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
government uh thank you for your
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
question I was also surprised to see
 
04:30:13.950 --> 04:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
that it was assigned to the committee
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
however I am not the speaker and don't
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
get to make those decisions it seems to
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
be a more natural fit for Commerce which
 
04:30:22.189 --> 04:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
is where it has gone uh in other states
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
would it's been there however our public
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
libraries are controlled by
 
04:30:28.870 --> 04:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and also receive
 
04:30:31.950 --> 04:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal dollars ultimately I would say
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
that this is not an issue of fairness
 
04:30:36.309 --> 04:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
but an issue of Municipal dollars we are
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
wasting Municipal dollars by paying
 
04:30:42.790 --> 04:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
exorbitant fees for ebooks and paying
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
those exorbitant fees repeatedly when
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
those books are available to Consumers
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
at a lesser rate and if those same
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
materials were purchased in paper they'd
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
be purchased for much less and
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
once representative kahill thank you Mr
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
good to see you again um did you consult
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
the Library Association did they have a
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
um an opinion on this the American
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
public the American Library Association
 
04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
I've not consulted them but they've been
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
supportive of the bill in other states
 
04:31:13.870 --> 04:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
this is also a revised version of the
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
bill from what was in 2022 in Maryland
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
to specifically taken out of the realm
 
04:31:22.590 --> 04:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
of copyright into the realm of uh
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
contract law and the American public
 
04:31:26.590 --> 04:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
Library Association is supportive of
 
04:31:32.189 --> 04:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
language representative
 
04:31:36.750 --> 04:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
majority thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh my
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
question goes right to Commerce but this
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
is here so I have to ask the question do
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
you have any idea how many different
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
companies are available for our
 
04:31:51.070 --> 04:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
libraries to purchase these and if any
 
04:31:53.550 --> 04:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
of those companies could just then say
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
no based on if this bill were to pass
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
and therefore leaving us in a in a
 
04:32:01.149 --> 04:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
without the ability to provide those
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
books to to my knowledge there are five
 
04:32:06.109 --> 04:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
major Publishers of consumer books um
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
and I actually one of them has already
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
said they don't want to offer ebooks in
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
general except for at a at a high rate
 
04:32:14.590 --> 04:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh the difficulty with the book industry
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
is that for example if Michael cden were
 
04:32:18.429 --> 04:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
to write a new book it would only be
 
04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
available through that publisher whereas
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
in other Municipal contracts we can go
 
04:32:25.870 --> 04:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
out and do a competitive bid that steel
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
is available through a number of of
 
04:32:29.710 --> 04:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
vendors or even for pharmaceuticals you
 
04:32:31.109 --> 04:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
can wait for a generic to come out there
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
will be no generic Michael Ken and that
 
04:32:36.269 --> 04:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
that is the difficulty here is that we
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
we do have to purchase it through this
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
vendor U so they could potentially pull
 
04:32:43.630 --> 04:32:43.640 align:start position:0%
it however litigation through press is a
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
very attractive means to say that we
 
04:32:47.710 --> 04:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
don't wish to contract with the state
 
04:32:50.229 --> 04:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
because we can't get our own way is very
 
04:32:52.349 --> 04:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
unattractive to a business and would
 
04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
become very unattractive very quickly
 
04:32:55.990 --> 04:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
boycotts have a way to sway companies
 
04:32:56.000 --> 04:32:58.389 align:start position:0%
boycotts have a way to sway companies
very

04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.189 --> 04:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
lales yes uh thank you for taking my
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
question you prefaced your comments by
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
saying that libraries are forced to pay
 
04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
a higher rate than the general
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
public if the general public wants a
 
04:33:22.230 --> 04:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
scholarly uh book why wouldn't they just
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
way typically what we're talking about
 
04:33:30.910 --> 04:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
with regards to ebooks are not scholarly
 
04:33:32.949 --> 04:33:32.959 align:start position:0%
books scholarly books do tend to cost
 
04:33:34.990 --> 04:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
more than your trade books so here we're
 
04:33:37.709 --> 04:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
talking more D Vinci Code than we are
 
04:33:37.719 --> 04:33:38.750 align:start position:0%
talking more D Vinci Code than we are
cell

04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
cell
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
biology uh if a consumer wanted to
 
04:33:43.990 --> 04:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
purchase that they would typically go
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
online and buy that however if a
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
consumer wanted to access a a scholarly
 
04:33:53.109 --> 04:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
book they may do so through a library
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
which may have it available for as an
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
eever and one of the primary reasons why
 
04:33:59.869 --> 04:33:59.879 align:start position:0%
they may do so is that they can't afford
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
it that we see for example the academic
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
libraries do have e versions of academic
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
books available because they are
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
expensive for your average student many
 
04:34:13.390 --> 04:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
of these books are now approaching $3
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
$400 that can be a lot for a struggling
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
student and this provides a means for
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
them to access needed academic materials
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
for for lust to be able to get the
 
04:34:23.750 --> 04:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
education they need without having to
 
04:34:25.990 --> 04:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
pay exorb anded publisher
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
fees thank you repr of kill thank you Mr
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
chair thank thank you for taking another
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
question do you do you see this
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
affecting the school libraries too um is
 
04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
are they under a different rate plan the
 
04:34:42.590 --> 04:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
the terms of the bill does include the
 
04:34:44.109 --> 04:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
school libraries however for example the
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
high school libraries do not use ebooks
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
to the same extent as do our public
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
libraries just as a just as an example
 
04:34:52.349 --> 04:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
the Keen Public Library which is my
 
04:34:55.629 --> 04:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
local library lent out 39,000 ebooks uh
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
last year alone which is more than one
 
04:35:00.189 --> 04:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
per per person uh you're certainly not
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
getting to that rate at the the Keen
 
04:35:04.949 --> 04:35:04.959 align:start position:0%
High School library um they are using
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
the more as there is a transition to
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
tablets in the classroom but we're
 
04:35:13.269 --> 04:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
much represent priest uh thank you for
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
being here um what are other states
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
doing about this and what are the
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
repercussions of their actions so we've
 
04:35:29.310 --> 04:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
seen about a dozen states bring this
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
forward right now with many of them
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
still in deliberation uh Maryland was
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
the first state to pass this and I said
 
04:35:37.709 --> 04:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
the uh the federal court did Strike It
 
04:35:40.429 --> 04:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
Down for violating the supremacy clause
 
04:35:42.510 --> 04:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
with regards to the federal contracts
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
Clause because the way that the bill was
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
worded that it prohibited the the sale
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
of books which is ostensibly a violation
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the federal contracts Clause that's
 
04:35:53.310 --> 04:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
debatable but that's the way that it
 
04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
went New York in the same year passed
 
04:35:59.230 --> 04:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
the same bill and out of fear of also
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
being struck down uh Governor hoel
 
04:36:03.910 --> 04:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
vetoed that bill deciding that they
 
04:36:06.029 --> 04:36:06.039 align:start position:0%
would rather do a redraft then go to
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
federal court and face the same fate
 
04:36:11.070 --> 04:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts right now uh has a bill
 
04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
that is very similar to this with slight
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
wording differences in committee we also
 
04:36:18.029 --> 04:36:18.039 align:start position:0%
see that uh our neighbors in uh RH
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
Island and Connecticut have a similar
 
04:36:23.310 --> 04:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
Bill uh Virginia has a bill in committee
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh Hawaii has a bill in committee as
 
04:36:27.269 --> 04:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
well as a handful of other states right
 
04:36:28.750 --> 04:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
now so we're starting to see a movement
 
04:36:28.760 --> 04:36:32.510 align:start position:0%
now so we're starting to see a movement
towards

04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
this followup rep yes please place a
 
04:36:38.949 --> 04:36:38.959 align:start position:0%
followup um so there hasn't been any
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
states that have been able to enact this
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
that has not been struck down as of yet
 
04:36:46.990 --> 04:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
no because it's a it's a relatively new
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
issue okay again 2022 was the first time
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
that such a bill was passed and
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was struck down by the
 
04:36:58.670 --> 04:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:01.310 --> 04:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
away representative
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
yella thank you so um it seems
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
like your
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
um your position uh based on on prior
 
04:37:18.029 --> 04:37:18.039 align:start position:0%
questions is that um if the um the
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
Publishers decide that this is is
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
unworkable but they are not required to
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
um have uh any offerings to libraries
 
04:37:31.590 --> 04:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
for ebook ebook
 
04:37:35.830 --> 04:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
purchases um as a way to avoid
 
04:37:40.029 --> 04:37:40.039 align:start position:0%
uh avoid the ramifications of this to be
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
fair representative the Publishers
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
already aren't required to sell to the
 
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.789 --> 04:37:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
questions I have one based on that last
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
answer Publishers are not required to
 
04:38:05.269 --> 04:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
sell ebooks to libraries is that what
 
04:38:08.670 --> 04:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
you meant a private company is not
 
04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
required to sell a product to anybody
 
04:38:13.150 --> 04:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
that's been The Stance of the Supreme
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
um Can the uh can a library go down to
 
04:38:28.830 --> 04:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh local bookstore or online or whatever
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
and buy a hard copy paperback is there
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
anything that prevents that from
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
occurring yes so as I mentioned in my my
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
my opening remarks for paper copies that
 
04:38:40.349 --> 04:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
is what book or excuse me libraries do
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
that if they want to buy a paper copy
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
they will typically go on to Amazon get
 
04:38:47.310 --> 04:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
that put it into uh special binding for
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
the repeated use and it cost about as
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
much as we would purchas something on

Amazon 4 plus the additional binding fee
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
it is only for the ebooks where they are
 
04:38:59.310 --> 04:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
locked up into the Monopoly that the
 
04:39:02.709 --> 04:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
Publishers have right now thank you

representative yo thank you kind of
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
going back to representative Galler's uh
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
question about the internet AR archive
 
04:39:17.830 --> 04:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
since they do have books on there and in
 
04:39:23.590 --> 04:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
on line six te you uh define archive as
 
04:39:28.990 --> 04:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
a library and so I'm just wondering
 
04:39:31.709 --> 04:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
um can you clarify why you believe that
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
the internet archive would not be um
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
qualified under this if if they are
 
04:39:39.628 --> 04:39:39.638 align:start position:0%
indeed an archive because the law can't
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.350 --> 04:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
effect the internet Li the internet
 
04:39:48.788 --> 04:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
archive doesn't exist in New Hampshire
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:56.190 --> 04:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire further
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
04:40:00.670 --> 04:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
introducing Bill and your commentary
 
04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you committee we have

tend to speak on this make sure you have
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.510 --> 04:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
Stewart and missart as I have been

little LAX in reminding people could you
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
please State at the beginning whether
 
04:40:24.830 --> 04:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
you are for against or neutral on the
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:31.628 --> 04:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
you is that on okay my name is Mary
 
04:40:33.310 --> 04:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
Stewart I'm an assistant attorney
 
04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
general for the consumer consum
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust Bureau at the
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office we are not
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
here to support or oppose the bill but
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
to point out a concern regarding
 
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement only so I uh would direct
 
04:40:54.030 --> 04:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
your attention to the third page which
 
04:40:56.550 --> 04:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
is section 202
 
04:40:59.910 --> 04:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
C3 which is remedies violation of the
 
04:41:01.708 --> 04:41:01.718 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act and there's
 
04:41:04.750 --> 04:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
three sentences uh the first one of
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
violation in this chapter is considered
 
04:41:08.150 --> 04:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
to be a violation of the consumer
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
protection act 358a and all remedies and
 
04:41:11.680 --> 04:41:12.670 align:start position:0%
protection act 358a and all remedies and
consumer

04:41:12.670 --> 04:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
protection act are available for such
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
violations that's fine our concern is
 
04:41:22.750 --> 04:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
the second sentence which says actions
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
May BR be brought by libraries Library
 
04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
officers borrowers the attorney general
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
and then it says or pursuant to RSA 358
 
04:41:33.638 --> 04:41:35.470 align:start position:0%
and then it says or pursuant to RSA 358
A4

04:41:35.470 --> 04:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
A4
 
04:41:38.830 --> 04:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
um so our concern is is that the
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
reference to 358 A4 could arguably be
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
granting um administrative enforcement
 
04:41:49.150 --> 04:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
authority to private parties which
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
historically has never happen in this
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
type of situation typically so the
 
04:41:57.550 --> 04:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act has two remedy
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
Provisions one is 358 A4 which are the
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
administrative remedies that are
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
typically enforced by the Consumer
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau those in include
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
injunctions uh civil
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
penalties um restitution and the ability
 
04:42:18.030 --> 04:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
to request the court to appoint a
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
receiver and then there is a private
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
remedy section which is 358 A10 and uh
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
private parties can also Sue under the
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act they can receive
 
04:42:33.150 --> 04:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
damages either actual or $1,000
 
04:42:36.670 --> 04:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
statutory damages equable relief like an
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
injunction um and if the ACT is
 
04:42:40.750 --> 04:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
intentional they can get double or
 
04:42:46.070 --> 04:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
treble damages so our our only concern
 
04:42:49.948 --> 04:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
is that reference to 358 A4 should
 
04:42:54.270 --> 04:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
not um to not Grant to private citizens
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:03.480 --> 04:43:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:43:06.070 --> 04:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
are there
 
04:43:09.310 --> 04:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
questions you look like you have a
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:43:14.110 --> 04:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
yella I'm surprised representative power
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't uh tear this sentence to
 
04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
shreds with with grammar so um the um
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
the Oxford comma usage uh in this um
 
04:43:30.030 --> 04:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
there's like borrows borrowers the
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney General um is just run on right
 
04:43:38.830 --> 04:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
correct and so that also is a problem
 
04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
so is that you you agree with that yeah
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
I agree there seems to be some
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
commas you know and missing in this
 
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
yes should be actions may be brought by
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
libraries it says actions May brought by
 
04:43:59.430 --> 04:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
libraries we'll acknowledge that there
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
are issues with the com sentence missing
 
04:44:04.510 --> 04:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
words further comments or questions uh
 
04:44:07.190 --> 04:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Brown thank you
 
04:44:12.310 --> 04:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman U so in regard to RSA 358
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
A4 the only objection you really have to
 
04:44:16.708 --> 04:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
this is excuse me the only objection you
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
really have to this is that the the
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
incorrect enforcement if this bill was
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
passed the way it is without that
 
04:44:24.750 --> 04:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
reference then the Attorney General
 
04:44:27.670 --> 04:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
could have enforced this based on being
 
04:44:29.830 --> 04:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
the state as opposed to individuals is
 
04:44:32.110 --> 04:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
that the point you were making yeah what
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
the it what it is intending to do is to
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
say violation is of of this bill or this
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
statute is a violation the consumer
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
protection act and the Attorney General
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
can enforce that and and would be able
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
to do that under the language of the
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
spill Our concern is and as could
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
private citizens so our only concern is
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
is that we don't want private citizens
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
to have administrative enforcement
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
Authority as well so it's just the it's
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
phrased thank you very much
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
okay further comments question uh
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:45:14.430 --> 04:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
04:45:16.990 --> 04:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
04:45:21.788 --> 04:45:21.798 align:start position:0%
you having no other pink cards uh we had
 
04:45:25.590 --> 04:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
two individuals sign in the the
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative philio
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
who was Pro and Shelly husband who was
 
04:45:36.310 --> 04:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:38.510 --> 04:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay so with that we'll close the
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
04:45:40.680 --> 04:45:42.590 align:start position:0%
hearing on
HB

04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
HB
 
04:45:42.600 --> 04:45:44.868 align:start position:0%
HB
1342

04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
1342
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
FN so it looks like we are complete for
 
04:45:50.910 --> 04:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
the day we had originally one other Bill
 
04:45:54.948 --> 04:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
scheduled but that one the sponsor
 
04:45:58.750 --> 04:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
pulled and retracted completely so we
 
04:46:01.948 --> 04:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
are don't have that one to go on uh next
 
04:46:03.948 --> 04:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
date as I spoke at the beginning for
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
those who weren't here we will meet I'll
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
go over the dates again for January we
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
will meet next Wednesday the
 
04:46:17.788 --> 04:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
17th the following Wednesday the
 
04:46:22.830 --> 04:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
30th and there's a possibility we may
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
throw in an extra day towards the end of
 
04:46:29.788 --> 04:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
the two two weeks where we may do some
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
exing but that's undecided at this point
 
04:46:34.628 --> 04:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%

04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
calendar route yet yeah I think I saw it
 
04:46:46.750 --> 04:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
it should was it in well we we got a
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
notice I think it'll be in the calendar
 
04:46:52.350 --> 04:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
this Thursday ex follow then at some
 
04:46:54.030 --> 04:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
point at some point okay thank you
 
04:46:55.708 --> 04:46:55.718 align:start position:0%
haven't got I haven't scheduled those
 
04:46:58.910 --> 04:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
yet represent PRI thank you Mr chairman
 
04:47:00.270 --> 04:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
I have a point of
 
04:47:02.548 --> 04:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
clarification um there were several
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
bills today that might have some
 
04:47:10.270 --> 04:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
amendments and I guess we will be using
 
04:47:14.430 --> 04:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
our exact time to go over the Amendments
 
04:47:16.670 --> 04:47:16.680 align:start position:0%

exec to go over any amendments what I
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
would hope to see is the couple of bills

that we're talking about amendments that
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
those amendments would be

done by the
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
