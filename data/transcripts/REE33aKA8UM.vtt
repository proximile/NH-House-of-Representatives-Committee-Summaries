business I believe we have a couple uh
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
items on
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
informational and I believe we also have
 
00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
another guest that would like to speak

commissioner uh environmental
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
services and uh I'm excited to read what
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
you had submitted and if you have a few
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
it uh good morning uh so uh I I'll
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
briefly speak but I have uh our
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
assistant Commissioner Adam crepo and
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
Phil trobridge who uh is leading our our
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
charge on uh some of our database
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
efforts uh but uh as we presented last
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
time uh we're pleased to be able to make
 
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
progress uh on the uh the uh both uh our
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
internal but also probably more
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
importantly our external uh database
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
work uh to help serve our constituents
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
so uh we're pleased with the the funds
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
we've been able to get uh from the
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
legislature and arpa uh and uh we uh we
 
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
feel we're making the best use of those
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
possible and we hope you agree so if
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's all right with you I'm probably
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
not going to ask them to sit in the same
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
chair but uh maybe the the Phil and Adam
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
you good morning thanks for having us
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
this morning um so in October as you
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned chairman uh we submitted some
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
updates on our technology projects um we
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
you know we're here today to provide you
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
know brief explanation some and take
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
some questions uh before I dive into
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
specifics I just I thought it would be
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
helpful to let you know we have two
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
capital appropri ations and one from
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
arpa um and so throughout all of these
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
projects we've been trying to spend the
 
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
arpa funding down first as many of you
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
know the deadlines around arpa um it
 
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be obligated by the end of this
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
year and spent by the end of 2026 and so
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more of a of a
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
pressing deadline for for those funds um
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know as as most of you know
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
historically for most permit
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
applications we've had to applicants had
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
to file paper forms and um and we're
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
using these these Appropriations from
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
arpa and Capitol really to to make
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
transformational progress on getting our
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
forms in our land resources management
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh section online and so that includes
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain um Shoreland
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
subsurface as as you know chairman and
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh Wetlands so
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
since January we've we've received
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
nearly 3,000 total submissions online uh
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
We've made a lot of progress over the
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
last year uh like I said a year ago we
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
didn't have any forms uh in those
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
programs online and uh we've gotten all
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
of wetlands and all of shorland which
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
accepts the most applications uh by far
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
in in the Department of Environmental
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
Services from from per uh permites so
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's a huge
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishment there um but what we're
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
also planning to do and that's it's
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's through enform um it's a windsor
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
Solutions product and so what we're
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
doing next is we're working with Windsor
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
on a on another uh project to this is
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
really eiling and bringing e permitting
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
online which is being basically being
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
able to file everything with without
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
really having the submit PDFs except for
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
plans and things like that uh right now
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
they're able to submit a PDF of their
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
application and some some you know basic
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
information in the in the form of you
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
know name address phone number those
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing currently um and so
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're expecting to do that over
 
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
the next two two or three years to get
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
to get all of those um online and what
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
that will also do is um replace all of
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
our Legacy databases and so we have a
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
lot of Legacy databases in lrm uh that
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
that will
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
basically take us from having to accept
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
those online and enter them in uh on the
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
back end to allowing someone to submit
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
something online and have that go right
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
straight into the database and um it it
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
really creates creates efficiencies for
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
us on the back end but also for the
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
applicant on the front end and and
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh reduce reduce turnaround
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
times um the next effort I'd like to
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
just give a quick update on is our
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
subsurface digitization efforts um we
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
we are digitizing around 4 million uh
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
old subsurface files those are all of
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
our septic um historic sep septic
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
records uh from 1967 until around 2015
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
2015 we started to to do things uh you
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
know in the 21st century so um you know
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
we're about 15% through that total
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
project um and it's really helping
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
constituents already we've we've gotten
 
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of feedback Rec especially
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
recently that folks are using this data
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
to see you know what how old their
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
septic system is and and historically
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
they've had to call in and staff have
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
had to actually go physically find the
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
find the folder or the the box that it's
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
sitting in and whether it's in a
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
warehouse or physically at 29 Hazen
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
Drive where we are and uh and sip
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
through those and so this will create
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
some efficiencies there as well as
 
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
allowing ease for the public to actually
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
go online and find this stuff when when
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
they're uh whether it's a real estate
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
transaction or or they're developing a
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
new property um so with that I mean
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
those are those are really the the major
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
updates since uh I believe the last time
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
we spoke was in in June um but but happy
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%

resources management section that um Can
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
details as well thank you commission
 
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.430 align:start position:0%
details as well thank you commission
crpo

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
crpo
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
questions I have a couple I missed a
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
point when you were speaking did you say
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
the majority the you have the higher
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of your applications
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
or Shoreland is that what you said
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
Shoreland and wetlands yeah um th that's
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
by far the most applications we receive
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
in the department it's in the thousands
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
um roughly 3,000 I
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
believe okay it's and subsurfaces how
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
many subsurface 6000 6,000 subsurface
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay if I if I could follow up you
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind so um this whole process
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
is phenomenal the um um personally we
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
file a lot of shorel a lot of uh
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
subsurface applications but it's really
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
exciting the shorelands moving forward
 
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759 align:start position:0%
that's tremendous a lot less trips to
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
the printer for me to generate plans to
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
send them to you um has there been
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
energy and and perhaps Phil I should be
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
speaking to him has there been energy to
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
expand the uh limits on the shorel by
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
the pbn process I I've seen people
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
getting much more comfortable with this
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a finite 900 square
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
feet for a new structure is there is
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
there an effort to Ink that up some get
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
us up another 10 15% I'll I'll uh let
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
Bill come up and speak to that if if
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%

so we are looking at all those rules in
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
terms and any kind of streamlining we
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
can do with the the by notification
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
process we'll by all means do uh we're
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
doing a lot more of that with the
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
Wetland side we're doing a big uh push
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
on the Wetland rules right now uh and
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
try and uh have more permit by
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
notifications and also just a more
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
streamlined process overall thank you

for that is there a conversation ongoing
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
conversation about increasing the
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
thresholds a legitimate conference
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
happening on that
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
conversation from 900 square feet to a
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
higher number and 1500 to 1,800 or some
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there uh we haven't been
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%

questions you can go to questions I sure
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
because well I don't know if Chris
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
explained um I apologize I thought
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
I was filling out corer reports for uh
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
Das and um there was some confusion I
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
thought that was the quarter of the
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
report that came here Chris yes so as
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
you might recall last meeting I had
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
indicated that the Community College had
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
been providing information as part of
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
the report that dis collects on capital
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
projects however in the capital budget
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
the committee the legislature had asked
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
for more specific details on the items
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
related to the critical maintenance and
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
the it work at the uh community college
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
so they are following up but it was just
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
an oversight it wasn't an intentional um
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know disregard for what the note
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
said that the Community College thought
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
they metant what was being asked for
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
after talking with them they agreed that
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
they could provide this report it would
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
be better to meet the language thank you
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%

the Federal Railroad administration's
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
Chrissy grant program New Hampshire do
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
was a big part of us being successful in
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
this round of Grants by providing
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
$500,000 in matching funds um over the
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
years the the Committees especially
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
Public Works has
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
supported uh kind of buying this one
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
piece at a time over many years I've
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
been around this railroad since the
 
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
mid90s and we've been replacing the
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
older rail with a heavier rail to get up
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
to the modern 286,000 PB rail car
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
standard for North America and with this
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
matching funds of
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
$500,000 we were able to get a u a
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
project worth 19.5 million with some
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
matching funds from Main
 
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
do uh the railroad and the Federal
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
Railroad Administration so this is
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
really a big deal um we're able to get a
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
notice proceed from the Federal Railroad
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
Administration go actually buy the rail
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
which we bought this year this summer we
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
we dropped the rail it's on the ground
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
in Coos County U we've got to get our
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
agreements in place we've got the draft
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
agreement from New Hampshire do right
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
now we're going over we have to get an
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
agreement with the Federal Railroad
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
Administration as well but our plans are
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
to install this rail next year along
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
with some switches uh a couple of grade
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
Crossings some ancillary supporting work
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
so this is a big deal for this railroad
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's been in the works for many
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
years uh a big collaboration between New
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Maine and Vermont to get this
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
done and uh that's my
