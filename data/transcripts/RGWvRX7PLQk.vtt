good morning everyone those of you
 
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
watching at home may be wondering
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
why this meeting hasn't started it being
 
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
a rainy day and a Monday we seem to be
 
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 align:start position:0%
lagging in attendance somewhat so we're
 
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
going to wait a few minutes to see if we
 
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
get a little more attendance plus we're
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
waiting on an amendment from OLS both of
 
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
those things
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
will cause us to have to wait a little
 
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
while before we get started
 
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
I'll try to keep you up to date as
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
that is the hold up this morning and we
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
the sun is out so it's no longer a rainy
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
day and a Monday it's still a Monday but
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%

going on this this morning I want to
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
outline what the day will look like
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%

subcommittee the SB 54 subcommittee to
 
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:02.940 align:start position:0%

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.630 align:start position:0%
vote on its recommendation to the full
committee

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
after we take that vote we will then
 
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.529 align:start position:0%
after we take that vote we will then
open

00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
a full committee work session on
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee's recommendation which
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
includes a significant Amendment
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss that Amendment as long as
 
00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:25.010 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss that Amendment as long as
necessary

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
once we've exhausted our comments and
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
end the full committee work session
 
00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:36.230 align:start position:0%
end the full committee work session
and

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
conclude our mornings work
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
then we'll come back here at two o'clock
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
this afternoon for an executive session
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill 54.
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
both the majority caucus and the
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
minority caucus will probably have
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
I know that's true of the majority
 
00:25:57.539 --> 00:25:59.630 align:start position:0%
I know that's true of the majority
carcass

00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
carcass
 
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
so this room will be unavailable
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
starting at one o'clock
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
until about
 
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
130 maybe 20 minutes of two
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
so with that as as way of by way of
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
background we can now begin the formal
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
activity of the day
 
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
and as chair of the SB 54 subcommittee
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call for a vote
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee members
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
on a recommendation to the full
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee that we passed Senate bill 54.
 
00:26:44.649 --> 00:26:44.659 align:start position:0%
by adopting Amendment
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
and I would ask are there any is there a
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
need for any further discussion from the
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I don't see that uh Amendment
 
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
here you passed it out right
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
you didn't get a copy oh it does have
 
00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:17.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
1580h is the
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a full discussion on
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
the amendment in a moment
 
00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:27.110 align:start position:0%
the amendment in a moment
um

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
I I have a question that representative
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
muns brought up to me
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
um on
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
it's section
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
eight in the old Amendment and I'm not
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
sure let me see if I can find it here
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's in this section
 
00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.830 align:start position:0%
it's in this section
on

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
um for the purpose of this section new
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
electric energy sources are those that
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
are able to provide additional energy to
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
the iso New England regional market
 
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
and the date in there is January 1st
 
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.789 align:start position:0%
and the date in there is January 1st
2023

00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:56.510 align:start position:0%
2023
um

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
and that there are energy sources that
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
existed prior to January 1st 2023 and
 
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
the question is why it set
 
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.149 align:start position:0%
the question is why it set
um

00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the past and why it wouldn't be set
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
for say 2025 to be starting in the
 
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.690 align:start position:0%
for say 2025 to be starting in the
future

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about line 16 on page
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
yeah it starts on 16. ends on 19. yep
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
all right I would suggest that since
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative munz is a member of the
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
full committee but not a member of the
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that we take up his
 
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.529 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that we take up his
question

00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
when we begin the full committee work
 
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
session would that be acceptable
 
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.970 align:start position:0%
session would that be acceptable
yeah

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion then
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee members
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be slightly pedantic if
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge my pedanticism for a
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
moment I'm looking at page two line
 
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.169 align:start position:0%
moment I'm looking at page two line
eight

00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:01.850 align:start position:0%
eight
and

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
the word only is misplaced in that
 
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.590 align:start position:0%
the word only is misplaced in that
sentence

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
because the word only modifies what
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
should modify only what immediately
 
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
follows it
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
so I'd really like to see the word only
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
moved from where it is to to be between
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
the words for and up so it would say
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
we'll be eligible for approval for only
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
up to a total not to exceed
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
that would be more precise language and
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
since this is legal language it should
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
that suggestion I'm trying to evaluate
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
whether I think it's
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.610 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:03.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
right now the the word only is uh the
 
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
second word on the line says will only
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
be eligible which
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
based on the true meaning of of only and
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
where it is in the sentence this is
 
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
there's only one thing about the
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
agreements that are true and it's this
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
eligible nothing else about the
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
agreements is true
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm suggesting that it be moved to
 
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
between the words four and up so it'd be
 
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
will be eligible for approval for only
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
up to so that we're actually restricting
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
the right thing which is the amount of
 
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.649 align:start position:0%
the right thing which is the amount of
power

00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
I used to teach writing I used to direct
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
the writing program at Dartmouth so I I
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
get pedantic about these things but you
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
know because this is legal language we
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
should be getting it right
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
so you are correct this is a split
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
infinitive in in language terms and it's
 
00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
a common split infinitive
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that we need to make a
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
change it seems to me that it's not
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's not vague it may not be precise in
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
terms of legal language but as I said
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'm being pedantic but you know I I do
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
like to get these things right okay
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
well if we decide that we need to make
 
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
other changes maybe we'll make that one
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
the chair may ask for clarification yes
 
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.070 align:start position:0%
the chair may ask for clarification yes
so

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
on the interpretation going back to the
 
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.810 align:start position:0%
on the interpretation going back to the
pedantics

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:34.820 align:start position:0%
pedantics
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
on the interpretation would
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
could one be could the prior the way it
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
is currently will only be eligible for
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
approval for up to a total not to exceed
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
could that be
 
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.250 align:start position:0%
could that be
um

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
interpreted differently than the
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
language that you're suggesting in terms
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
so that question is for representative
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it it could be right because
 
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
we're saying agreements will only be
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
eligible you know Etc
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
so you know only modifies what
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
immediately follows it so what we're
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
there's only one thing about the
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
agreements that's true and it's that
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for approval blah blah
 
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:25.909 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for approval blah blah
blah

00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
blah
 
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
and nothing else about the agreements is
 
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.970 align:start position:0%
and nothing else about the agreements is
okay

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
we're restricting the agreements to only
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
being eligible for approval and nothing
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
else about the agreements is okay the
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
only thing that they're allowed to do is
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
be eligible for approval up to 2 million
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
whereas what we really want to be
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
restricting isn't everything about the
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
so doesn't that come back to what the
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the sentence is yeah and it
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
starts with collectively among all
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
investor-owned electric distribution
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
utilities so collectively agreements
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
will be eligible for approval for only
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
up to
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
that's right a total not to exceed right
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's it's
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
it more clearly states the intent right
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
if it's edited right yeah I would agree
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
right and again you know again I admit
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm being pedantic but and and I agree
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
with our our chair if we make further
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
changes that would be a good change to
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
make if we're not making further changes
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
might not be worth it
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
okay I appreciate that
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
further comments from the subcommittee
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the question of whether we're going
 
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
to prop propose to the full committee
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gorman thank you Mr
 
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.250 align:start position:0%
representative Gorman thank you Mr
chairman

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
um I actually want to revisit something
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
I brought up last week and that is on
 
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
lines again page two lines 16 through
 
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.049 align:start position:0%
lines again page two lines 16 through
18.

00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
18.
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
what incremental electric energy sources
 
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.830 align:start position:0%
what incremental electric energy sources
are

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
because the way the wording is right now
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
it says that they are those that existed
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
prior to January 1 2023
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
and which as a result of new
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
construction are capable of providing
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
additional energy into the iso New
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
England regional market on or after
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
the way I read that I I see that you
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
could have a power generator that
 
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
existed before January 123.
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
let's say just to make some numbers it's
 
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
producing 100 megawatts
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
and then it's added on to after January
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
123 let's say it's another 10 megawatts
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
again just to make numbers
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
the way I interpret this the entire 110
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
megawatts would be
 
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.770 align:start position:0%
megawatts would be
eligible

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
right because the the
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
Source existed before January 1 as a
 
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
result of new construction it is capable
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
of providing additional energy
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the 110. it's not the
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
incremental part it's it's the
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
additional energy I think that's the
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
intention here
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:27.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
yes I I mean I have read this and and I
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have that concern I see it's
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
only the 10 not the the hundred that it
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
would be eligible because
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh it is the are capable of providing
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
additional energy so it's the additional
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's relevant that's how I read it but
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
I I understand how you can interpret it
 
00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:01.390 align:start position:0%
I I understand how you can interpret it
differently

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
what would you do to rewrite this
 
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
well we actually did get suggested
 
00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
well we actually did get suggested
wording

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.109 align:start position:0%
wording
um

00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
and let me find that
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh so we could say incremental electric
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
energy sources are the new and
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
additional resources which as a result
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
of new construction at sites where
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
energy facilities existed prior to
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
January 1 2023 are able to be provided
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
into the iso New England regional market
 
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:37.700 align:start position:0%
for the first time on or after January 1
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
2023. so it's the new and additional
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
resources part that I think is relevant
 
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:48.849 align:start position:0%
resources part that I think is relevant
here

00:36:48.849 --> 00:36:48.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
maybe it's as simple as putting in
 
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
another sentence that says incremental
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh energy resources shall be limited to
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
the new the whatever we've got here is
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
new new resources and not previously uh
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
built ones or whatever something like
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
that I think it needs to be changed it's
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
too easy I mean but when you see Brooke
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
as an example they put out 1200
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
megawatts it would not take a hell of a
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
lot for him to put out 1205 megawatts
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
and then if someone could read this to
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
say all of that then would be eligible
 
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
and I think it needs to be clarified
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
because uh I mean it's just it's
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
okay this does seem like a legitimate
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
issue to
 
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:44.810 align:start position:0%
issue to
consider

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman maybe it's as simple as
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
saying only the additional energy
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
provided to the iso regional market will
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the contract
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
only the additional incremental energy
 
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.069 align:start position:0%
only the additional incremental energy
sources

00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
would be so eligible
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
only the additional incremental energy
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
well we're talking about the interim
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
incremental Electric
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I I think the section is
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
defining what incremental
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
or new electric energy sources including
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
incremental means right
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
so what I think what you're suggesting
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
or what representative Harrington
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
suggested about adding a sentence to say
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
contracts will be limited to new and
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
additional electrical resources added to
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
the New England the iso New England
 
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
regional market that kind of thing like
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
a clarifying statement on the end
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
is more about the contract piece whereas
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
the I think the letter B is actually
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
just trying to Define what we mean by
 
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
new and incremental so
 
00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:47.099 align:start position:0%
are we going to now try and do both in
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
that section
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
which I I don't I don't have any problem
 
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
with I'm just saying
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
um if we Define it properly we may not
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
need to say the other part no you're
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
right the whole purpose of this
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph As the first sentence stage
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
says for the purposes of this section
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
new electric energy sources
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
are and then
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
incremental electric energy sources are
 
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
so it's the purpose of this paragraph is
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
to design what those Define what those
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
two things are
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
so you're right
 
00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:22.490 align:start position:0%
so you're right
um

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is just clarify the
 
00:40:24.599 --> 00:40:27.650 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is just clarify the
definition

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
but I can give you the suggested wording
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
again if you'd like to hear it okay go
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
ahead okay so it would be incremental
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
electric energy sources
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
are the new and additional resources
 
00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.109 align:start position:0%
are the new and additional resources
comma

00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
comma
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
which as a result of new construction at
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
sites where energy facilities existed
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
prior to January 1 2023
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
comma are able to be provided into the
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
iso any regional market
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
for the first time on or after January 1
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
2023 and now I said that a little faster
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
than you you did right yeah I couldn't
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
John would you turn on your microphone
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay it's on representative Colon's
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
computer and he could just uh blast it
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
off to all of us yeah I mean I could
 
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
why don't you do that we'll do send a
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
quick email to all of us and we'll
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
while representative Corman is doing
 
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.750 align:start position:0%
while representative Corman is doing
that

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
does anybody else on the subcommittee
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi you okay with
 
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.370 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi you okay with
everything

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking I'm trying to contrast
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
you'll have to forgive the quiet while
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes there are other copies around
 
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:57.849 align:start position:0%
yes there are other copies around
somewhere

00:42:57.849 --> 00:42:57.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair on page three line 15 letter B
 
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
this time it actually is a b because my
 
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.050 align:start position:0%
this time it actually is a b because my
eyes

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
eyes
 
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:06.829 align:start position:0%
eyes
um

00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sure yeah
 
00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:17.569 align:start position:0%
I'm sure yeah
um

00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming since the one before it's
 
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
an a not a g
 
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
um it says credit or charge all
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
distribution rate payers
 
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.849 align:start position:0%
distribution rate payers
um

00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
should we modify that to say of the
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
Contracting utility so that it's a
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
it's specific to distribution rate
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
payers of the per the group that's
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
creating the PPA is that a modification
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
maybe should have in language I don't
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
think so because the the paragraph
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
starting on line eight
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
specifically points out that
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
requires the electric distribution
 
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.430 align:start position:0%
requires the electric distribution
utility

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
utility
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
to take these actions
 
00:44:06.599 --> 00:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
to take these actions
so

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
you think it's covered is that what
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
well when it says all distribution rate
 
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.270 align:start position:0%
well when it says all distribution rate
payers

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
payers
 
00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:41.060 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't say of that company or of
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
the Contracting utility then wouldn't
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
that legally maybe include all people
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
who are paying distribution charges I
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
mean there probably wouldn't be any way
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
contractually to
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
charge them but it wouldn't be excluded
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
or precluded with the language that's
 
00:44:56.579 --> 00:44:59.930 align:start position:0%
or precluded with the language that's
here

00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman maybe go ahead
 
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington is just adding
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
it there credit or charge all their
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
distribution rate payers and then it
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
would be clear that you're talking about
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
the electric distribution utility that's
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
mentioned above
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
we just had that word I think that would
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative McGee can you tell us
 
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
does this amendment
 
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
repo what does this amendment replace in
 
00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:47.099 align:start position:0%
the existing bill
 
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay it appears to be that yeah it's
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's an entire replace however
 
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.490 align:start position:0%
it's an entire replace however
um

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
I have a copy of what was submitted to
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
OLS in terms of the bolded sections that
 
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
were adopted by the various stakeholders
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
who presented language to us for
 
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.589 align:start position:0%
who presented language to us for
consideration

00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
so the first section uh that was changed
 
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:27.050 align:start position:0%
so the first section uh that was changed
was

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
I don't have the same number so it'll be
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
I have to
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you the right place so
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:52.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
of the amendment yeah
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for it the numbers are
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
different so it's going to make it even
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
more challenging
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's the section that starts electric
 
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's not it this is a lot harder than
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's the electric distribution utilities
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
shall consult with the Department of
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
energy and the office of the consumer
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
Advocate on all issues related to such
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
page one line 27. that's right yep it is
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
so after the word
 
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:59.809 align:start position:0%
so after the word
proposals

00:47:59.809 --> 00:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
the added part is from line 19 the
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
department in the office of the consumer
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
Advocate shall provide any such
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
consultation within 60 days from the
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
date each draft request for proposals is
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
provided for its review within this
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
period the utilities May solicit public
 
00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.309 align:start position:0%
period the utilities May solicit public
comment

00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I thought we had changed that to
 
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
Shell but
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
it somehow still says May
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
yeah my copy says shell and they
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
they put it in as May so I'm not sure
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
what happened there
 
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
but that was where we thought the public
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
comment would be appropriate
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
so I would like to see that be shall on
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
line 21 rather than May
 
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
and then the next section
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
of energy May hire Consultants to Aid in
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
the development of requests for
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
proposals and assess the costs of such
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
Consultants to the relevant distribution
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
electric utility or utilities as
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate and Equitable on a
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis the department shall
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
not enter into any contract under this
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
section in an amount greater than ten
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars including the any
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
contract extension without the approval
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
and then section e
 
00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:23.630 align:start position:0%
and then section e
um

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
section section e was also a bolded
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
section that we sent for inclusion which
 
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
was electric distribution utilities
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
shall engage and independent third party
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
to create appropriate requests for
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
proposal and to perform cost-benefit
 
00:49:41.329 --> 00:49:41.339 align:start position:0%
analysis of any agreement received
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
in response to the request for proposals
 
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
such analysis shall be provided to the
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
commission as part of the utilities
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
petition for approval of any purchase
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
power agreement resulting from the RFP
 
00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:57.290 align:start position:0%
power agreement resulting from the RFP
process

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
so section two of the Bill of the
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
amendment is this basically the
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill because section
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
one was just fine that's correct yep
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
so I have a question about those two
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
paragraphs go ahead um so
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
the with the wording that representative
 
00:50:16.319 --> 00:50:18.109 align:start position:0%
the with the wording that representative
McGee

00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
McGee
 
00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:20.870 align:start position:0%
McGee
suggests

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
um it's that the
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh where am I here the the department of
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
energy May hire Consultants
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
but the electric distribution utilities
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
shall engage an independent third party
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
right right so is that what what we
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
really intend here that that the
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
utilities have to have an independent
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
third party
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
yeah we had the conversation
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
um last Monday okay about what it means
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
to have someone other than the utilities
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
doing their own
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
um review and also
 
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.770 align:start position:0%
um review and also
um

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
the idea that that person would be
 
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
providing an objective cost-benefit
 
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
analysis that would be used by the puc
 
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's in later language so
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think there was agreement that
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
that would be a good thing
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
that is my memory okay
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
with regard to your suggestion that on
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
where it says the utilities May solicit
 
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
public comment I think you suggested
 
00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.089 align:start position:0%
public comment I think you suggested
that

00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
that should be changed to shall solicit
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
public comment my recollection of our
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
May would be
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
preferable because it doesn't it
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
wouldn't slow down the process if if we
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
change that to Shell soliciting public
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
comment could take quite a long time and
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
slow down the process significantly
 
00:51:58.089 --> 00:51:58.099 align:start position:0%
and since this whole
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of Senate Bill 54 is
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
to get these ppeas in place by 2026 as I
 
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.790 align:start position:0%
to get these ppeas in place by 2026 as I
recall

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.690 align:start position:0%
recall
um

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we want to do anything
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
that could slow the process down
 
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
so I would recommend that we leave that
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
as the utilities May solicit public
 
00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.130 align:start position:0%
as the utilities May solicit public
comment

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
well Mr chair respectfully it does say
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
within this period so it's a confined
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
period that's in use already
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
um you know so it's a finite period it
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
won't be any longer than the 60 days
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's the point so what
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
would happen if the utilities were
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
required to solicit public comment
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
within that 60-day period
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
but it did not arrive with the 60-day
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
period expire without public comment or
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
with the 60-day period be extended
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
I think changing that may to a shell
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
would impose conditions on that 60-day
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
well I think the reason it was put in
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
there was the concern for there being an
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
ability for public comment on what will
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
be substantially new and different and
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
large contracts that if there is no um
 
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
you know if there is no explicit request
 
00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
that there be public comment than where
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
where does the public fit into something
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
that they are going to have to pay for
 
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.730 align:start position:0%
that they are going to have to pay for
foreign

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:30.740 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington thank you um I
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying chairman
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it makes a difference
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
whether it's a May or a shell you still
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
get the same problem if they may and
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
let's say the utility decides to go out
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
for public comment and a couple show up
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
but then they start getting them after
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
the 60-day
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
period it's the same issue as if they
 
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
shall do it it doesn't change it one way
 
00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
or the other that way if it's if there's
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
a concern about that uh you could put uh
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
period utilities shout solicit public
 
00:54:05.049 --> 00:54:05.059 align:start position:0%
comment uh
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
all comments must be received within the
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
60-day notice and then that takes care
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
of the ongoing problem so it's clear
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
that if someone delivers a I won't look
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
at someone like Clifton over there but
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
he delivers a book 62 days later you're
 
00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.609 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
I don't feel strongly about that to be
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with changing that made to a
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
the doe there still
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
line 22
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
the department of energy May hire
 
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.890 align:start position:0%
the department of energy May hire
Consultants

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
Consultants
 
00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:48.740 align:start position:0%
you want to change that to a shell too I
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
don't what if the department doesn't
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
need to hire a consultant I don't know
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
I think that should stay a May
 
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that as long as the
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
the utilities have theirs as a shell
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
and then there's
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
um two more bolded changes that I'll
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
refer us to and again the numbers don't
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
call inside so let me figure out what
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's in section three
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
that rolls onto page three
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
contains rate payer protections which
 
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
may include such mechanisms as
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
performance incentives stop loss caps
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
penalties for non-performance or others
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
as proposed by the utility and
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
determined by the commission to be
 
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.349 align:start position:0%
determined by the commission to be
adequate

00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
and then okay before you move on
 
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.329 align:start position:0%
and then okay before you move on
um

00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
one of the commenters
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
on this language suggested that stop
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
are not an appropriate
 
00:55:58.859 --> 00:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
are not an appropriate
um

00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
ratepayer protection mechanism
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
recent experience with stop loss caps
 
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
has not been particularly positive
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
so I would Advocate if we're going to be
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
making changes anyway let's remove
 
00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:17.579 align:start position:0%
the words stop loss caps from that
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
sentence Mr chair I believe that
 
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
language came from doe so I put it in
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
exactly as they asked and what my
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
question would be is what is stop loss
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
caps intended to help protect people
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
from us there's some other term that
 
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
would be suitable to capture it or
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
I think it's this language was intended
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
to capture the mechanism that's in the
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
Burgess PPA
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
the cumulative reduction Factor stop
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
loss cap
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't think even though this
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
language originally was proposed by the
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
DOE I don't think that they would object
 
00:56:58.690 --> 00:56:58.700 align:start position:0%
to the removal of that
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
phrase and I believe one or more of the
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
utilities would prefer the removal of
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
that phrase so if we're going to change
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
it anyway I think we should remove that
 
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:12.170 align:start position:0%
it anyway I think we should remove that
phrase

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:14.180 align:start position:0%
may I just ask a question about that
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
there was there was also language that
 
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
the New England
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
um power generators Association had
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
recommended along these lines talking
 
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
about creating
 
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
um a dollar a dollar cap for I think it
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
was 100 million that they had in there
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not sure I'm no expert on
 
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
any of this I'm not sure how that would
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
help or not but I guess the question
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:57:40.619 --> 00:57:41.690 align:start position:0%
would be
um

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
are there any protections that are going
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
to be written into Statute in terms of
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
the type of loss cap that would be
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
sustained by ratepayers since our intent
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that they
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
are have stabilized rates and or lower
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
rates but not to be
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
um you know having a having a burden
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
to answer your question I would think
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
that the 100 million dollar
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
reference suggested by the any PGA
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
would be virtually identical to a
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
stopwatch stop loss cap so uh
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
I think that the current language which
 
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
suggests mechanisms such as performance
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
incentives and penalties for
 
00:58:30.359 --> 00:58:31.849 align:start position:0%
incentives and penalties for
non-performance

00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
non-performance
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
those would really be the mechanisms
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
that you would use to
 
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
provide rate payer protections I don't
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
know that there are others
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
that this legislation needs to specify
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
it does say or others as proposed by the
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
utility and determined by the commission
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
to be adequate so if there are any other
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
right payer protections That Could Be
 
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
Imagined and proposed then they could be
 
00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:02.049 align:start position:0%
Imagined and proposed then they could be
considered

00:59:02.049 --> 00:59:02.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
yes okay right
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah this um
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
this whole paragraph is kind of uh
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
difficult because
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
um it talks about performance incentives
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
stop-loss caps penalties for
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
non-performance I assume the penalties
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
for non-performance would be uh to the
 
00:59:31.849 --> 00:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
supplier not to the utility because the
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
utility is going to sign a contract in
 
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:35.579 align:start position:0%
that's basically the end of the story
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
for them they're signing a contract with
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
X supplier and sold the penalty for that
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
is I'm guessing if it's that cold winter
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
day and X supplier doesn't Supply
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
whatever Mega watch they were supposed
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
to supply they Supply less then there's
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
going to be a something in the contract
 
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
that would punish them they would have
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
to pay a fine or something like that is
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about here
 
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
and the stop loss cap issue
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
um to me
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
we're trying to predict the future which
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
we know we can't do very well all you
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
have to do is go back to last two the
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
last two Winters
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
um we thought prices were going to be
 
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
much lower two Winters ago and all the
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
suppliers lost a lot of money when it
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
came in much higher and then this last
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
winter everyone thought prices were
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
going to be much much higher than they
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
actually were I mean the death month was
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
supposed to be January we averaged fifty
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
dollars uh the LMP was fifty dollars a
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour much lower than everybody
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
thought so we were off then and now
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking 20 years into the future
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't see how you can reasonably
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
put in a stock loss thing because
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
someone's going to look at that if I'm A
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
supplier I'm going to look at that and
 
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.410 align:start position:0%
supplier I'm going to look at that and
say

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
you want me to sign a contract I'll sign
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
the contract here's what I can live with
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
for a price but don't tell me if the
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
market rates go down substantially that
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get penalized because
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'm outside of the contract
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
so except something to think about well
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
I think the the I just would say in
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
response that it does say which may
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
include these types of mechanisms so
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of listing uh potential
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
mechanisms but it's not imposing any so
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I would say is
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
they're determined to be adequate what
 
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
is that doesn't really say anything uh
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
determined to be in the best interest of
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
rate payers I would change that adequate
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
to best interest of rate payers it gives
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
the puc a little bit more defined I mean
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
adequate is kind of I mean almost a
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
meaningless term in that situation
 
01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.250 align:start position:0%
meaningless term in that situation
and

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
F goes into that stuff like a catch-all
 
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
you can get rid of everything else and
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
just put in
 
01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
factors necessary to determine whether
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
the agreement is just and reasonable in
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
the public interest I mean that covers
 
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.309 align:start position:0%
the public interest I mean that covers
everything

01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if we want to be
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
specific about it
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
we don't want that in there if we don't
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
want to be specific about it you can
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
take everything else out and just put
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
that in
 
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be this seems to be you
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
know uh Belton suspenders here we get
 
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
two sets of criteria you're supposed to
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
do all of this but if there's another
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
factor that puc determines is just and
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable and in the public interest
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
then they don't have to necessarily go
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
along with the other factors above it
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's just it kind of puts them in a
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's really no specific guidance
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
because they can do whatever they feel
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
is just unreasonable
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
so so why don't we just delete the words
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
to be adequate just in that sentence
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
I I would again I would add by the
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
commission to be in the best interest of
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
the rate payers
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
because that's what we're trying to tell
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
them that's that's the message we're
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
sending all along here the best news is
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
the rate pays could be a good Supply in
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
the winter time maybe it's a higher
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
price but it's reliable energy it could
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
also be a lower price contract so that I
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
think that covers
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
okay change to be adequate to be to be
 
01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of rate bears
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
all right it's okay with me looks like
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to be making quite a few
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
changes representative Gorman good that
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
means we can move only in that sentence
 
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:21.059 align:start position:0%
uh so uh representative munz brought
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
something to my attention and I'm
 
01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
looking at page two the last two lines
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
about the long duration winter cold
 
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.150 align:start position:0%
about the long duration winter cold
event

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.650 align:start position:0%
event
and

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
the point that representative Munns made
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
to me was that that's not the only type
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
of weather event that could stress the
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
grid and a supplier right for example a
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
very hot day
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
where we need a lot of power
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
or some other weather related event and
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering should it just be
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
restricted to these long duration winter
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
cold events which we know those were
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
issues recently but we could just as
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
easily have a long duration summer heat
 
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:08.890 align:start position:0%
easily have a long duration summer heat
event

01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:08.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
comment representative Harrington yeah I
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
mean obviously we could have a long hot
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
spell in the in the summertime but the
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of the market change so much
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
because you're not dealing with heating
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
sources and all the ldcs are basically
 
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
selling all the pipeline space that
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
they've contracted into the market for
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
gas fire generators to use so there's
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
virtually no limit I mean if we could go
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
to 100 of all gas fire generators and
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't run out of gas like they
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
do in the winter time you're also going
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
to maximize your solar output during
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
those months as well and the solar gets
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
more and more that's going to be a
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
bigger Factor but so I think that
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
putting this there is is a good idea but
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
I think it needs to be rewarded be
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
worded slightly it says supports
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
electric energy sources the soap
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
supports it's doesn't say anything about
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
producing electricity so if we have a
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
source that produces during The Long
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
Winter durations it's just as important
 
01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:02.420 align:start position:0%
supports tells me it's like transmission
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay so are we going to have we're going
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
to bring trans more transmission so you
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
can get more power from one place to the
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
other place but I think we should have
 
01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know supports electric energy
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
supports electric generation or support
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
of electric energy sources that are
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
expected to be available during the long
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
duration winter cold events so it covers
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
both of those because right now you can
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
make the case that you don't take in
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
account New Generation you just account
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying generation or support I I
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
guess would be creates or supports
 
01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.650 align:start position:0%
guess would be creates or supports
energy

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%

01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
electric energy sources that are
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%

01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
consider whether each agreement is on
 
01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
balance substantially consistent with
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
yeah just say it just create your
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:51.950 align:start position:0%
 
before

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
so creates or supports electric energy
 
01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.849 align:start position:0%
so creates or supports electric energy
sources

01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair there is one more
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
highlighted section that got changed
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
which is on page three and it's Section
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
5 was inserted and the former Section 5
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
was numbered six Roman numeral six so
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
five is to the extent any proposed
 
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.890 align:start position:0%
five is to the extent any proposed
agreement

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
to purchase electrical to purchase
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
electric energy includes environmental
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
attributes such as renewable energy
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
credits the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
shall approve how such environmental
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
attributes are used or disposed of in a
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
manner expected to minimize costs and
 
01:07:41.529 --> 01:07:41.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
would you like to turn on your mic and
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
tell us about that
 
01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.930 align:start position:0%
tell us about that
right

01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
so going back to uh page two the January
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 an incremental electric energy
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
sources trying to make this simple
 
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.169 align:start position:0%
sources trying to make this simple
um

01:08:18.169 --> 01:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:21.729 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:21.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
incremental energy sources are
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
break everything up to the word result
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
and replace it with only the
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
and then keep result of new construction
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
strike the comma and the word are
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
capable of providing additional energy
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
to the iso New England
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
regional market on or after
 
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
January 1 2023.
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
I think that addresses what you're
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.329 --> 01:09:04.339 align:start position:0%
cover definitionally without
 
01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Corman yeah how do you
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
like that change
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
um I feel like it's missing something
 
01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:16.249 align:start position:0%
um I feel like it's missing something
because

01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
current wording talks about the the
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
places that existed already and are
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
being added on to and I think what
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi is omitting is
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
the idea that there was already
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
something existing that got added on to
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
and what we want is just the part that
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
got added on to something existing I
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
think we need to note that there was
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
well then you could add after a new
 
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
construction where I struck out the
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
comma and the word r
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.729 align:start position:0%
 
two

01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:09:58.739 --> 01:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
two
current

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.250 align:start position:0%

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
the r comma
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
where that struck out
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
new construction
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
line 18.
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
construction comma R so strike the comma
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the r
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
after the word construction two current
 
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:45.890 align:start position:0%
after the word construction two current
facilities

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
or two existing facilities or existing
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
facilities yep
 
01:10:51.659 --> 01:10:52.970 align:start position:0%
facilities yep
chairman

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Harrington yeah this
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
is this sentence is already almost six
 
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
lines long which obviously opens it up
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
to all sorts of problems when you start
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
doing it this is this is reminiscent of
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
the NRC they used to do they actually
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
had some that were a page long one
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
sentence and uh leave it the way it is
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
put the clarifying statement next to it
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
separate it's clear people will
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
understand it it won't be we're going to
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
we can interpret this over and over
 
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
again and we're still going to have a
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
very very long sentence that can be
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
confused if we try to add more to it I
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
think just a separate sentence it was
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
suggested earlier would take care of the
 
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.610 align:start position:0%
suggested earlier would take care of the
problem

01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
or his change suggested changes would
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
shorten the sentence quite a bit
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
I think what we're trying to clarify is
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
what the incremental sources are right
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
so we should probably split the sentence
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
there and just put in the definition
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
um put in the definition of new and then
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
put a period after previously existed
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
and start a new sentence that says
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
incremental electric energy sources and
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
Define that clearly and then if you want
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
to add the other sentence that's great
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
but I just think having it all together
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
makes it a little muddy and and to the
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
original point there were two points I
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
think one was that we want to make the
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
distinction that incremental electric
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
sources are those that are constructed
 
01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
at the site of an existing Source but
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
will only be considered in terms of the
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
additional energy
 
01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
um that will be added and I think there
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
were some folks that had uh opposition
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
to that language because we did have
 
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
that in there at one point and then the
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
other question that came up in this
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph Was on or after is it is it
 
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in 2023 backward looking
 
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
or is it supposed to be something that
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
is launching new and add-on facilities
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
that will be created in the future and
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
should the date be further in the future
 
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.689 align:start position:0%
should the date be further in the future
like

01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
2024 2025 so I think those are the two
 
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
things we should also be considering
 
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:58.070 align:start position:0%
things we should also be considering
here

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:03.260 align:start position:0%
oh I would like to see this paragraph
 
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
written out so that I could see
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
my my copy of the amendment is now so
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
marked up
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
that I can't really make this paragraph
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
do you have an online copy of this in a
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
minute yet
 
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:25.970 align:start position:0%
minute yet
and

01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
they did send out in order to discussed
 
01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.330 align:start position:0%
they did send out in order to discussed
before

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
interesting question as I'm copying this
 
01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.830 align:start position:0%
interesting question as I'm copying this
out

01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
on line 16 it says on or after January
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 at a site where no facility
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
previously existed
 
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
well what if
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
the bow plant maribak wants to tear down
 
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
the existing site and then put up a new
 
01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric Hydro hydrogen generation
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
station would that be precluded by this
 
01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.430 align:start position:0%
station would that be precluded by this
language

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
because they're being built on an
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good question so I I think what
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
this which is what this language is
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
so maybe the sentence should just end
 
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:21.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
and then a new sentence would start
 
01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.390 align:start position:0%
and then a new sentence would start
incremental

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
as a result of construction on or after
 
01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:03.020 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2023 at an existing site
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
are capable of providing
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%

01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
so is that the right date for this
 
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.450 align:start position:0%
so is that the right date for this
paragraph

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:41.110 align:start position:0%

foreign

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
as a result of new construction after
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
well all of these dates here basically
 
01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
make this bill retroactive to the
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of this year right
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
so anything that's already been proposed
 
01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
so anything that's already been proposed
or

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know but
 
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
obviously the intent of the bill is to
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
make them
 
01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:27.410 align:start position:0%
make them
eligible

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
on or after dinner first in there yes on
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.659 --> 01:20:05.090 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.169 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
so I missed that little side discussion
 
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
do we put
 
01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:15.470 align:start position:0%
do we put
um

01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
capable of providing additional energy
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
into the iso regional market into this
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
sentence too of this period yep it ends
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
after market period capable of providing
 
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:31.790 align:start position:0%
after market period capable of providing
additional

01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.450 align:start position:0%
 
Magic

01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:40.750 align:start position:0%
 
period

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
so this paragraph would Now read
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this section new
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
electric energy sources are those that
 
01:20:50.689 --> 01:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
are able to provide additional energy
 
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
into the iso regional market ISO New
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
England regional market that first began
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
commercial operation on or after 1-1
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
2023 period
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
incremental energy sources are those
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
that as a result of new construction on
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
or after 1 123 are capable of providing
 
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're at a period after energy or are
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
we adding into the iso New England
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
regional market
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
aftermarket yeah oh so you don't want
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
you do want that okay yeah I think so
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.679 --> 01:21:38.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's necessary regional
 
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.130 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's necessary regional
market

01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.450 align:start position:0%
market
yes

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:45.410 align:start position:0%
yes
yeah

01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
and then the period yeah okay I'm good
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
said do what we what we think needs to
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right so let's
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
Let's do an inventory of the number of
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
changes we need here
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
so the first change would be on page one
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
line 21 change May to Shell
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
age one wine
 
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
age one wine
21.

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
second change would be
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
lines eight
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
basically fourteen through nineteen line
 
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
basically fourteen through nineteen line
eight

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.649 align:start position:0%
 
only

01:22:45.649 --> 01:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay and so we're moving the word only I
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
didn't write this down because we it was
 
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
tentative at the time the word only
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
moves uh between the words four and up
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
I think I think only is good there I
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
like it actually that's I think that's a
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
good point representative Christian I
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
think we can do out do away with the
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
word only altogether
 
01:23:38.689 --> 01:23:38.699 align:start position:0%
without changing the meaning
 
01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
all right so line two is only
 
01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.550 align:start position:0%
all right so line two is only
delete

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
delete
 
01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.070 align:start position:0%
delete
okay

01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.610 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay Third change is lines
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that's a rewrite
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
that we talked about just a minute ago
 
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
Mr exchange is on line 36.
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
page two
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
line 36.
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
where we're going to add
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
creates or
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
creates or
 
01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:26.219 align:start position:0%
with a lowercase s on supports
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
to that sentence correct
 
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.470 align:start position:0%
to that sentence correct
yep

01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
add

01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
add
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
with to be in the best interest of rate
 
01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:43.010 align:start position:0%
with to be in the best interest of rate
flavors

01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
the seventh change will be on page three
 
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
line 15 when we insert the word there
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
to all their distribution repairs okay
 
01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.550 align:start position:0%
to all their distribution repairs okay
yeah

01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.790 align:start position:0%
 
insert

01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.669 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.679 --> 01:26:25.250 align:start position:0%
 
between

01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:42.590 align:start position:0%
 
clearer

01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
I would think it would be yeah
 
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think it hurts to leave it
 
01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think it hurts to leave it
there

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
okay that's seven changes that we need
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
made to this
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
can I suggest one more little grammar
 
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.189 align:start position:0%
can I suggest one more little grammar
change

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
on page okay representative Christian go
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
ahead on page two lines 36 and 37
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
um make it winter cold events
 
01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:28.139 align:start position:0%
and also put a hyphen between long and
 
01:27:28.139 --> 01:27:32.149 align:start position:0%
and also put a hyphen between long and
duration

01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
say that again please
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
um line 37 cold events should be plural
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
and there should be a hyphen between
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:05.390 align:start position:0%
 
.

01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
um okay representative munz you had
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
something to
 
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I wanted to ask if it would
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
be possible to ask a few questions and
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some additional changes
 
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:17.219 align:start position:0%
that we might want to make based on the
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
answer of those questions shoot okay
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
I want to come back to the winter cold
 
01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
event I I guess I don't understand why
 
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't change that to
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
weather related event so that it
 
01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.219 align:start position:0%
encompasses both winter and summer heat
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
wave events they both put a stress both
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
and that's going to become even more
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
significant as more and more people have
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
air conditioning
 
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
well ISO New England has stated that New
 
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
England is becoming a winter peaking
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
region rather than a summer peaking
 
01:28:55.139 --> 01:28:57.950 align:start position:0%
region rather than a summer peaking
region

01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
so I think the original intent of the
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
language here was to
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that there would be adequate
 
01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
energy available
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
during the winter peaking season
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
I thought I had seen some information
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
that suggested there was the opposite
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
that there was becoming more of a summer
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
phenomena than a winter phenomenon it is
 
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.709 align:start position:0%
phenomena than a winter phenomenon it is
already

01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
that is the current situation but we
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
have heard testimony from isono England
 
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay personally opposed to changing this
 
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:35.090 align:start position:0%
okay personally opposed to changing this
to

01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
to taking out the word winter and cold
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
and just say long duration weather
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
events that's what that's what I would
 
01:29:42.719 --> 01:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
events that's what that's what I would
propose

01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.169 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:29:48.179 --> 01:29:50.930 align:start position:0%
oh
seven

01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
yes line 37 essentially change duration
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
winter cold events to
 
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:05.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
and then

01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:07.729 align:start position:0%
and then
um

01:30:07.729 --> 01:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
forgive me if I'm not up on all of the
 
01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
definitions but there's two terms that
 
01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
just keep that jump out at me
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if they have established
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
definitions one is environmental
 
01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:21.830 align:start position:0%
definitions one is environmental
attributes

01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
attributes
 
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
and the second is prudently incurred
 
01:30:24.179 --> 01:30:25.790 align:start position:0%
and the second is prudently incurred
costs

01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:30:28.209 --> 01:30:28.219 align:start position:0%
like I could I could give you my own
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what that means what
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
they could mean but if it's already a
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
defined term then you know so be it
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
I might be able to help on that Mr
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
chairman yes please do yeah prudently
 
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
incurred costs as a common term used
 
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
with the puc and it's well understood
 
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
what that means it's been litigated in
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
courts and everything else it's it's one
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
of those terms that can be could mean a
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
lot of things to a lot of people but
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
it's very specific to the puc and how
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
they do it so Does it include uh profit
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
margin or rate of return calculation
 
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
well in this case we're talking about
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
costs right not profit okay so it would
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
be this is basically going to be a
 
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
pass-through contract right so they're
 
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
going to have costs associated with
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to drop the
 
01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
contract they're going to have to
 
01:31:17.209 --> 01:31:17.219 align:start position:0%
monitor all those are if if it's to have
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
a a big dinner for people that sign the
 
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
contract that's not prudently incurred
 
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
but if it's just to manage the contract
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
and it's prudently incurred it is yeah
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's well defined within the PMC and
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
that and that's utilities that that to
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
me is what it should be so I mean if
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's the definition that's fine what
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
about what about uh environmental
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
attributes environmental attributes I
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
think are just the two words is what
 
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
they say environmental attributes that's
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
there's no specific legal connotation
 
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
with that there's no it's not a defined
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
term in the jargon of Public Utilities
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
it simply means attributes that have to
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
do with the environment and it's not
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
depending would defined than that yeah
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
and because I mean one of the you know
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
my when I initially read this I said oh
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
okay what they're what they're going to
 
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
look at is for example the amount of
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
land or footprint of a facility so that
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
if it's a large solar farm that is a
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
hundred acres
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be a a disqualifying
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
factor or the pollution that it could be
 
01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
generated by that facility and I just
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that's what
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about because I think
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're creating an opportunity here where
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
those are things that could be
 
01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:38.090 align:start position:0%
those are things that could be
considered

01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
for 17 and 18 I should say
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
it talks about environmental attributes
 
01:32:47.570 --> 01:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
comma such as renewable energy credits
 
01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.830 align:start position:0%
comma such as renewable energy credits
comma

01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
comma
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's not exclusive that's
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
just an example I mean if we're if we're
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
talking about renewable energy credits
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
why don't we save renewable energy
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
credits so Mr below since you
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
on which do you think it's clear enough
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this bill
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
or do you think it needs further
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
definition and please come up to the
 
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
microphone and give us your answer thank
 
01:33:12.179 --> 01:33:17.629 align:start position:0%
microphone and give us your answer thank
you

01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
um I I don't believe I was the author of
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
um per se that that's language that came
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
over from the Senate
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
um I did suggest adding the the uh
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
language you suggested at line
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
um 18 such as renewable energy credits
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
which just helps it more tangible uh I
 
01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:41.699 align:start position:0%
think in New England those are presently
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
considered perhaps the only
 
01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
environmental attribute that is traded
 
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
or has a value
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
um in theory there could be others
 
01:33:55.810 --> 01:33:55.820 align:start position:0%
um uh there is for instance uh
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
in in the fuel industry there there's
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
some environmental attributes attributed
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
to renewable natural gas for instance
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
um that that is uh called Ren's so that
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
that would be another type uh of
 
01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
environmental attribute
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
um uh that's traded on at the federal
 
01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.250 align:start position:0%
um uh that's traded on at the federal
level

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
um but there's not too much overlap at
 
01:34:19.970 --> 01:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
this point with the electric sector but
 
01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's just just another example of an
 
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
environmental attribute that there is a
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
market for
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
so the question is can we use that
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
language in environmental attribute
 
01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
without defining it somewhere
 
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I I think so I think it's generally
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
understood uh that uh renewable energy
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
credits are an environmental attribute
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I I think would be okay to substitute
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh renewable energy credits where you
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
use the term environmental attribute but
 
01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
but there is the potential
 
01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
that there could be uh other uh
 
01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes that are
 
01:34:59.810 --> 01:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
attributed to generation in the future
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so does the
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative muns does that satisfy
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.290 align:start position:0%
your question
um

01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
not really
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I thought what the intent of
 
01:35:13.129 --> 01:35:13.139 align:start position:0%
this bill was was to create a as it came
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
over from the Senate was to create a
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
technology neutral kind of environment
 
01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.729 align:start position:0%
technology neutral kind of environment
and

01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know in you know so in instead of I
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
mean there's one instance where I think
 
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's on
 
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
let me just give you a specific
 
01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:35.510 align:start position:0%
let me just give you a specific
reference

01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
no it's in a couple places but just let
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
me if it shows up first in line on page
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:51.239 --> 01:35:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
and you know it talks about multi-year
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
agreements for energy in conjunction
 
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
with or independent of any attendant
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes from electric
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
energy sources and you know I I thought
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
it would be much clearer
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
if we said something along the lines of
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
um enter into multi-year agreements for
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
electricity to be defrost derived from
 
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
any electric energy source regardless of
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
the source of fuel or the means by which
 
01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:21.179 align:start position:0%
such energy is produced
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
because I think that's what we're trying
 
01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can I respond go ahead so I
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
think the section that we're in is about
 
01:36:33.649 --> 01:36:33.659 align:start position:0%
what happens in terms of how the rate
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
payers are going to be treated in this
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreement right so the
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
section is modifying what the Public
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is going to
 
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
consider and approve in terms of trying
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
to bring the best rate deal and so the
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes are
 
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
are an economic attribute of certain
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
types of energy and what it's what it's
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
asking is that
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
those attributes it's if you go on on
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
Section Five there on line 17 on page
 
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:08.990 align:start position:0%
Section Five there on line 17 on page
three

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
to the extent any proposed agreement to
 
01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
purchase electric uh energy includes
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes such as a
 
01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credit the Public
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission shall approve how
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
such environmental attributes are used
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
or disposed of in a manner expected to
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
minimize costs and maximize benefits to
 
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
ratepayers so they're saying that
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
attribute has a value that value needs
 
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
to be distributed to the rate payers so
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
that they benefit from that attribute
 
01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139 align:start position:0%
that's all it's saying it's it's not
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
talking about attributes in the abstract
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's talking about attributes in terms
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
of the value they can bring
 
01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.689 align:start position:0%
of the value they can bring
um

01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
through the contract to the people who
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
are ultimately paying for it I guess
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
then I would just go back to and let's
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman comment
 
01:37:59.110 --> 01:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead getting back to the original
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes I'm I'm not
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
clear what this even says on page one
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
line seven and eight it talks about
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
signing agreements in conjunction with
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
or independent of any environmental
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
attributes so what does that mean you
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
can either take them into consideration
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to or you don't have to if
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
you don't want to it's saying
 
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
right but so what is what does that tell
 
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
you that it's it's in other words if the
 
01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
puc is looking at that contract they go
 
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
like oh this contract has environmental
 
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh attributes this contract doesn't so
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't make any difference
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
because either one is acceptable
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
according to the law so I don't think it
 
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
says anything it doesn't give any
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
guidance to the puc one way or the other
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
if we just want to say fuel neutral or
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
something there but this in conjunction
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
with or independent of is like saying
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
yeah if you have environmental
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
attributes that's fine but if you don't
 
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
that's fine too so you know I'm looking
 
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
here as a former puc commissioner
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
looking at that saying that gives me no
 
01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
guidance on what to do yeah again I
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
think it was what what this was trying
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
to get at in in a kind of cute way was
 
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
fuel neutral that what we're saying is
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to enter into
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
multi-purchase multi-year Power purchase
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
agreements for power from any fuel
 
01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.270 align:start position:0%
agreements for power from any fuel
source

01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
there might there might be another
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this language and that
 
01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:18.790 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this language and that
is

01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
that you can one of these ppas could
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
be for Just Energy
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
or it could include energy and
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates Rex
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
such as the Burgess power biopower PPA
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
it includes energy and wrecks
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what this language is
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that these purchase
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
power agreements can include energy
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
and or wrecks
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's what I think I think
 
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGee had the the right
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
way to say it where there's an economic
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
aspect to the environmental attributes
 
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
they actually have economic value that's
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we mean by environmental
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
attributes I don't know if that needs to
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
be specified in the language here or if
 
01:40:10.729 --> 01:40:10.739 align:start position:0%
that's understood
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
no I I think representative McGee's
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
explanation of SEC the lines you know
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
unpaid on page two it makes perfect
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
sense it's just why do we just say that
 
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
why are we dancing around it and using
 
01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
that is a reasonable question that I
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any answer to because this is
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
the way it came over to us from the
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
Senate well I mean as Mr below said
 
01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
there might be environmental attributes
 
01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh we have a couple of people who like
 
01:40:47.209 --> 01:40:47.219 align:start position:0%
to comment come on up guys
 
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
sure thanks to the committee for letting
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
me come up here to offer some
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
clarification this is in fact focused on
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
the environmental attributes with an
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
economic value and the reason to not
 
01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
include specifically renewable energy
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
credits is because of the existence of
 
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
other environmental attributes with
 
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
value mrbilla mentioned rinse there are
 
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
also a number of possibilities of New
 
01:41:21.169 --> 01:41:21.179 align:start position:0%
Market structures in the future that
 
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
this would
 
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
Encompass so it is not meant to be an
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list of what can be included
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
for environmental attributes but is
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
meant to be flexible why don't we then
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
say he used the the perfect term why
 
01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
don't we just change it to say economic
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
attributes with economic value
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
I think that makes it very clear that
 
01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that and not things
 
01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:45.590 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that and not things
like

01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
how big the plant is
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
well I think the reason the answer to
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
your question is because the puc doesn't
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
really concern itself that much with
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
those kinds of economic
 
01:41:59.639 --> 01:42:02.450 align:start position:0%
those kinds of economic
decisions

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
I I would offer that in um environmental
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
attributes is a term that is commonly
 
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
used in rate making and in this Arena so
 
01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
it is commonly understood to include
 
01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:15.410 align:start position:0%
it is commonly understood to include
those

01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:17.090 align:start position:0%
those
okay

01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.590 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
my next issue you can
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
um and since we have some
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
representatives from doe maybe they can
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
answer the question why is it January
 
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
1st 2023
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
I do think that this was something that
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
was related to when the bill was
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
started when this process began and I
 
01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.950 align:start position:0%
started when this process began and I
would

01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
have to think pause more if we would
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
have a a issue with changing that date
 
01:43:04.209 --> 01:43:04.219 align:start position:0%
to a more forward-looking
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
approach but it was related to when the
 
01:43:12.129 --> 01:43:12.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
I do not have a position on that
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
I mean I I don't
 
01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
you know if unless unless there's a good
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
reason for it I don't know why we would
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
make it retroactive
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
have it be January 1st of 2024 have it
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.739 --> 01:43:33.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:43:33.169 --> 01:43:33.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
anybody feel strongly one way or the
 
01:43:37.850 --> 01:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
other about that I don't have a
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
strong objection to changing those dates
 
01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:41.629 align:start position:0%
strong objection to changing those dates
to

01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
so on or after upon passage this would
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
I don't care any date in the future
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll change those two
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
dates change those two januaries to
 
01:44:19.139 --> 01:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
dates change those two januaries to
September

01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
yeah why not
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
so it's in the future
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
and sorry Mr chair but I've got a couple
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
more before you get let me write this
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
one down I just want to make sure that
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about then changes on page
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
two lines 16 and 19.
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
yes it's gone oh that one's gone okay
 
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
that's right there's no wording but in
 
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
that paragraph
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
and only only in that paragraph
 
01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:54.050 align:start position:0%
and only only in that paragraph
yeah well

01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah 17 also but in that
 
01:44:59.330 --> 01:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
paragraph we're changing January to
 
01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:01.970 align:start position:0%
paragraph we're changing January to
September

01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay so that's uh page
 
01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.990 align:start position:0%
okay so that's uh page
two

01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.550 align:start position:0%
 
16.

01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
16.
 
01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.950 align:start position:0%
16.
change

01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.990 align:start position:0%
change
January

01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
January
 
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
to September
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay what's your next problem
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
they're not problems Mr chair
 
01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:28.550 align:start position:0%
they're not problems Mr chair
suggestions

01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.270 align:start position:0%
suggestions
um

01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
in section three on page two
 
01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:35.219 align:start position:0%
um we list a number of things that the
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is going to
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
look at when they make their decision
 
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.179 align:start position:0%
which I I don't disagree with any of
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
them but I I think it would be
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
beneficial if we added added one
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh that says something along the lines
 
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
of generates Economic Development and
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits for New Hampshire
 
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
because I think you know
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
as much as you know we
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
I think one of the objectives of this
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill unspoken objectives perhaps is that
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know we try to encourage as much
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
development in New Hampshire as possible
 
01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:10.910 align:start position:0%
development in New Hampshire as possible
and

01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
that language would do that
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
it would just say that you know
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
basically what it would say is that if a
 
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
project comes along that it's based in
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it would get if it had to
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
be compared to another project and
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
everything else being the same the
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
project in New Hampshire would get
 
01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.209 align:start position:0%
project in New Hampshire would get
preference

01:46:29.209 --> 01:46:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
I get your point but I think it's
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
covered by if you turn the page and go
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
you've got other factors that have to be
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration here
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
diversification of New Hampshire's
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
electric energy sources that that could
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
happen all other factors necessary to
 
01:46:51.169 --> 01:46:51.179 align:start position:0%
determine whether the agreement is just
 
01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:53.219 align:start position:0%
unreasonable I think it's
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's covered adequately without making a
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
future further change
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're rapidly with eight changes
 
01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.510 align:start position:0%
we're we're rapidly with eight changes
already

01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
envisioned we're rapidly running into
 
01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:06.659 align:start position:0%
the possibility that
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate won't agree to some of these
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
changes and then we'll have a a
 
01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
difficult process they couldn't possibly
 
01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead I understand the theory
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
behind that but that really opens this
 
01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:26.699 align:start position:0%
thing up to politics because then you're
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
going to have people lobbying uh whether
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
it be State reps or state senators
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
saying well they're going to build this
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
thing in my district and they're going
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
to be trying to put pressure on the puc
 
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
and we could come up in the governor's
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
office or whatever I think it's
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
something that's covered enough in the
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill but if you specifically say that
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
then um
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
I think it gets covered under the what's
 
01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
best for the rate payers in New
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if you're creating work and
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
stuff in New Hampshire the puc can look
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
at that and say okay well everything
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
else being equal it's better to contract
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
with somebody in New Hampshire as
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
compared to somebody in Maine but I
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to make it specific
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
because it just really opens up the door
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
with all due respect representative muns
 
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
I think maybe we'll forgo forego that
 
01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:10.870 align:start position:0%
I think maybe we'll forgo forego that
um

01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
can't win them all
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay uh last
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
one more last comment last comment
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
um one of the stated objectives of the
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill is to
 
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and I want to look at the exact
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
language here
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
um address Market Village Market
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
volatility which is harming New
 
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and businesses yet
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't really do anything
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
about that because what it does is it
 
01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
allows depending on what the whole
 
01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:42.980 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the wholesale Market
 
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:47.219 align:start position:0%
it allows rates to be to be adjusted up
 
01:48:48.649 --> 01:48:48.659 align:start position:0%
or down every year based on what's going
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
on in the wholesale Market
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
and I mean one one alternative to that
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to throw that out
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
because I know that the appetite for
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
changes is minimal right now at 10 to
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
11. but one alternative to that is to
 
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
instead set up some kind of a
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund where if there is if
 
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market goes way up that
 
01:49:12.169 --> 01:49:12.179 align:start position:0%
money gets put into a bank and then when
 
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
the market goes down that money gets
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
pulled out to keep the rate stable
 
01:49:19.729 --> 01:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
um I just throw that out because
 
01:49:19.739 --> 01:49:20.570 align:start position:0%
um I just throw that out because
um

01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
you're still going to see spikes in the
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
price of electricity with the way this
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
is worded there's no stabilization
 
01:49:26.639 --> 01:49:28.970 align:start position:0%
is worded there's no stabilization
mechanism

01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
I think that suggestion would
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
potentially run into some takings Clause
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
issues so
 
01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
that might be a subject for a future
 
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:42.169 align:start position:0%
that might be a subject for a future
bill

01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.609 --> 01:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
all right are we satisfied that we have
 
01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
adequate changes to make to this
 
01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:50.270 align:start position:0%
adequate changes to make to this
amendment

01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
so the next question is how are we going
 
01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
to get this get this done
 
01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
oh we have one more Amendment change to
 
01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
consider go ahead representative
 
01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:27.530 align:start position:0%
consider go ahead representative
Harrington

01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's on Future Energy prices is we know
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
nothing about future energy prices and
 
01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
every time we try to predict the future
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're almost always wrong uh the thing I
 
01:50:54.410 --> 01:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier about the last two
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
Winters two Winters ago everyone thought
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
the prices were going to be lower than
 
01:50:59.930 --> 01:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
they actually turned out to be last
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
winter everyone thought they were going
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
to be higher this is sort of a knee-jerk
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
reaction to last winter where the ever
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
never-ending need of legislators to do
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
stuff so we can go back to our
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
constituent and say we're doing stuff
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
but I think doing stuff for 10 years is
 
01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
a long enough stretch because we can't
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
even predict three or four months in
 
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
advance as we've shown twice in a row
 
01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.149 align:start position:0%
advance as we've shown twice in a row
now

01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
let's limit it to 10 years and things
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
will still get built if that's the
 
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
intent of this to bring on new new
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
generation because it's happening across
 
01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
the country but we minimize the risk by
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
making it 10 years instead of 20. and
 
01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
anyone who thinks they can predict
 
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen 20 years from now
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
in the energy markets uh is either a
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
fool or they're just confused because no
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
one never gets it right
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
so this would be page two line six
 
01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:51.890 align:start position:0%
so this would be page two line six
so

01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear from the Department of
 
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:55.310 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear from the Department of
energy

01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:51:58.490 --> 01:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
why the bill was written with 20 years
 
01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:00.890 align:start position:0%
why the bill was written with 20 years
initially

01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
initially
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
and will it make
 
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
any kind of significant difference to
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.209 --> 01:52:14.219 align:start position:0%
thank you so our position was 20 years
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
we have come to the table with that and
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
I think that's what we are most
 
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable with their
 
01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
we we don't want to commit to any subset
 
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
of resources we don't know what kind of
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
resources are going to come forward for
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
these contracts and we we don't want to
 
01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
limit that based on the long-term
 
01:52:36.530 --> 01:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
potential viability 20 years is is the
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
common term for or at least has been the
 
01:52:40.609 --> 01:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
common term for these long-term
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
agreements in in other states in the
 
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
region and again we don't want to limit
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
the types of resources that can
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
can apply for this
 
01:52:55.729 --> 01:52:55.739 align:start position:0%
okay so there's no real hard and fast
 
01:52:58.370 --> 01:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
reason why 20 years was chosen it was
 
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
just chosen to to give maximum
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility to these ppas
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
is that what I'm hearing you say
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes but I do want to point out that
 
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
it is it is
 
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
um it's not saying it will be a 20-year
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
term right it's enabling up to a 20-year
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
term and the length of the contract
 
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
would would be something that the
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
commission is going to look at when
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
they're evaluating these deals to find
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
out if something is in the public
 
01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:24.530 align:start position:0%
out if something is in the public
interest

01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay representative Harrington yeah just
 
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh you are correct in the past it has
 
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
been 20 years but over the last few
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
years uh as you can see by this list
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
these are it's gone down and a lot of
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
that is because for the most part I've
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
been told it's the actual Builders who
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
are saying we don't want to commit that
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
long because they think longer term
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
especially Renewables that they're going
 
01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:49.139 align:start position:0%
to be more competitive in the future so
 
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
if they have a 10-year contract and they
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
can come back out and sign another one
 
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
10 years from now and up the price
 
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
because the market prices are going to
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
be going higher so I I just think the
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
risk could be limited by making it 10
 
01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
years and you can still get stuff built
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative muns uh I I just want to
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
Echo what the gentleman from the doe
 
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
said I mean my experience is that
 
01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
20-year power purchase Agreements are
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
are kind of the the norm particularly
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to do a a project
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
financed project where you're you're
 
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
using the power purchase agreement as
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
kind of your um
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
your collateral with the lender and that
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
would be my only concern that that by
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
limiting it to 10 years it might cut off
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
some potential financing that might be
 
01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.450 align:start position:0%
some potential financing that might be
available

01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington the current
 
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
language says up to
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
20. it doesn't say it has to be 20 it
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
just says it can be 20. but it can be
 
01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
anything between 0 and 20.
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't that cover just about all the
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
bases I mean
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
that allows for an up to 20-year
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
contract like I say no one is if you
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
find somebody that can predict Future
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
Energy prices let me know I'll invest in
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
their company but what I'm saying is if
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're true that this table should have
 
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
said all these other producers are not
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
signing 20-year contracts then isn't it
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
likely that anybody who does anything
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
under this legislation would also say no
 
01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing 20 probably but I they
 
01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
just want to make more protection to the
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
rate payers for not getting stuck with
 
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
something that's doesn't turn out to be
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
that good so suffering for 10 years
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
isn't as bad as suffering for 20.
 
01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:34.490 align:start position:0%
isn't as bad as suffering for 20.
yeah

01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
what would you guys think you know um
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
your legislature representative
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
Harrington I'm certainly sensitive to
 
01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
your view and and you know share it I
 
01:55:48.590 --> 01:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
will say that there is going to be a
 
01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
rigorous review of these from the
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the consumer
 
01:55:53.209 --> 01:55:53.219 align:start position:0%
Advocate and and the commission when
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
they make their evaluation enabling
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
something up to 20 years we felt covered
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
the gamut of of what's traditionally
 
01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
been done here and the potential
 
01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
resources that could respond to a an RFP
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to be enabling knowing on
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
the back end there will be that that
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
rigorous review but um that's that's
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
where our approach has been
 
01:56:19.370 --> 01:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah I just I
 
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to weigh in at this point because
 
01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:25.370 align:start position:0%
wanted to weigh in at this point because
I

01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
I feel as though
 
01:56:29.159 --> 01:56:29.930 align:start position:0%
I feel as though
um

01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
my my colleagues comments about the
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
future of the energy market and the
 
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.169 align:start position:0%
future of the energy market and the
um

01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:42.179 align:start position:0%
reducing Risk by limiting contracts to
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
um betrays a
 
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
they bias toward
 
01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
traditional fossil fuel energy markets
 
01:56:55.970 --> 01:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
when this bill started out in the Senate
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
it was specifically
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
aimed at enabling
 
01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:03.659 align:start position:0%
long-term power purchase agreements for
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
renewable resources and it was of course
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
broadened to be technology neutral and
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.209 align:start position:0%
that's fine
but

01:57:13.209 --> 01:57:13.219 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
as my
 
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
Democratic colleague representative muns
 
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
alluded to
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
particularly with Renewables the power
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement is critical
 
01:57:25.679 --> 01:57:26.689 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement is critical
um

01:57:26.689 --> 01:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
critical aspect of getting such a
 
01:57:30.970 --> 01:57:30.980 align:start position:0%
project built and financed
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
circling back to the
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
you know comments of Representative
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
Harrington you know who can predict the
 
01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
energy markets
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
20 years from now well I can predict
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
that the price of sunshine and wind 20
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
years from now will still be zero so
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
a project developer capitalizing a solar
 
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
farm or wind farm
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
and the batteries
 
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
necessary to make that that generating
 
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
asset more reliable and capable of
 
01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:05.209 align:start position:0%
asset more reliable and capable of
providing

01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:58:05.219 --> 01:58:05.990 align:start position:0%
providing
um

01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
you know during
 
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
Darkness during lack of sunshine wind
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
needs the 20-year PPA
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
to to finance and and again the fuel
 
01:58:19.129 --> 01:58:19.139 align:start position:0%
price of those projects is going to be
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
zero so that's why they need the 20-year
 
01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
PPA to offer into the market a stable
 
01:58:28.490 --> 01:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
price for 20 years so
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
we if we quote reduce risk we're
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
actually going to as again Mike esteemed
 
01:58:35.930 --> 01:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
colleague representative Harrington is
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting we're actually going to be
 
01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:39.350 align:start position:0%
suggesting we're actually going to be
eliminating

01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.370 align:start position:0%
eliminating
um

01:58:40.370 --> 01:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
some generation resources from the
 
01:58:42.599 --> 01:58:44.089 align:start position:0%
some generation resources from the
market

01:58:44.089 --> 01:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
if I could respond to it oh yes you can
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead first of all these are all
 
01:58:52.609 --> 01:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
renewable projects they are being built
 
01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
and none of them have a 20-year thing as
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
far as biased towards uh non-renewable
 
01:59:00.890 --> 01:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
energy well when you think I'm biased on
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
that if not is really irrelevant look at
 
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
the iso New England queue you will not
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
find I think there's one
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 megawatt gas speaker in the
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
queue everything else is solar in wind
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
and battery storage so what is going to
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
be built is going to be renewable energy
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
no one is going to is talking about
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
putting in a new large gas plant or
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
anything like that so
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
again projects are being built and
 
01:59:30.050 --> 01:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
they're they're all renewable projects
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
all that list that I gave you well with
 
01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
1300 megawatts and they're being built
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
without 20-year contracts so I think if
 
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
we can minimize the risk by cutting that
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
back because who knows maybe maybe the
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
the never-ending uh story of fusion
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
power being uh present in the next 10
 
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
years which has been been told since I
 
01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
was in Graduate School uh we'll come to
 
01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
a fruition and prices will drop
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
substantially but the one like I say the
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
only thing we know about future energy
 
01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
prices is we don't know anything about
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
future energy prices and I think 10
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
years is an adequate term to get the
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.810 --> 02:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative Christian
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to point out um
 
02:00:09.290 --> 02:00:09.300 align:start position:0%
on this great list that you gave us so
 
02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
although none of them are 20-year most
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
of them the majority of them are more
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
than 10 years so I think at least 15 uh
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
make sense given the number of 12 and 15
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Lakota did you have a suggestion to
 
02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:28.430 align:start position:0%
Mr Lakota did you have a suggestion to
make

02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:00:32.089 --> 02:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
Porter Mr chair
 
02:00:32.099 --> 02:00:35.290 align:start position:0%
Porter Mr chair
yes

02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you would the chair consider for
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
the record to uh acknowledge the
 
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
representatives DLT I don't think they
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
stated the name for the records Mr
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
Pearland and others
 
02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
Pearland and others
foreign

02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
sure so for the record my name is Chris
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
selms Deputy Commissioner and I was
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
joined by Dan Phelan who is the
 
02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
wholesale administrator for the
 
02:00:57.410 --> 02:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
Department of energy thank you for doing
 
02:00:57.420 --> 02:00:58.310 align:start position:0%
Department of energy thank you for doing
that

02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:00.649 --> 02:01:00.659 align:start position:0%
Mr locata
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
please tell us who you are and who you
 
02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:05.030 align:start position:0%
please tell us who you are and who you
represent

02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
morning Michael akata eversource
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I don't have too too much
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
to add I would
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
um say that the points made about the
 
02:01:16.209 --> 02:01:16.219 align:start position:0%
flexibility of the term up to 20 years
 
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
are important that that is a a
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
requirement for some projects to obtain
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
financing to have that uh long-term I
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
think the points about uh you know you
 
02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
might reduce the number of respondents
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
this is already a very rigorous review
 
02:01:36.649 --> 02:01:36.659 align:start position:0%
that is very focused on price and
 
02:01:36.659 --> 02:01:38.169 align:start position:0%
that is very focused on price and
reliability

02:01:38.169 --> 02:01:38.179 align:start position:0%
reliability
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
and from the utility perspective of
 
02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
issuing these rfps I think further
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
limitations might actually result in in
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
potentially a failed RFP so I I think
 
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
the points made about the importance of
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
keeping the flexibility of up to 20
 
02:01:59.450 --> 02:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
years and then having uh as I think the
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
doe had stated the rigorous review on
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
the back end uh are are well put
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
based on your experience would 15 years
 
02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
be long enough to to ensure the
 
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
adequate response to these rfps or does
 
02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
it need to be 20. I think 20 is an
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
industry standard it is consistent with
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
other uh rfps that have been put out in
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
the region that is something that
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
developers are familiar with that they
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
can sort of use to to obtain their
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
required financing so I would suggest uh
 
02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
leaving at 20.
 
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
all right I would uh representative
 
02:02:43.129 --> 02:02:43.139 align:start position:0%
Harrington goes one final comment on
 
02:02:43.139 --> 02:02:44.149 align:start position:0%
Harrington goes one final comment on
that

02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
um all we have to do is look at the
 
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
Burgess biomass contract that was done
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
rigorously it was scrubbed every way you
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
possibly could the puc looked over that
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
for months they had hearings with a
 
02:02:55.970 --> 02:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
bunch of people they had meetings this
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
went on for for a long time and it's
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
proved that it's been a disaster
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
financially for New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
just thinking you can have all the
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
different reviews and this and that you
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
want but you still cannot predict the
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
future accurately when it comes to
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
Energy prices so the limit on the time I
 
02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
could go with 15 years it reduces the
 
02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
we have 10
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee here let's see
 
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
a show of hands who people from people
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
who want to keep it at 20 or keep people
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
who want to uh yeah let's do people want
 
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay that's eight out of ten so I think
 
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh maybe we'll just leave this at 20.
 
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
since it's up to 20 I think it's fairly
 
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
safe to do that
 
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
but we appreciate you bringing it up
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
all right so now we have eight Amendment
 
02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made here
 
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
so we're going to need to walk this over
 
02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
to OLS and get them to
 
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
work on this if we're going to have any
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
chance of having
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
a workable amendment by two o'clock this
 
02:04:16.679 --> 02:04:17.810 align:start position:0%
a workable amendment by two o'clock this
afternoon

02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
so I have I made the electronic changes
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
and I can shoot them to Christy and to
 
02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.950 align:start position:0%
and I can shoot them to Christy and to
OLS

02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
OLS
 
02:04:27.770 --> 02:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
02:04:36.890 --> 02:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.450 --> 02:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
so that's how we'll proceed proceed
 
02:04:45.649 --> 02:04:45.659 align:start position:0%
Christy you'll take a look at her draft
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
I'll take a letter a look at her draft
 
02:04:52.609 --> 02:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
one last thing we need to do is vote as
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee on whether to accept
 
02:05:03.890 --> 02:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
the new amendment that will will will
 
02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
shortly be proposed that includes all
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
the changes that we've gone over here
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation to the full
 
02:05:14.689 --> 02:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
committee to pass Senate bills 54 by
 
02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:17.219 align:start position:0%
adopting this amendment so we have four
 
02:05:19.250 --> 02:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee here
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
if you are in favor of making that
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation please say I I
 
02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed
 
02:05:31.250 --> 02:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay four members of the subcommittee
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
are here and four vote affirmative
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
to make the recommendation to the full
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
committee that we adopt Senate Bill 54
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
move in a second
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
you moved it I moved it representative
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the paperwork it was
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded and then we voted
 
02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
four to nothing
 
02:05:58.910 --> 02:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
to recommend that the full committee
 
02:06:02.089 --> 02:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
adopt SB 54 as amended by a new
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that will be available by two
 
02:06:07.330 --> 02:06:07.340 align:start position:0%
o'clock hopefully
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
and with that I think we're going to
 
02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
shut down our activity for the moment
 
02:06:15.229 --> 02:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
we'll meet back here at two o'clock to
 
02:06:17.209 --> 02:06:17.219 align:start position:0%
go into executive session
 
02:06:20.209 --> 02:06:20.219 align:start position:0%
there will be a majority Caucus meeting
 
02:06:22.669 --> 02:06:22.679 align:start position:0%
in this room at one o'clock
 
02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
so we'll need the room need the room to
 
02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
ourselves at that moment
 
02:06:30.410 --> 02:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
but it'll be back open by 20 minutes of
 
02:06:33.050 --> 02:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
two so we'll see you all then have a
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%

05:01:37.128 --> 05:01:37.138 align:start position:0%

second it's been moved and seconded that
 
05:01:49.970 --> 05:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
we resolve to pass Amendment 2023 1586 h
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:55.320 --> 05:01:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:59.448 --> 05:01:59.458 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment well I would
 
05:02:02.090 --> 05:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
just draw your attention to a
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
parenthetical phrase on line 17 page two
 
05:02:09.410 --> 05:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
which uh we had intended to strike which
 
05:02:10.970 --> 05:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
I would ask that we
 
05:02:10.980 --> 05:02:12.050 align:start position:0%
I would ask that we
um

05:02:12.050 --> 05:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to strike whether
 
05:02:15.050 --> 05:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's going to be once it's over the
 
05:02:18.650 --> 05:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
wall or in a committee of conference
 
05:02:21.310 --> 05:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
um and that would be on line 17 after
 
05:02:24.050 --> 05:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
2023 rather than a comma that would be a
 
05:02:25.970 --> 05:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
period and the parenthetical phrase that
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be removed is at a site where no
 
05:02:31.850 --> 05:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:33.470 --> 05:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
05:02:37.010 --> 05:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
there were eight changes made in this
 
05:02:40.250 --> 05:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment that we
 
05:02:42.288 --> 05:02:42.298 align:start position:0%
worked off of in the committee work
 
05:02:44.750 --> 05:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
session earlier this morning
 
05:02:44.760 --> 05:02:46.610 align:start position:0%
session earlier this morning
and

05:02:46.610 --> 05:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:49.010 --> 05:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
we have verified that all those changes
 
05:02:50.570 --> 05:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
were made
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the change that representative McGee
 
05:02:58.368 --> 05:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
just suggested was an oversight on what
 
05:03:03.530 --> 05:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
we submitted to OLS so I propose that we
 
05:03:07.730 --> 05:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment as
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
offered to us from OLS and we take care
 
05:03:13.868 --> 05:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
of that parenthetical or that
 
05:03:17.770 --> 05:03:17.780 align:start position:0%
prepositional phrase during the
 
05:03:19.730 --> 05:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
committee of conference process
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah just so
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's clear to everybody why we wanted to
 
05:03:26.270 --> 05:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
take that out is because if we were to
 
05:03:28.430 --> 05:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
repower a facility such as like the bow
 
05:03:31.368 --> 05:03:31.378 align:start position:0%
plant or any other closed plant it would
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
already have a facility previously
 
05:03:35.390 --> 05:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
existed but it's been shut down so if
 
05:03:37.490 --> 05:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
you're going to repower it with some
 
05:03:39.530 --> 05:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
other type of Technology you shouldn't
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
eliminate the plant because you may be
 
05:03:43.250 --> 05:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
able to make use of parts of the plant
 
05:03:45.288 --> 05:03:45.298 align:start position:0%
and certainly the transmission lines so
 
05:03:47.090 --> 05:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for we want to get
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
all right further discussion on this
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
amendment for those of you who are not
 
05:03:57.470 --> 05:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
here this morning or at our other work
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
sessions are there questions
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:04:01.680 --> 05:04:02.750 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
chair

05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
um you said there were eight eight
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
changes to this could you just briefly
 
05:04:09.770 --> 05:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
go over them yes thank you okay so the
 
05:04:15.170 --> 05:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
the utilities shall solicit public
 
05:04:21.410 --> 05:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
comment previously the text said the
 
05:04:23.810 --> 05:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
utilities May solicit public content
 
05:04:23.820 --> 05:04:28.430 align:start position:0%
utilities May solicit public content
comment

05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.128 --> 05:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
the next change we made was on page two
 
05:04:34.138 --> 05:04:36.170 align:start position:0%
the next change we made was on page two
lines

05:04:36.170 --> 05:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:04:36.180 --> 05:04:38.270 align:start position:0%
lines
15

05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
15
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
line eight excuse me line eight
 
05:04:44.990 --> 05:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
where we struck the word only
 
05:04:47.150 --> 05:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
which was a Superfluous word as it turns
 
05:04:47.160 --> 05:04:48.170 align:start position:0%
which was a Superfluous word as it turns
out

05:04:48.170 --> 05:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:04:50.990 --> 05:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
and then on lines
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
15 through 20
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
we broke up a previously
 
05:05:01.250 --> 05:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
awkward paragraph which contained both
 
05:05:05.090 --> 05:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
definitions we broke that up into two
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
sentences with each definition
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
listed separately
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
we also changed the date to September
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
1st of 2023 it had been January 1st
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
but we saw no need to make it
 
05:05:20.520 --> 05:05:24.050 align:start position:0%
but we saw no need to make it
retroactive

05:05:24.050 --> 05:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:24.060 --> 05:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
next

05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
next
 
05:05:28.850 --> 05:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
was excuse me we also changed the
 
05:05:31.250 --> 05:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
wording for incremental electric energy
 
05:05:34.730 --> 05:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
sources we did rewrite that yes we did
 
05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
incremental energy sources that
 
05:05:43.788 --> 05:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
definition we wrote that somewhat just
 
05:05:47.208 --> 05:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that it was
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
just the new energy than an existing
 
05:05:53.448 --> 05:05:53.458 align:start position:0%
Source produced not the entire energy
 
05:05:55.850 --> 05:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
output of that source that would be
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
considered under this uh proposal
 
05:06:01.550 --> 05:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
or this legislation
 
05:06:04.490 --> 05:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
next we go down to line
 
05:06:04.500 --> 05:06:13.190 align:start position:0%
next we go down to line
35

05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
36 yes
 
05:06:18.170 --> 05:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
and we
 
05:06:18.180 --> 05:06:20.208 align:start position:0%
and we
added

05:06:20.208 --> 05:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
added
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
no actually it's it led over to the next
 
05:06:25.250 --> 05:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
page the first page of Page Three
 
05:06:27.650 --> 05:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
the first line of Page Three we added
 
05:06:30.110 --> 05:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
the words creates or
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
to that line so it previously read
 
05:06:33.650 --> 05:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
supports Electric
 
05:06:36.110 --> 05:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
energy sources we changed it to read
 
05:06:38.930 --> 05:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
creates or supports electric energy
 
05:06:38.940 --> 05:06:40.490 align:start position:0%
creates or supports electric energy
sources

05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
sources
 
05:06:42.410 --> 05:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
and we changed winter event to weather
 
05:06:42.420 --> 05:06:43.368 align:start position:0%
and we changed winter event to weather
event

05:06:43.368 --> 05:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
event
 
05:06:46.970 --> 05:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
correct then we changed in line two long

yep
 
05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
so on line four
 
05:07:10.730 --> 05:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
we struck the
 
05:07:14.090 --> 05:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
parenthetical phrase stop loss caps
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%

05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:07:23.208 --> 05:07:23.218 align:start position:0%
we deleted the the text
 
05:07:25.490 --> 05:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
adequate and replaced it with the text
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be in the best interest of rate
 
05:07:27.120 --> 05:07:29.570 align:start position:0%
to be in the best interest of rate
payers

05:07:29.570 --> 05:07:29.580 align:start position:0%

05:07:35.930 --> 05:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:42.770 --> 05:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.448 --> 05:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
edit that there
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes so it is line 17 so we added the
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
word there between the words all and
 
05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
distribution so it now reads credit or
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
charge all their distribution rate pairs
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
the difference blah blah blah
 
05:07:58.850 --> 05:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
so those are all the changes that we
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
made to the amendment
 
05:08:01.200 --> 05:08:03.350 align:start position:0%
made to the amendment
and

05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
in my discussions with the other members
 
05:08:07.730 --> 05:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
it seems that everyone is now satisfied
 
05:08:12.110 --> 05:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
that we have done everything we can do
 
05:08:14.690 --> 05:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
to make Senate Bill 54 the best Bill it
 
05:08:15.890 --> 05:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
can be
 
05:08:18.530 --> 05:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to hear other reaction from
 
05:08:23.448 --> 05:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.368 --> 05:08:25.378 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
05:08:27.788 --> 05:08:27.798 align:start position:0%
Mr chair in in deference to
 
05:08:32.208 --> 05:08:32.218 align:start position:0%
representative uh Chariton we forgot the
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
The Hyphen between long and duration
 
05:08:40.128 --> 05:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
well we suggested it to OLS and they
 
05:08:42.410 --> 05:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
declined to accept that suggestion so
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to all this on that
 
05:08:44.160 --> 05:08:45.350 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to all this on that
one

05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:08:47.690 --> 05:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I you guys
 
05:08:50.930 --> 05:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
probably talked about it this morning
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
but I am happy to see from subcommittee
 
05:08:56.570 --> 05:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
on page three line 12 it was changed to
 
05:08:59.090 --> 05:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
shallow instead of May there
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
so that was probably changed before this
 
05:09:02.570 --> 05:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
morning but that was a change that was
 
05:09:06.650 --> 05:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:12.970 --> 05:09:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:16.490 --> 05:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
well representative Harrington yeah I
 
05:09:17.930 --> 05:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
just for the record I guess I want to
 
05:09:19.610 --> 05:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
say this is a I hope people realize this
 
05:09:21.170 --> 05:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
is a major change that we're
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
contemplating here kind of uh going
 
05:09:25.310 --> 05:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
stepping back a little bit too before
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
restructuring because now we're talking
 
05:09:30.050 --> 05:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
about the utilities locking in long-term
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
contracts that the rate payers are going
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
to Bear all the responsibility for and
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
basically whatever risk is associated is
 
05:09:39.530 --> 05:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
being born by the rate payers now there
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
are some Provisions in here to try to do
 
05:09:42.830 --> 05:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
something but I'm not sure how you're
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
going to come up with a contract that is
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
going to be signed by A supplier for 20
 
05:09:50.090 --> 05:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
years if it's not kind of like locked in
 
05:09:53.330 --> 05:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
at this rate or something so I know I'll
 
05:09:55.490 --> 05:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
probably vote in favor I will vote in
 
05:09:56.690 --> 05:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
favor of this I just want people to
 
05:09:58.788 --> 05:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
understand this is a big change and
 
05:10:01.730 --> 05:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's something that uh you
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
know we try and see what happens but I'm
 
05:10:06.410 --> 05:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
a little leery about going back to that
 
05:10:09.170 --> 05:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
rate payer risk rather than uh the other
 
05:10:12.230 --> 05:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.330 --> 05:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
05:10:16.550 --> 05:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chair I agree with my
 
05:10:19.850 --> 05:10:19.860 align:start position:0%

05:10:20.930 --> 05:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
agreeing to it but with some degree of
 
05:10:25.730 --> 05:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
interpretation on any long-term
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%

amendment two zero two three one five

to pass as amended and recognize
 
05:11:53.448 --> 05:11:53.458 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yes I'd like to
 
05:11:55.730 --> 05:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
second that motion
 
05:11:57.770 --> 05:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
05:11:59.510 --> 05:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
resolved to judge
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54 as ought to pass as
 
05:12:05.650 --> 05:12:05.660 align:start position:0%
amended amended by Amendment
 
05:12:08.510 --> 05:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
2023-1586 H is there any further
 
05:12:13.490 --> 05:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:15.708 --> 05:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
I will add my voice to the chorus that
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
says that while this bill
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
does not guarantee that anything good is
 
05:12:22.730 --> 05:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
05:12:24.050 --> 05:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
it does
 
05:12:26.750 --> 05:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
potentially enable the possibility that
 
05:12:28.490 --> 05:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
something good could happen
 
05:12:31.970 --> 05:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any negative or downside
 
05:12:35.090 --> 05:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
to this bill so I will be happy to
 
05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
support it and I hope everyone on the
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee will join me any further
 
05:12:42.830 --> 05:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Reynolds
 
05:12:44.570 --> 05:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:12:44.580 --> 05:12:45.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

05:12:45.490 --> 05:12:45.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:47.288 --> 05:12:47.298 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the
 
05:12:50.090 --> 05:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
trepidation expressed by
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
my two colleagues to your right
 
05:12:55.490 --> 05:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I am going to support the bill I'm
 
05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
glad we all seem to be supporting the
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill because in my view
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to enable
 
05:13:03.000 --> 05:13:04.190 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to enable
uh

05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:06.288 --> 05:13:06.298 align:start position:0%
the largest buyers of electricity in the
 
05:13:08.810 --> 05:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
state that is our three regulated
 
05:13:08.820 --> 05:13:10.190 align:start position:0%
state that is our three regulated
utilities

05:13:10.190 --> 05:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
to get into the business of Contracting
 
05:13:14.448 --> 05:13:14.458 align:start position:0%
over the long term
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
for renewable energy resources whose
 
05:13:20.810 --> 05:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
fuel cost is zero so
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
I don't share their concern uh
 
05:13:27.070 --> 05:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
that my colleagues expressed about
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
you know the past experiences and
 
05:13:32.330 --> 05:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts where contracts
 
05:13:33.590 --> 05:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
would be signed and then of course
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel prices would drop
 
05:13:39.770 --> 05:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
and saddle rate payers with uh you know
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
higher than Market costs the fuel costs
 
05:13:46.970 --> 05:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
of the renewable resources that I expect
 
05:13:49.250 --> 05:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
will benefit from this legislation are
 
05:13:49.260 --> 05:13:50.510 align:start position:0%
will benefit from this legislation are
zero

05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
zero
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
now and forever and so
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I expect the result of this
 
05:13:58.910 --> 05:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislation to be that we pull a lot
 
05:13:58.920 --> 05:14:00.190 align:start position:0%
legislation to be that we pull a lot
more

05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:14:02.510 --> 05:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
substantial sized renewable energy
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
resources into the supply
 
05:14:07.368 --> 05:14:07.378 align:start position:0%
for our New Hampshire rate payers to
 
05:14:09.650 --> 05:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
