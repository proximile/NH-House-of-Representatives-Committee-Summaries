which I would like to point out to you
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
is funded solely by the retirement
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
system it is does the monies do not come
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
from the general fund
 
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
the statutory administrative budget
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
encompasses all internal non-investment

budget biennially
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
our statutory administrative operating
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
budget for fiscal year 23 is 12.2
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars and our proposed budgets
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
for the next two years are slightly
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
higher at 13 million in fiscal year 24
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
and 13.6 million in fiscal year 25.
 
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
as you well know the New Hampshire
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
retirement system is not an executive
 
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
branch agency but is a statutorily
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
created pension trust although its
 
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
expenses flow through the state those
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
costs are reimbursed from the retirement
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
trust which is in turn funded by
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
contributions from employers and members
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
and investment returns
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
the budget which is before you today has
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
been fully vetted and adopted by our
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
before I go into greater detail on the
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
operations of the retirement system I'd
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
like to share these key facts about nhrs
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
nhrs provides a modest pension benefit
 
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
the average annual pension is just over
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
twenty one thousand eight hundred
 
00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:51.530 align:start position:0%
twenty one thousand eight hundred

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
nearly two-thirds of our forty two
 
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
thousand pension recipients receive less
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
than twenty five thousand dollars per
 
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
than twenty five thousand dollars per
year

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
and HRS benefits are funded by member
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
contributions employer contributions and
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
investment returns
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
nhrs Investments have achieved an
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
average annual net return of 8.5 percent
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
the benefits that nhrs pays help support
 
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
in the last fiscal year nhrs paid out
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
more than 900 million in pensions and 45
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%

just under 80 percent of retirees live
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and spend their
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
money here
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
according to research released last year
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
as everyone knows nhrs has a significant

unfunded Actuarial accrued liability
 
00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579 align:start position:0%
There are 16 years remaining on the
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
payoff of the original unfunded
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
liability which existed in 2007.
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
subsequent gains and losses occurring
 
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
after June 30 2017 are being amortized
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
over periods of no more than 20 years
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
on average roughly 80 percent of the
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rate for state
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
employees goes toward paying off the
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability
 
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.620 align:start position:0%

four membership classifications employee
 
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
teacher police and fire will decrease in
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24-25
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
the rate decreases primarily the result
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
of strong investment performance over
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
the five-year period ending June 30 2021
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
and those decreases in employer
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
contributions range from 3.75 percent to
 
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
8 percent
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
the trustees continue to strengthen the
 
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
plan by adopting revised Actuarial
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
assumptions recommended by the system's
 
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.250 align:start position:0%
assumptions recommended by the system's
actuaries

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:21.260 align:start position:0%
actuaries
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions were last revised
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
following a recent experience study for
 
00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
the period 2016 through through 2019 and
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
including a reduction in the assumed
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
rate of return from 7.25 percent to 6.75
 
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.630 align:start position:0%
rate of return from 7.25 percent to 6.75

percent
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
because of its strong constitutional and
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
statutory Foundation nhrs is on the path
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
to full funding the retirement system is
 
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
making good progress on paying down its
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
slow steady increase decrease in the
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
liability is projected in the coming
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
decades with a corresponding increase in
 
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.060 align:start position:0%
the funded ratio which is increased to
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
65.6 percent in fiscal year 2022 and
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
I'll take a couple of minutes to review
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
the highlights document and then talk
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%

database modifications as well as
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
training for our staff and our members
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
our funded ratio as I mentioned earlier
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
increased to 65.6 percent as of June 30
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
2022 and as you can see from the chart
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
below it's on it's trending favorably
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
although we did receive a negative
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
investment return
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2022 our performance
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
relative to our peers was still very
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
good and I think everyone can
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
acknowledge there were a lot of unique
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
factors in the most in the most recent
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
year that caused the depressed markets
 
00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:23.449 align:start position:0%
year that caused the depressed markets
internationally

00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
internationally
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
we issued our June 30 22 financial
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
statements with an unmodified or clean
 
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.949 align:start position:0%
statements with an unmodified or clean
opinion

00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
and we'll be doing an Actuarial
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
experience study in 2024 for the
 
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
four-year period ending June 30 2023
 
00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
this study will further the process of
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
assuring that the funding of the system
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
is in alignment with anticipated costs
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
for providing benefits and will also
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
ensure that all the assumptions that
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
underlie our Actuarial valuation are
 
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.269 align:start position:0%
underlie our Actuarial valuation are
accurate

00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
so far this year it's been a busy year
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
in the session 21 bills related to nhrs
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
have been introduced this session in
 
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
passage of any legislation related to
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
benefit eligibility or calculations this
 
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
year will delay the implementation of
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
our pension database upgrade and add to
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
our project's costs
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
the governor at nhrs's request has
 
00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
included a forty thousand dollar
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
appropriation in House Bill 2 to provide
 
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:32.060 align:start position:0%
long-term funding for a closed
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
non-pension Legacy benefit administered
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
by the retirement system for two widows
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
of coal fire fighters killed in the line
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
of duty so those were the key highlights
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to share with you and I
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
will now turn the floor over to Marie
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
Mullen our Director of Finance to walk
 
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:56.509 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
committee

00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
um for the Retirement Systems budget
 
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
we've provided a chart here that shows
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
our actual expenditures over the the
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
budget and um we left off the actual
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
expenditures I apologize for that but in
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
2022 our budget was 12.3 million our
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
actuals were 10.2 million so due to
 
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
vacancies and some other efficiencies we
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
were able to spend less than our budget
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
um so you can see over the years we've
 
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
tried to maintain a real a study budget
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
not we have a fiduciary responsibility
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
so we we try to be very efficient in
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and how we provide
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
services to the members and retirees
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the last page
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
this is our administrative budget as
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
presented during the agency phase and
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
then as the governor has presented in
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
his budget
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
um there was only one minor change
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
between our submission and the
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and that was in the
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
retiree Health Care line number 12 in in
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
our chart here there was a slight
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
reduction in the retiree health care
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
costs that were provided
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
um for our salaries and benefits we are
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
we did see an increase over the FY 23
 
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and that's related
 
00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and that's related
to

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
um the negotiated increases we have a
 
00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:21.059 align:start position:0%
separate Union from the the state so our
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
um negotiated increases were done we
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
have a three-year contract prior to us
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
submitting the budget
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
so we had a 4.7
 
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
4.75 salary increase in 24 and a 4.5
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
um our technology and software Hardware
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
lines you can see we we have an increase
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
there that is due to the increased risk
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
related to cyber security we are trying
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
to shore up our our cyber security and
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
also we have a significant server
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
replacement coming up in in fiscal year
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
25 that we need to fund as well
 
00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
and then one of the the larger lines on
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
here is related to our pension gold
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
project that executive director Jan has
 
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
the cost there we anticipate going live
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24 there will be some
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
residual enhancements and then ongoing
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs for that so we have
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
included the the pension software the
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
cost for that for the upgrade the
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance in our budget for 24 and 25
 
00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:28.310 align:start position:0%
maintenance in our budget for 24 and 25
there

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll upon that I'll leave it
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
open to any questions for the members of
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire followed by
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin uh thank you Mr
 
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.710 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin uh thank you Mr
chairman

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
um just basically do you have roughly a
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
hundred employees is that my guess 77 77
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
okay and and how many are actual and how
 
00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:50.930 align:start position:0%
okay and and how many are actual and how
many

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
um are authorized
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh all of ours are authorized
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
no no you said you were missing some
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's why you didn't spend as much
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
well it's it's just turnover I should
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
say it's turnover during the year so you
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
have a few months where you're until you
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
bring someone in so you have savings
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
right you're not spending the salaries
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
and benefits while you have a vacancy
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
but all of ours are authorized we have
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
two vacancies currently right now we
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're constantly filling those
 
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
um so it's very minor but yeah very
 
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.350 align:start position:0%
um so it's very minor but yeah very
minor

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
minor
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
may ask something else yeah thank you so
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
um this hardware and software line four
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
of the little handout says
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
um the we're going to spend
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
um 1.1 1.2 million per year but in the
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
budget itself if you look at a line page
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
181 line 37 and 38. that's more like 200
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
and 2.8 2.9 kind of number yeah we've
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
broken that out so we have the the
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
technology and software Hardware related
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
to our ongoing like operations and
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
maintenance and then we broke out some
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
of that hardware and software into the
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
pension gold that what is specific to
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
that project so that's why you don't see
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
all of it in line four a large portion
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
of that is related to the the pension
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
gold software upgrade so we've included
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
sure so this and so our schedule in
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
online 18 also includes the salaries and
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
benefits and and other miscellaneous
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
costs related to that project
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
oh I see so that's why I knew that the
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
sum is either too big or too little
 
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:42.419 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay but overall the total
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
matches the the total budget now is this
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
project something that's going to end so
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
we would expect line 18 to to disappear
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
at some point there will still be
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance and warranty costs
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
related to it but the the Consulting and
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
some of the the initial costs will will
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
reduce it won't be at this level going
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
into the future but currently while
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of we have the
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
Consulting costs and um that but there
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
will be ongoing maintenance costs after
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
that and warranty
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I had a
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
two-part question but half of it's been
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
answered the number of employees
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
are those employees part of the New
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system yes they are
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here today
 
00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned in an answer to another
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
question that there's limited vacancies
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
that take place throughout the year so
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
just what is driving the overtime
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh expenditures so if if there's not
 
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
frequent vacancies uh vacancies what's
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:03.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
um we the overtime is a call is caused
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
by numerous factors one factor is the
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
vacancies that happen periodically the
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
work still needs to get done even though
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
the person who is primarily responsible
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
for the work is not there
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
um there's also been because of the
 
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
software project there's a significant
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
amount of testing that needs to get done
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
as the different pieces get the
 
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
different the Liberals deliverables get
 
00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:39.419 align:start position:0%
rolled out they have to get tested and
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
so that is in addition to our staff's
 
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
regular duties
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
and then there's also certain times of
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
the year that are just simply busier
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
than others for example
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
in the months cup preceding July which
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
is when we have the most retirements
 
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.299 align:start position:0%
with all of the teachers retiring
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of member services over
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
time and then in the months of October
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
and November in finance because of our
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
external audit there's a lot of overtime
 
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
there and so if Marie has any other
 
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:32.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
foreign

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
T are you working with them at all
 
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
doit yeah no we have our separate
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
because we're a component unit of the
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
state we have a separate I.T department
 
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
so all of our infrastructure everything
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.529 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:57.539 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt what's up
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
you have one more
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
I can generate as many questions all
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
right so we heard that um there's 42 000
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
recipients of Pensions right now there's
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
how many active employees are there
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand maybe it's a 48
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right and um
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat of an aside but
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
something that brought up yesterday
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
could we find out
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
um for each of the four categories of
 
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
employees employee teacher police fire
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
um roughly take a year like 2000 how
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
many started versus how many
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
um became vested
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean how steep is that
 
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.690 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean how steep is that
funnel

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
funnel
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
because that would be an interesting
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
thing to know and I haven't been able to
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
to get that data yet so
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
um if you want to do it for more than
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
one year that's fine I don't care but
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
you know just a rough
 
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay we can take a look at that all
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions I do have a
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
question from Marty and if you were able
 
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
to come up with that analysis of that 50
 
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.490 align:start position:0%
to come up with that analysis of that 50
million

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
all right that's great thanks that's all
 
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
I have representative Weiler
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I've noted quite a bit of turnover in
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
in this agency I remember Marie was
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
D.O.T was it just a year or two ago and
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
how long have you been with him
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
I've on April 1st I will mark my second
 
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.210 align:start position:0%
I've on April 1st I will mark my second
anniversary

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
anniversary
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
congratulations where did you come from
 
00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:58.100 align:start position:0%
um New Mexico
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
I remember we've always drawn from all
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
over the country I remember previously
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
was Kentucky or something like that or
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
that the person didn't last long so I I
 
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
see quite a bit of turnover is that
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
um it has
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
been largely at the upper levels but a
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
lot of it had was planned in advance for
 
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
example my predecessor George Legos he
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
had he had his retirement
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
um in addition
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
um Larry Johansen who had been our
 
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.370 align:start position:0%
um Larry Johansen who had been our
um

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
director of Investments had he had been
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
in that position for over 10 years 13
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
years and he also had a planned
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
retirement we've also had other staff
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
members leave for better opportunities
 
00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:48.299 align:start position:0%
elsewhere it's been a combination of
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
things but I want you to know we have
 
00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to bring in new
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly qualified
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
replacements for the vacancies that
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
we've had and we're we've become a
 
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.230 align:start position:0%
we've had and we're we've become a
stronger

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
stronger
 
00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:05.539 align:start position:0%
Agency for it I mean
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
Marie is just an example of one of the
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
the new members of senior staff and
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
she's a very strong professional yeah
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
she she comes with a reputation we all
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
know that she knows all the numbers so
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
anyway we're delighted that she's there
 
00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:22.610 align:start position:0%
anyway we're delighted that she's there
but

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know it it also seems there's a
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
great deal of fluctuation in the
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
earnings of this fund I've never been
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
satisfied with who we have advising
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
for three or four years because I have
 
00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
my own funds and I'm looking at them and
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
they do a little up and down but not as
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
much as this the funds in this agency
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
from plus 26 percent one year to minus
 
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
six the next year and I don't see that
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
happening and the other funds is as much
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
and wonder about the mixture of funds
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
and and why it's so
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
you know variable and and we had several
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
years where it was down around one
 
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.090 align:start position:0%
years where it was down around one
percent

00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
percent
so

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm doubtful about the advice you
 
00:28:03.539 --> 00:28:04.430 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm doubtful about the advice you
have

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you well I I would like to
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
point out that in the 13 years that
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
we've had the independent investment
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee our performance has been very
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
strong relative to our peers and yes
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
there can be very significant
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in return from one year to
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
the next but that is what's happening
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the financial markets it's
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much you did steal a
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
very good person from the D.O.T I know
 
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
they'd miss her over there so
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
um anyway see no further questions it
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
would appear that we're satisfied with
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
what you've offered again just a caution
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
as you may have heard me say earlier to
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
the division that we may have to have
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
you back should we find ourselves in
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
some sort of issue but I don't see that
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
happening here
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh and you did ask great questions one
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
of the most important things we do look
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
at is general fund dollars uh that's and
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
as she mentioned there are no general
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
fund dollars here we'll find with
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
insurance next or no general fund
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
dollars but that's not always the case
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
but those are the some of the important
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
issues well thank you very much Marty
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
we'll look forward to your email
 
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.870 align:start position:0%
we'll look forward to your email
Maybe

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
so next we have insurance
 
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.710 align:start position:0%
so next we have insurance
um

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
like to just give you three or four
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
minutes about what we do at the
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
insurance department uh I think most of
 
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
you have heard from us before
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
um but it's important to understand that
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department was
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
the first insurance department in the
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
United States uh for an industry that is
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
primarily state-based uh regulation New
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was on The Cutting Edge of
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
that nearly a hundred and fifty years
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
ago 170 years ago 170 years ago we did
 
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
that uh we are our uh the commission is
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
charged with enforcing all insurance
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
laws which can be found in New Hampshire
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
between RSA 400 and 420 Q
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh and those uh those regulations
 
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
include the collection of Premium tax
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
fees the regulation of all insurance
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
companies in New Hampshire we have 1300
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
insurance companies 1300 companies that
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
are authorized to sell policies here uh
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
and nearly 200 000 Insurance Producers
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
or adjusters licensed to do business
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire uh residents we
 
00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:42.230 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire uh residents we
approve

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
um we approve licenses for all of those
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
folks when you get down to it the
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
mission of the insurance department can
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
be boiled down to Consumer Protection we
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
do that in five major ways first we
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
approve rates for every Insurance
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
product sold in the state and so when a
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
company uh proposes to sell a product
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
here we look at their rate and we
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
determine one of uh two things one that
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
it is not artificially high that they're
 
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
not charging more than necessary to pay
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
the claims but also that it's not
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
artificially low what we don't want a
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
company to do is come to New Hampshire
 
00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:15.419 align:start position:0%
buy market share by pricing their
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
product too low uh thereby leaving in a
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
situation where they have inadequate
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
reserves to pay claims so that's the
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
first thing we do we also have a team of
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
people that approve every form every
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
document that you get related to your
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
insurance policy is reviewed by our team
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
and they're looking at it for compliance
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
with state law federal law where
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
applicable and a Centrist and so as they
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
go through those if they see some new
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
Innovative language a creative language
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
they'll bring it to our team and say is
 
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
this okay and we'll review that and
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
we'll make a decision based on what's
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
best for consumers and then ultimately
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
we'll change the law of the rule to make
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
sure that that's outlined for everyone
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh a third uh a kind of uh leg to our
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
consumer protection stool is our
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
financial stability and accuracy reviews
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
we have a team that reviews every
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
Financial record of companies here to do
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
business to make sure that they're
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
adequately and appropriately disclosing
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
their Investments their assets uh their
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
reserves so that we are not surprised
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
when an insurance company be becomes
 
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
financially challenged
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh most importantly the thing that we do
 
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
is we serve New Hampshire consumers we
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
have a team of seven people that assist
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and I uh to work with
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consumers in an almost 5
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
000 consumer increase a year come into
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
our department uh we manage those the
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
vast majority of them something like 80
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
percent are just increase it we can
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
answer because we're experts it might be
 
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
what's actual cash value mean what's
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
this provision in my contract mean how
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
do I know if my car is totaled uh but 20
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
of those turn into consumer
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
investigations where we uh will work
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
with the company we'll work with the
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
licensees we'll work with the producers
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not any law was
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh violated that they complied with Fair
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
settlement procedures
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and ultimately direct the New
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumer to understand what is
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
happening in their insurance transaction
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're proud of that work we could
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
probably spend this whole half an hour
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
talking about the great work we do there
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
and finally we have a team that does
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
targeted and random exams on insurance
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
companies to look at whether or not
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
they're complying with our laws so we
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
may go in and look at a health carrier
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
and see are they paying claims in a
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
timely manner are they processing claims
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
in accordance with their underlying
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
policies so all of that work uh and the
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
75 to 85 staff people that we have on
 
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:40.220 align:start position:0%
our team
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
that manage that
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department is a
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
self-funded department so our budget uh
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
39 million dollars will be uh the
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
numerator in a in a formula where the
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
total assessment I'm sorry total premium
 
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
volume for the state in Hampshire is the
 
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:01.820 align:start position:0%
denominator and so it's about
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
.001 of a percent of insurance premium
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's funded for our department uh so
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
the entities that we regulate pay for
 
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
um I know most of this today will be
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
about our spending but it's important to
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
talk about what we do for collecting
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
general fund Revenue uh we collect
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
nearly 140 million dollars a year in
 
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
revenue for the State uh 125 million of
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
that is insurance premium tax we charge
 
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.050 align:start position:0%
that is insurance premium tax we charge
uh

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
sales tax of one and a half percent to
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
two percent on insurance policies in the
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
state it is much much more complicated
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
than that and to explain all of that to
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
you would take several hours but assured
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
that every policy sold here is taxed at
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
at least our rate uh or at the higher
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
rate of what the uh uh State
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
um the home state of the insurance
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
company would charge our uh company if
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
they were taxed we collect five million
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
dollars in circle science tax those are
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
taxes on policies from insurance
 
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
companies that aren't regulated directly
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
by our market and those are for products
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
that are difficult to place
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
and then finally we collect uh somewhere
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood of 19 million
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in fees
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh to our budget in large part our
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
budget isn't going to be surprisingly
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
different from what you've seen uh in
 
00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
the past there are some changes we're
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
coming out of covid uh we're doing some
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
strategic planning and in large part
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
about 90 of our budget is uh
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
non-negotiable for us it's things like
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits uh DOI T costs
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
rent costs pensions and and such
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh this year uh we are asking for three
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
new uh junior examiner positions and
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
that is uh because we are aware we are
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
well aware that our department is older
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
than average you know I think state
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
employees are generally older than uh
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
private sector uh folks and our
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
department is especially so and what
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
we're seeing as a
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
a team is that we're losing deep
 
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
knowledge bases as people retire and
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is to ensure that we
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
continue to have those resources
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
in-house we need the ability to bring on
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
some Junior examiners that we can train
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
up in the coming years so that we don't
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
lose that knowledge what we've seen
 
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
happen in other states that have already
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
gone through this transition is if they
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
are not proactive about it what they end
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
up with is no team left they don't have
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
a team of insurance company examiners on
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
their staff left to sufficiently cover
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
their work
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
their only answer then is to hire
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
outside Consultants outside Consultants
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
that do this same work charge on average
 
00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:38.060 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars a day for that work
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
by training the team in-house here we
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
maintain and retain that asset for the
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire so that we have
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
those people here it is a critical part
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
of ensuring that my department and our
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
department is ready for the next
 
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
Generation I believe in two or three
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles I will come back and be
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
able to ask to reduce remove three
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
positions after I'd adequately trained
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
and brought on those new folks and
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
turned over the people that are looking
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
to leave then I may not need those but I
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate for about three years will
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry three budgets will need to run
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
those through the the whole operation
 
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.339 align:start position:0%
I think there are 38 of our staff that
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
are insurance company examiners of some
 
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.750 align:start position:0%
are insurance company examiners of some
sort

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
sort
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
48 sorry 48 that was close uh 48 of our
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
team that are insurance company
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
examiners and so those will be run
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
through all the divisions
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
a couple other changes that are in our
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
budget uh that you might notice uh line
 
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
10 which is our general kind of office
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
expenses line that's where we buy our
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
paper and toner and uh ergonomic uh
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
necessary equipment and we're raising
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
that from 110 to 135 that's kind of a
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
catch-all for us
 
00:38:52.089 --> 00:38:52.099 align:start position:0%
um on line 26 Do's
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
we pay dues to the NAIC the NAIC is a
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
group a National Association of
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
insurance Commissioners every state and
 
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.020 align:start position:0%
all the territories belong to the NAIC
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh in the NAIC is as the name says
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
insurance commission a group of
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
insurance Commissioners they pull
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
resources for us and uh for the dues we
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
pay them they return about a hundred
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
times back to us
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
what they do for a state like New
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mentioned earlier that we
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
have 200 000 licensees NAIC processes
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
all of those and so instead of us having
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
to receive a paper application and a
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
check and process it in the computer and
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
verify that they've checked all the
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
right boxes and then add it to our
 
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
accounting and ASC does that for us
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
every day sends us a report of uh who's
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
updated their licenses and a check on
 
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.170 align:start position:0%
updated their licenses and a check on
EFT

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
EFT
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
um that alone probably saves us 300 000
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
a year and they do that time and time
 
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
again for resources that all of the
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners Across the Nation need uh
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
and so it's a tremendous resource the
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
increase in the dues this year is we
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
have not for the last two budgets
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
um funded are end coil position and end
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
coil is the national
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh committee for insurance legislators
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
and this is a resource for
 
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
um for State reps that are in that are
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
dealing with insurance issues to do the
 
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
same thing I'm doing at uh NAIC uh this
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
is something that a couple of State reps
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
have asked me about attending those
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
meetings so that they can go and be uh
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
be enlightened on what's Happening
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation and so the increase
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
here of fifteen thousand dollars is so
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
that we can fund the end coil uh dues
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh equipment line 30. um it's probably
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
presented wise probably our largest
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
increase we're going from 40 to 107. uh
 
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years the department has
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
neglected to replace either of our two
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
vehicles and so we are now 10 years in
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
since we bought our last car
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
we use cars primary State business but
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
almost exclusively for our three fraud
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
investigators we have fraud
 
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
investigators under statute we're
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
required to investigate any referred
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
fraud to the state we investigate those
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
all over and because that takes a a toll
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
on the cars we provide cars at the
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
department for that we should have done
 
00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%
this four years ago and two years ago
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
but with covet in the tight budget we
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
put it off uh it is it is time and so
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
um line 46 line 46 and line 102 are our
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
consultant and program Services we think
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
of those two lines together uh we are
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
bringing those lines back to
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels uh a lot of our
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
external programming is run through
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
these lines namely
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
um healthcost.gov New Hampshire has the
 
00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
first and best
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
health cost website in the nation
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
several states have copied us we've been
 
00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
doing it for 15 years we collect
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
millions of lines of Health cost data
 
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
and make that available to Consumers we
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
do some of that in conjunction with DHHS
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
and so some of these contracted services
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
are supporting the database the analysis
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
uh and the reporting of that
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh these two lines combined also cover
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
our required annual hearing every year
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
we have a comprehensive hearing for all
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
people interested in health insurance to
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
explain what's happening in our
 
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that costs us about ninety
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to have the Consultants
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh dig into all of the state and
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
National factors impacting health
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
insurance so that we as a department and
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh the industry as a whole understand
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
what's happening there
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh and we're bringing those back to
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
you'll notice in line 50 we have a temp
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
employee as part of the discussion that
 
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
we've had I've had with you today about
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
the turnover of our office we've used
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
this temporary employee line uh in
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
almost the entire time admin
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner which is now three in two
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
weeks I'll be commissioner three years
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
in a row uh three years now and we've
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
used that line almost entirely to
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
backfill when somebody surprises us with
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
I'm retiring we hire somebody new and we
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
use this temp position so that we can
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
bring them back to train for key
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
functions in their Department uh one of
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
them that we've used a couple of times
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
is our company licensing person it's a
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
very difficult job and we've had a
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
little bit of turnover there and we've
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
brought back a woman who's done that job
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
for uh for a career to train two people
 
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.109 align:start position:0%
for uh for a career to train two people
now

00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
I actually I'm sorry three people uh and
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
currently we're using it to help us get
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
through the legislative session we had
 
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.430 align:start position:0%
through the legislative session we had
the

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
distinct opportunity to bring back our
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
former uh Deputy Commissioner Alex
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
valdable to help us do a legislative
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
session he is a uh he is a wealth of
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge and we lost uh our head of
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
life and health last year and he's
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
helping us hobble through so this uh
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
temporary employee line we will use
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately to make sure that we
 
00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:08.180 align:start position:0%
continue delivering services
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
employee training there's a small
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
increase and that is driven
 
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
um by a training that didn't happen over
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we weren't able to travel
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
to some of our required credential
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
training for our teams and we need to
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
pick that back up and make sure that
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
they stay at the top of the game
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh and then finally
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
um the promotional line which is line 69
 
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
is an increase from 35 to 60. uh that
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
increase if you need a lot of detail uh
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner or bet Court will
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
give it to you but this is our effort to
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
continue to make sure New Hampshire
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
consumers know we're here we have a lot
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
of resources and the the worst thing we
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
hear is I didn't know about you when I
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
needed you and so we have a
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
comprehensive program to get out DJ and
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
his team are running that and I'm sure
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
he'd be happy to go into more detail if
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
you have questions but other than that
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any questions on
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%

um on page 319 you're getting uh for one
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
year only half a million dollars from
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
the federal government for Consultants
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
what is that about
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
um that that is uh what's the name of
 
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.230 align:start position:0%
um that that is uh what's the name of
that

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
State Flex Grant uh it's a number of
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
programs coming from the federal
 
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
government to research and investigate
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
uh things that are changing our health
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
insurance uh landscape here in New
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a very rigid program
 
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
where we're able to look at certain
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
aspects of cost drivers for health
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
insurance we are preparing now uh to put
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
out rfps for that money it will look at
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
things like the total impact of mandates
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
and other cost drivers right now we're
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
looking at a pretty substantive shift as
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
part of our Medicaid redetermination
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to be happening in the
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
coming weeks so it'll be used for
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
long-term research projects directed by
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh federal government
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
um What's the total amount spent on
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
insurance in New Hampshire and and and
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
in each category I mean Auto and
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
homeowners and whatever General that's
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
an awesome question it's one I like to I
 
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
generally like to ask people as a trivia
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
question uh it is uh almost seven
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh seven billion dollars in insurance
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
and it's roughly I have a chart here
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
roughly three billion 3 billion and one
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
billion being PNC health and then other
 
00:46:37.859 --> 00:46:39.770 align:start position:0%
billion being PNC health and then other
products

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
I thought I had a chart here honestly so
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
your 0.001 I think is actually 0.2
 
00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:46.849 align:start position:0%
your 0.001 I think is actually 0.2
percent

00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
because you're spending 14 million out
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
of 7 billion
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
so a percent of 7 billion would be
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
um 70 million right and so you're 0.2 of
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
that I I guess you're right okay um I
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
think I think part of that factor is
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
that last year we returned almost 2
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
million of that money uh and the neic
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
provides us that calculation as a
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
compare all of our states together and I
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
they may be capturing uh products that
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
aren't regulated here
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
one last question so how many new
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
companies who haven't previously done
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
work in new sold Insurance in New
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have come in in the last
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
couple of years I Pro another great
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
question I probably signed a new license
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
once a week you know it's a very active
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
very active in part they're not they're
 
00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
not entirely new companies you know it's
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
a division of Geico that is you know
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
rolling out a new product here there are
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
some new companies as they go across the
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
nation you know one of the facts that I
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
like to share to you know so that my own
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
britches don't get too big is that the
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Marketplace the insurance
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that we regulate is 0.4 of a
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
percent less than half a percent of the
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
Nationwide Marketplace that's our
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
population and so people aren't sitting
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
in New York or Hartford saying you know
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
what we need to do we need to break into
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire like that is the market uh
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
and the way we do that the way we
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
attract folks is having a a in a
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
business approach that Embraces them and
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
encourages them to come here and to
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
allow them to appropriately rate
 
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.290 align:start position:0%
allow them to appropriately rate
policies

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh and that's why almost all of our
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
markets are what we consider competitive
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
markets there are lots of companies
 
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
willing to write your risk namely the
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
only one that's currently not
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
competitive is medical malpractice
 
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:37.849 align:start position:0%
competitive is medical malpractice
insurance

00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
being here to take questions from us
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned adding three employees
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
for the the junior program uh lines 10
 
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
and 11 almost when combined for what was
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
authorized in 2023 and what's proposed
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
for 2024 seemed to be pretty even so I'm
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are other Staffing
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
reductions that are in this budget or
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
movements in order to get to those three
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh that was astute of you uh to see that
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
the junior examiner positions are would
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
be some of our lowest paid positions so
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
they're not substantial positions and
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
also part of this transition iPad where
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
my senior staff is retiring and being
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
replaced with people is offsetting that
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
um I think we will see that because they
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
didn't they don't earn a whole bunch and
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
there's only three that's what it is
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
I've set by one follow-up
 
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
um sort of separate subject are you are
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
we seeing an increase in Insurance scams
 
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
along the lines of every other scam that
 
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
seems to be increasing yeah your
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
department interacts with and deals with
 
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
yes okay and where New Hampshire has
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
taken a very proactive approach on this
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
we were the first to go after or
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
the First Health sharing Ministry his
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
name alternative Trinity and alert we're
 
00:50:01.609 --> 00:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
the first state in the nation to do that
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
we were the first state in the nation to
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
look at uh mental health parity uh we
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
today signed a settlement agreement with
 
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
another Health sharing scam Jericho and
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
so we're watching those very closely and
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
when we get a settlement so we get in
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
early before the company has roots here
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
so we can get them out
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh and we and if they don't agree to
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
leave we will find them we're taking
 
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
that very seriously yeah one thing I
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
would highlight along with that and it's
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
a bit of a frustration so take this as a
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
bit of a PSA we're seeing a lot of
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
complaints coming in with regard to the
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
sale and promotion of Medicare Advantage
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
and the problem that we have there is we
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
do not have authority over Medicare
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
Advantage the State lost its oversight
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
of that function of that program with
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
the Medicare modernization act back in
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
the early 2000s we do our best and we
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
direct consumers to the federal process
 
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
to get their issues addressed but what I
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
can tell you is
 
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.809 align:start position:0%
can tell you is
um

00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
I admire people like Joe Namath and
 
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
William Shatner but don't take your
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage advice from them
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
um start there and and if it sounds
 
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
fishy it probably is fishy and they're
 
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.670 align:start position:0%
fishy it probably is fishy and they're
using

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
um third-party offshore
 
00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:23.099 align:start position:0%
call centers to really harass people
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it's bad we have a um a guy in our
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
department who tried to do a little
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
undercover work and tried to get through
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
the system so he could figure out who
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
they were rooting people to and we were
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
trying to see if we could somehow get at
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
this by getting directed to a New
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license he was using these
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
call centers when they're not licensed
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
to sell or solicit insurance we weren't
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
successful but what it did do is it
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
rendered his phone practically useless
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
it just rang all day because the word
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
went out that we may have a live one
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
here and everybody just swarmed in so
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
that's another really big one in
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
frustrating one that we've been seeing
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
and while we're here in front of you
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
because this is such a critical issue
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
for us if in your uh if in your uh
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
communities you're hearing about this or
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity for one of our
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
experts to come out and educate folks
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
reach out to us we DJ and I have done
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
Road shows in Pizza Halls rotary uh
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
Chambers of Commerce we have an expert
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
that can do that for different groups
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to because it's just
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to educate people
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
about some of these Bad actors
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative Cambridge
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the and thank you for
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
being here for explaining what you guys
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
do because I I frankly didn't know that
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
it even existed
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the effective
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of your department in
 
00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
protecting the New Hampshire consumer
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
how's your record look in terms of uh
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
companies that may have folded because
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
you say you audit them to protect uh
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
what's the record look like in the past
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
few years in terms of companies that
 
00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
have folded and left our people high and
 
00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:09.059 align:start position:0%
dry uh well last few years Euro the last
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
major insolvency uh was 1998.
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
now the the only caveat to that is one
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
of the health insurers 10 years ago
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
um wrapped up but health insurance isn't
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
exactly like regular Insurance
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
um none and it's in part because the
 
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
we're not doing it alone and so the way
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
these Financial exams work are your key
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
State the state that you are domiciled
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
in kind of heads in exam but you do it
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with all of the other
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
states or many of the other states where
 
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
they write business and then our
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
analysis the way we examine them is
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
examined by Auditors to make sure we're
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
getting it right because it is so
 
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.829 align:start position:0%
getting it right because it is so
critical

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh and what we see is states that are
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
good at our job and we are we are the
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
best at our financial
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
um analysis our financial analysis team
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
is the best we lit they literally take
 
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
our team members to teach the rest of
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
the this the nation
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
um companies that are questionable don't
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
come here
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
if you want to do something Suspect with
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
the reserves you're not coming to a
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
and I would just add in terms of
 
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
consumer satisfaction we are required by
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
Statute to survey the consumers that we
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
interact with to make sure that we're
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
hitting some quality metrics and we've
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
taken that very very aggressively we
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
actually have an individual who
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
individually calls every consumer that
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
our consumer division touches and when
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
we started this I was a little bit
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
nervous because you know it tends to be
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
the case that the consumer who you're
 
00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
able to successfully help them with
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
their issue they're going to be happy
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
with you whereas the consumer who comes
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
to you and we have to tell them look
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
you're in an erisa plan that's Federal
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's a federal program
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
you've got to go to the feds are
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
probably not as happy or somebody who
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
comes to us and there's no regulatory
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
violation by the company
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
probably not happy with us what I was
 
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
thrilled about is that the approval
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
rating the satisfaction rating of
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
consumers that respond to us is 90
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not their case
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
was handled the way they wanted it to be
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
handled or not uh which
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm very proud of it means that our
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
team is knowledgeable they're respectful
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
and they're getting back to people in a
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
timely manner regardless of how the
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
I have a few questions or representative
 
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
I have a few questions or representative
Weiler

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman welcome DJ good to
 
00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
see you I'm looking for where dues are
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the budget I used to be a
 
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.490 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the budget I used to be a
required

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
thing and they don't I don't see a line
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
that says dues
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
it's my expenditure line 26 I am looking
 
00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
at a different printout than you have
 
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.430 align:start position:0%
at a different printout than you have
um

00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
all right found it thank you and one of
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
the other questions I have if I may
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
is the uh is one particular
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
automobile repair shop and always
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
complains to me and I'm sure to you
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
about unfair treatment that if
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
this Chevrolet was being repaired at the
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
Chevrolet agency no questions pay it but
 
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:35.420 align:start position:0%
when he wants to to
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
repair it you don't approve the same
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
level of
 
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:42.020 align:start position:0%
of payment
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
well first off representative we don't
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
approve we don't approve repair
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
estimates uh there there is a process in
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law for how uh two types
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
of repair shops deal with uh authorized
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
repairs uh there's something called a
 
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
in-network shop somebody who has a
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
pre-existing kind of pre-agreed to
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
arrangement with uh insurance carriers
 
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
and they could have them with several
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then there are independent shops uh
 
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
independent shops likely are the ones
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
who are making a call like this to you
 
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a pre-existing
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
relationship and so they have to
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
negotiate what their repair would be
 
00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
because because in New Hampshire
 
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
Insurance consumer is able to go to
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
whatever repair shop they choose they
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
cannot be directed to a contracted shop
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
they get a chance to go to somebody
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
who's not in network we need to have
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
Direction in our law that says how
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to get paid back and the
 
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
direction that New Hampshire has adopted
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
is independent shop gives a quote
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
insurance company thinks that it's not
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
Market they go to another independent
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
shop get a competing quote from another
 
00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
shop who isn't a network and that would
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
the higher of them prevails
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
um it's not a perfect system we do
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
handle lots of those calls I would
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
encourage this person to call our team
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
call DJ and we'll work with them but
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
it's you know uh
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
we don't decide what the reimbursement
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
rates are
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
you mentioned settlements and stuff do
 
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
you work with the AG's office at all or
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
are you sort of a what's the overlap
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
there so our team they are not um sworn
 
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
officers so our Three Investigators on
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
our fraud team investigate potential
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
fraud put together a package that that
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
might outline fraud and then we turn
 
00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
that over to a prosecutor either Federal
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
prosecutor or County prosecutor
 
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
typically not the AG
 
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
um and for our for the enforcement or
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
Market conduct stuff and that's for our
 
00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
licensees people who are violating our
 
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
law who are regulated by our department
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
we do that internally
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
um we do work with AGS we fund a
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
position at the AGS to help our
 
00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.450 align:start position:0%
position at the AGS to help our
department

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
um but we
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
there's kind of separate tracks the
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
criminal track that they might would be
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
so I have a couple of questions uh I see
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
that last the last actual budget was
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
about 11 million dollars in round
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
numbers and under your proposed
 
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:27.140 align:start position:0%
Governors it's gone up to about 14
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars is that going to require
 
00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
any sort of fee increases like the
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax or uh I think uh
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
the actual expenses for 22 were 11
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
million the actual authorized budget for
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
uh for 23 was in fact 13.2 and so the
 
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
increase is 800 000 or so between what
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
the governor has and what our last
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
year's authorized budget was that will
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
mean the assessment to insurance
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
companies will go up
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
whatever that eight hundred thousand
 
00:59:58.799 --> 01:00:00.170 align:start position:0%
whatever that eight hundred thousand
dollars

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
um they uh the companies are very
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
supportive of the department keeping our
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
expertise in-house they understand that
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
it is far cheaper for me to train and
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
keep my insurance company examiners on
 
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
staff rather than use outside
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
Consultants uh and so I think to the
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
extent that you would hear from them
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
they would be uh more than supportive of
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
this number
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
so as far as a percentage what kind of
 
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
an increase because again I'm just
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
looking now at the uh actual expenses I
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
know you were authorized
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
said six percent six percent I I'm doing
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
that in my head so
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
or nine hundred over thirteen two
 
01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:46.619 align:start position:0%
so looking at uh travel I think that was
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
what fifteen thousand and now you're
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
looking for the recommendation 24 of up
 
01:00:54.289 --> 01:00:54.299 align:start position:0%
to 63
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
000. seems like a pretty substantial
 
01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.609 align:start position:0%
000. seems like a pretty substantial
increase

01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
uh I believe uh ins uh out of state
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
travel I believe is going from 50
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
authorized in 23 to 63. uh the 15 which
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
was our actual 4 22 was because uh in
 
01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:13.579 align:start position:0%
part we didn't travel a lot during covet
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
and uh in part because as part of our
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
dues from NAIC that I mentioned earlier
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
they provide uh one they fund me to to
 
01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:24.059 align:start position:0%
travel to those meetings and they also
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
provide 20 000 a year to offset uh
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
educational travel for our staff which
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
we didn't use in 20 and 21 and so we had
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
a big pool with them
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
to use which we used uh which we used
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
last year and so given free money from
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
NAIC or State uh State authorized
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue I use the free money first that
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
money is gone we used all of the backlog
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
of that money we will have 20 000 in
 
01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:51.059 align:start position:0%
next year's budget just like we always
 
01:01:51.059 --> 01:01:52.609 align:start position:0%
next year's budget just like we always
do

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:01:52.619 --> 01:01:55.849 align:start position:0%
do
um right

01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly again you don't use any
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
general funds but I always get concerned
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
that we say we're just going to pass it
 
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
on to the insurance companies which pass
 
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
it on to the consumer
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
we understand that and it's you know
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about 48 insurance
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
company uh Market examiners these are
 
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
these are top-notch experts in their
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
field and there are there is some
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
training that's required to keep them
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
um kind of up to speed on financial
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
accounting and Market conduct
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
examinations when you divide that over
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
the whole team it's it's probably one
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
so when you make those adjustments you
 
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
have to notify anyone in the legislature
 
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
or that you're bringing their rates up
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
by six percent or you do that and
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
hopefully nobody brings it to anybody's
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
attention we're doing that here yeah
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and and it is not bringing it up by
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
six percent if you ultimately if you
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
tell me we can't bring Junior examiners
 
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
on and we can't fund all your positions
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
um we will be forced to use Consultants
 
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
which get billed directly to the
 
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
companies outside of the budget so the
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
company the Consultants work they build
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
the company's hundreds of thousands and
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come through our budget the
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
companies are not better off now I
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
remember your predecessor used to like
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
to use Consultants uh he had a different
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
view of the value of the team the the
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
asset that I'm protecting is insurance
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
commissioner consumers first but the
 
01:03:29.089 --> 01:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
experts on my team second there is
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
somebody when when one of you calls me
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
and says I have a consumer who's in
 
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:33.710 align:start position:0%
and says I have a consumer who's in
trouble

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
I take my phone and I walk to that
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
expert as we're talking you're telling
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
me the story I walk in and depending on
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
who your issue what your issue is I get
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
to their office I hit speakerphone I
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
restate the issue to understand that I
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
got it right and they tell you the
 
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.650 align:start position:0%
got it right and they tell you the
answer

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
and that's worth what we're using it
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
just is
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
all right any further questions
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you did the
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
pandemic put any life insurers on the
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
ropes or cause them to leave the
 
01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:04.549 align:start position:0%
ropes or cause them to leave the
business

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:06.059 align:start position:0%
did not and we were really concerned
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
about that uh really really concerned
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
about the impact of the pandemic on a
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
lot of insurance you know initially
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
nobody's drove cars and then we were
 
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
worried about increased deaths
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think there was some impact
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
there and they're not not substantive it
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
did not change anybody's solvency I
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
think there are some aspects of it that
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
it may have helped you know if if people
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
no longer run long-term care insurance
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
because they they passed away
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
um it it kind of evened out uh they they
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
account for
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
um over the course of a relationship
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
with an insured uh for accruing for that
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
and said no
 
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.990 align:start position:0%
and said no
thanks

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.069 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
Weiler

01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
you're unclassified uh positions seem a
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
fairly high percentage is it a special
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
class that then includes uh we have a
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
lot of unclassified positions nearly 20
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
of my staff are unclassified is that
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
right and it may actually be slightly
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
more than that and it's because we have
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
a really broken record we have a lot of
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
experts you know
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
um we've got insurance company actuaries
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
that would be off step our Market
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
conduct uh the directors of our
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
divisions would be off step and so we
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
have a number of those positions that
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
are there it provides the insurance
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
commissioner as they change some ability
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
to to build his own team around him uh
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
and also to be dynamic as things change
 
01:05:43.329 --> 01:05:43.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
are you having any trouble with
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
retention like we're hearing from other
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
departments absolutely the reason I'm
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
the reason I I'm kind of being
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
foreshadowing a loss of talent is
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
because that's exactly what's happening
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
and we knew it you know five years ago I
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
was not commissioner but I was in the
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
industry and I listened to Roger say to
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
you all I'm worried about the grand of
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
the department uh
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
four years ago Roger said that I'm sorry
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh John Elias said that I've lived it
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm losing I lost my entire tax team
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
in the last 18 months I was two people
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
and they were amazing the best that we
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
could have ever had some of the most
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
complicated work that's done here in the
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
insurance department and so we are and
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
retaining them we're not losing them to
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
other departments in large part we're
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
losing them to retirement I'll return
 
01:06:31.859 --> 01:06:34.010 align:start position:0%
losing them to retirement I'll return
okay

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
all right see no further questions it
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
looks like you may not have to come back
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
but thank you so much okay thanks oh I
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
I didn't I just have some notes I do
 
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the presentation we gave
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
to ways I mean just has all the
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
background what the department does I'm
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
happy to leave that that'd be great
 
01:06:54.539 --> 01:06:55.910 align:start position:0%
happy to leave that that'd be great
yeah okay

01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
I wonder if if we have
 
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
more self-funded agencies than a lot of
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
years ago we had labor was kind of
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
self-funded and people complained that
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
there wasn't enough control so we we
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
took the monies they were making and
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
bringing in and made them into going to
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
the general fund and we funded them out
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
of the general fund it was kind of a
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
wash but
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
some people think we have more control
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
you remember savini who was an insurance
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
he didn't have a lot of people but he
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
contracted everything so
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
I guess is good and bad about both
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know and there's nothing we can do
 
01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
about it because there's no General
 
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.370 align:start position:0%

01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we have that document
 
01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:15.860 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to Mr Hoffman
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%

498-a and all matters relating to the
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
need for reassessments by municipalities
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
the board's budget as you can see is a
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
although the economy has resulted in
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
higher expenses in some classes we were
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
still able to meet the governor's
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
targeted numbers and the governor has
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
approved the prioritized needs which are
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
the doit and rent for the building that
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
we reside in which is Johnson Hall in
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
the gallon Office Park
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
and based on that the board respectfully
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
requests you approve the budget and we
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
that you may have and we thank you for
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
your time
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
well you've both been around a long time
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
good to see familiar faces don't retire
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
no no every time yet good other
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative Sweeney thank
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you both for being
 
01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
here today uh really a quick question uh
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
10 and 11 the
 
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
pretty balanced between classified and
 
01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
unclassified employees I don't know if
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
you can provide more insight as to
 
01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:05.540 align:start position:0%
why that there's a balance there or
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
would you like to answer that I sure
 
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.709 align:start position:0%
would you like to answer that I sure
would

01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
so class 10 is comprised of we have
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
myself two other full-time staff
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
currently a vacant review appraiser so
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
that gets us to for full-time and a
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
part-time which is embedded in class 50.
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
so we're very small office there's seven
 
01:12:27.729 --> 01:12:27.739 align:start position:0%
um three
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
unclassified to which Michelle is one of
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
the three and we're all permanent
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and the reason it's
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
balanced is because I have 22 years you
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to ask her how many years but
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
we're all maxed out we've been around a
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
long time so the longevity we don't have
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
a high turnover rate the challenge with
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
the review appraiser is just because
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
um we're competing
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
where we can't compete with the private
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
sector for that position because of its
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
technical expertise so we're going to
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
try what we're hoping for the raise and
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
if if that might help us fill that that
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
might make it more competitive if if
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
that passes so um but yeah we're a very
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
small office and we've all just been
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
there probably way too long if that
 
01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:16.010 align:start position:0%
there probably way too long if that
helps

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
represent Weiler
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so are your board
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
members not listed as employees we at
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
class 11 with the unclassified
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
and we are listed as as employees
 
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.950 align:start position:0%
and we are listed as as employees
and

01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.910 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
the other question that
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
I was thinking of was um
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
the fees that you collect the filing
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
fees they're not shown here what what
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
portion of of your expenses do they
 
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
amount to do you think
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
we charge most of our filing fees we
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
have over 70 statutes that are
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
appealable and those are all 65 dollars
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
per appeal so we average about 400
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
appeals a year
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
we're not generating a lot of Revenue
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 55 000 and 60 000 a
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
year the eminent domains kick up to a
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars the state DOT usually
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
files maybe 10 to 15 takings a year
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
so we're not
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
I couldn't even do that math it's going
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
to be probably one percent or less of
 
01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.050 align:start position:0%
to be probably one percent or less of
what

01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
work and all that money does go back to
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I thought maybe it should be shown
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you what is the transfer from the
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
um that is the tent represents the 10 of
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
the budget where we're basically using
 
01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
do we are DOT transfers
 
01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:06.530 align:start position:0%
do we are DOT transfers
um

01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
that portion of our budget to compensate
 
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
for the eminent domain work that we do
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
because a lot of their stuff is federal
 
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's not really Highway fund they call
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
it other and it's fuel inventory
 
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
maintenance 22 years I don't really know
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
what that means but it's somewhere
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
embedded it's not strictly a highway
 
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
fund but it's they call it something
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
related to highway so it's 10 we do it's
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
been stagnant at 10 because that 10
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
percent represents of our total caseload
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
approximately how much of that is
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
focused on them in a domain and the time
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
spent on those files so that's the
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
taxation portion consumes the 90 if you
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
will so it's we build I build dot
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
quarterly for that those expenses
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
related to that 10 and they transfer and
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
they we don't only receive takings from
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
the state we also receive them from
 
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.209 align:start position:0%
the state we also receive them from
municipalities

01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
um school districts and various other
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
public and cities
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm not familiar with the
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
board at all
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
are you the people making the decisions
 
01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.709 align:start position:0%
are you the people making the decisions
about

01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
who who's right who's wrong or or are
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
you more like staff of the end of the
 
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
appointed and it's the cleric of the
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
board which is very similar to a clerk
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
of court she manages the docket and the
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
staff and
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
does all the other work involved with
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
running the office as a chair I
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
typically run the hearings and we need a
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
quorum of two we have three members we
 
01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:45.380 align:start position:0%
need a quorum of two to sit
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
our hearings are very much like hearing
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
center Court
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
but they're much less stringent where
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
where especially if we receive Pros as
 
01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
coming in to testify we allow them a lot
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
of Liberty to present their case but
 
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
once we receive the evidence from both
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer and then the municipality
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
then we
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
deliberate and and write a decision our
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
decision is appealable to the New
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court so we have to
 
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
make findings in fact and rulings of law
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
what fraction of your decisions are
 
01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.830 align:start position:0%
what fraction of your decisions are
appealed

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.450 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
currently we have two
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
um it's usually under two about two or
 
01:17:42.169 --> 01:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
three a year not many out of considering
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
the volume no it's it's low very low
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
under one percent for sure what's the
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
overall volume
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
on a rolling basis so you get your tax
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill usually late fall okay so what
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
happens is you have until that that
 
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
March is the abatement deadline and then
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
that following September so almost you
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
know nine months after your bill is the
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
appeal for that tax here so we're it
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
looks like we're always behind but we
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
will end up every September with about
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
400 appeals we always at that time in
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
the year still have
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
a couple 300 to 300 open so we're
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
chronically have like this rolling seven
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
750 it just they go out but they come
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
back it's like a wave right I equate it
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
to the ocean as much as leaves comes
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
right back in so yeah we're running
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
about a seven seven to eight hundred
 
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
depends on the year it also depends on
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
reval Cycles when Manchester does a
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
reval I know it's going to be a good
 
01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
year as far as business
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
um it's job security but then you know
 
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
when the rebels if they're not getting
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
done the larger cities if they do them
 
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
every five years which most don't but
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
most of them do them more frequently so
 
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
we get that influx
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
um but typically what the court sees are
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
usually issues of law issues of first
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
precedence their job is to determine
 
01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.229 align:start position:0%
precedence their job is to determine
valuation

01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
valuation
 
01:18:59.570 --> 01:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
um on all of whether it's a state tax
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
appeal whether it's it's property tax
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
it's uh exemptions it's it's all they're
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
all slightly different but the general
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
thread is valuation and the court will
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
take a few like I said usually they're
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
interesting cases that just are hinging
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
on a word in the statute that no one can
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
interpret or doesn't
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
it that's usually the linchpin is the
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
law and then three a year maybe on
 
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
average not a lot we we just received
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
um a copy of a decision I think a month
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
or two ago it was Rama which is a
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
Rochester Fair
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
it was an exemption appeal and the board
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
determined that it was a charitable
 
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
purpose therefore they were exempt from
 
01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
paying taxes and it went up to the
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme the Supreme Court and it took
 
01:19:49.810 --> 01:19:49.820 align:start position:0%
them almost a year to decide that one
 
01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:54.260 align:start position:0%
and they just did and issued an opinion
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
affirming the board's decision
 
01:19:59.330 --> 01:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
is there some particular I'm sorry is
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
there some particular
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
RSA or group of rsas that generate 50 of
 
01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
your case or something that are
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
especially problematic and if we did
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
something to clear them up it would
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
make half your cases go away or
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
something like that is there
 
01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:22.550 align:start position:0%
something like that is there
yes

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
well most of our decisions are our
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
appeals at property tax Appeals
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
um they are some are problematic some a
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
contamination appeals some are we've had
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington hotel a lot of
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
larger properties industrial commercial
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
properties are appealing now we've got
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
a case coming up on Tuesday that we
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
participate will last all day it's with
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
the attorneys and appraisers and it
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
I haven't even had a chance to look at
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
it yet I've never heard about it it's a
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
movie theater yes so it's really about
 
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
judgment what is something really worth
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
right is that it's it's not about law
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's about no but it's based on the
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
evidence and we and it and it is law
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
because we it has to be a legal opinion
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
if we air
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
on on a legal
 
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.890 align:start position:0%
on on a legal
case

01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
um then they have the right to take it
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
up to the Supreme Court
 
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
it's a fascinating board
 
01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to take your case to the
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
Superior Court you could do that or take
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
it to this board and these the board
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
members are appointed by the Supreme
 
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.770 align:start position:0%
members are appointed by the Supreme
Court

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
so they do have the Supreme Court
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
connection as they are appointed by the
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but but that's the only
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
connection we do have with them yeah
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
representative hatch followed by
 
01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
represent Senator Universe I'm amazed
 
01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:55.850 align:start position:0%
represent Senator Universe I'm amazed
that

01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
um you're able to adjudicate all that
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
you do with the resources you have to do
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
so so I mean what outside resources do
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
you do you have to hire
 
01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:08.300 align:start position:0%
um other entities or
 
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
individuals or you just do all this
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
within the house we do it in-house
 
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.750 align:start position:0%
within the house we do it in-house
um

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
we tried this past year to have we went
 
01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and the governor
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
and Council to have the funds for the
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
review appraisal position transferred
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
into a class 102 contract
 
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.450 align:start position:0%
into a class 102 contract
um

01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:36.169 --> 01:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
and we haven't been able to work that
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
out where we can get someone who isn't
 
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
maybe biased
 
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
um to do that would be working on
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
revaluations and that's pretty intense
 
01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
and so we're back to trying to get the
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
review appraisal position filled but we
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
also are very short on staff
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
um and our staff is not knowledgeable in
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
the work that Anne does and she's one of
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
those people if she leaves it's going to
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
be a position that's going to be very
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
hard to fill
 
01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.189 align:start position:0%
hard to fill
um

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
and we do we do have would like and and
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
we were talking we've already been
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the next biennium
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
um requesting another employee that
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be more of a manager type that
 
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.550 align:start position:0%
would be more of a manager type that
could

01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
do a lot of the duties that she does now
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
that she just
 
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
she quite frankly she does the job of
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
two to three people I you know
 
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
so you don't have a very deep bench
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's where I mean that's a concern in
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
other words if either of you are not
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:54.020 align:start position:0%
seriously I mean
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
it's a problem yes if if one of the
 
01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
other of us retired or went to another
 
01:24:01.739 --> 01:24:03.050 align:start position:0%
other of us retired or went to another
job

01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of Anne's job because I
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
work very closely with her as a chair
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
and my former job was as the clerk but
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
that position has evolved so much over
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
the years that it would be difficult for
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
me to carry on my own duties and try and
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
train somebody and do her duties in the
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
interim so are you budgeting to take
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
care of that Gap that we have it to me
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
this this seems like a pretty critical
 
01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be addressed
 
01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.570 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be addressed
post-hason

01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
post-hason
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
since 2008 when our budget and cutbacks
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
had been made and it was just a steady
 
01:24:49.729 --> 01:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
chop chop chop chop and eventually you
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
know we're at the point yeah if you take
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
one more away God the wheels are going
 
01:24:53.159 --> 01:24:54.410 align:start position:0%
one more away God the wheels are going
off

01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:55.370 align:start position:0%
off
um

01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
but I I credit
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
and and I appreciate everything chair
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
LeBron is saying um and I appreciate the
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
the feedback but I credit we do what we
 
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
do and I believe in the efficiencies and
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
I am probably that was one of my strong
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
suits is efficiency and I desperately
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
need the oit budget to pass because I
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
cannot do what I do without the software
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
to do it the software that we have
 
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
invested in is one reason I can do what
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
I do with three people but if one of us
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
is out you know right now yeah there's
 
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
one person in our office along with one
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
board member and and it's okay I we
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
we've been able to adapt be efficient
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I can't run it any more smoother
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
than it is but I said as we you know I'm
 
01:25:46.689 --> 01:25:46.699 align:start position:0%
going to be approaching you know
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
retirement at some point and I said yeah
 
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
we we need to get another full-time body
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
but you know how difficult that is to to
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
get sometimes we've asked multiple times
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
for another body and they say no so you
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
have to do what you have to do and you
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
have to adapt so that's what we've been
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
able to do but the software is critical
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
to me because I can't do push as much
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
paper as I do without that software and
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
if that thing breaks it really
 
01:26:11.689 --> 01:26:11.699 align:start position:0%
it would not be pretty but um body wise
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
we we limp along and Band-Aid it as we
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
have to do and that's just the reality
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
of a small agency I I don't have you
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
know we used to when I first started in
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
2002 we had a staff we were an agency of
 
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.950 align:start position:0%
2002 we had a staff we were an agency of
12.

01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
and there were set you know it was a
 
01:26:30.129 --> 01:26:30.139 align:start position:0%
four-person board the rest were staff
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I managed and over the years it's
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
just pick them off one by one and here
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
we are so yeah our intent is we're going
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
to put a 7D in as we've done before and
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
next budget try it again
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's all we can do that's further
 
01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.450 align:start position:0%
that's all we can do that's further
question

01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:50.270 align:start position:0%
question
representing

01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks definitely for
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
everything you're doing I was um
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
I was curious to the vast majority of
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
people appealing abatement decisions Etc
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
come from your board as opposed to going
 
01:27:06.169 --> 01:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
straight to the Superior Court
 
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
I think the vast majority does we've
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
we've tried to investigate that in the
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
past and there are a lot that go to the
 
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
superior court but the ones that do are
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
like the public service companies
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
because they've come to us before and
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
they don't like our decisions and they
 
01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:27.620 align:start position:0%
they're looking for more more cash back
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
so they think going to the court where
 
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
they only have one judge sitting at they
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
may have a better chance at winning the
 
01:27:35.639 --> 01:27:36.610 align:start position:0%
may have a better chance at winning the
case

01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:36.620 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
there are several people that do that on
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
a regular basis but I think the vast
 
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
majority come to the board it's also a
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
250 dollar filing fee with the court and
 
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
a 65 filing fee with the board and we've
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
heard from so many people after a
 
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
hearing that they appreciate the
 
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
attention they get that we listen we ask
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
questions and
 
01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
we're aware of the law and they
 
01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
so do you have a sense of how many
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
appeals are actually granted I mean it
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
gives you a sense of how good the
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
assessors are doing I guess that's my
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
math we we don't keep track of that it'd
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
be very difficult to do that because
 
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
it's based on the property that's being
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
appealed and it's also based on the
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
evidence that comes in
 
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
there are cases that that get granted
 
01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.070 align:start position:0%
there are cases that that get granted
that

01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.169 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:28:41.169 --> 01:28:41.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people will come in
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
with appraisers and good appraisers see
 
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
the commercial industrial properties
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
they'll have appraisals testify and do
 
01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.870 align:start position:0%
they'll have appraisals testify and do
reports

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we find that the
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities are not doing as much as
 
01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:00.020 align:start position:0%
they could be doing
 
01:29:03.649 --> 01:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
we have everyone go through a mediation
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
cycle before we schedule hearings and we
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
find when
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
the hearing is held that the taxpayer
 
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
will say well they didn't really tell us
 
01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
that they didn't make an offer to us
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
when we were in mediation now we walk in
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
the door and now they're offering us
 
01:29:21.719 --> 01:29:22.850 align:start position:0%
the door and now they're offering us
something

01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:24.169 align:start position:0%
something
so

01:29:24.169 --> 01:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
I think the the assessors could be doing
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
a better job
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
and I hope there aren't any in here
 
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.950 align:start position:0%
and I hope there aren't any in here
listening

01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.410 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
helpless

01:29:38.410 --> 01:29:38.420 align:start position:0%
helpless
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt I you have
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh you thought that the
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
transfers to oit were very very very
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
important uh looking at the numbers that
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
comes the numbers here on the page
 
01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
approach insignificance basically based
 
01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
on the grand total of what we're going
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
to spend what is the why why is the
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
transfer to oit and very important my
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
software license is is uh
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
if if I don't maintain the database and
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
maintain the software and if it breaks
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
we have a technical issue a glitch
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it they're my
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
lifeline so if it if it goes down and I
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
know that is a small number probably
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
compared to what other people spend on
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
software but it's our our bread and
 
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
butter that's our lifeline and I don't
 
01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.649 align:start position:0%
butter that's our lifeline and I don't
wanna

01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
wanna
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's important to me because even though
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's a small it and it's actually it's
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
under 10 000 for the license
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
um and the rest of it is licenses for
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
Microsoft and all the other products
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
this product is is wonderful because it
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
integrates with Microsoft very nicely
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
and we've had it since
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
2007 when we went from dos so we've come
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.729 --> 01:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
hello there we go uh part of our job is
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
to find out the things that that are
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
important and sometimes something like
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
that can be overlooked because as I say
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's not a heck of a lot of money uh
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
but it it a little bit of money can
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh the takings of the dot
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
comes in with how long does that
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
generally take to move through the
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
process a file and you render a decision
 
01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.350 align:start position:0%
process a file and you render a decision
and

01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
do you want to answer that I sure can
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
um typically
 
01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:29.689 align:start position:0%
um typically
um

01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
the dot by the time it's come to the
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
board they've already tried and
 
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
attempted to negotiate with the
 
01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
landowner the landowner has refused the
 
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
offer of just compensation so when it
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
gets to the board it effectually
 
01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
transfers the title from that landowner
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
once they file that taking now dot has
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
possession of that land so now the issue
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
before the board comes just compensation
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
the landowner has a right after it's
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
filed within 30 days of the taking they
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
have a right to go to Superior Court
 
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
will they first come to the board and
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
ask but they may want to fight the
 
01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
taking and the necessity of the taking
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
is the taking truly necessary does the
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
state or the town really have to put the
 
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:13.580 align:start position:0%
road there
 
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
so that process could go to the Superior
 
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
Court we would I have to transfer those
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
if it's a taking that they're
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
questioning that necessity the whole God
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
that could take the court a year we had
 
01:32:27.169 --> 01:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
one in Portsmouth of the one I've I've
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
only seen it happen this one time the
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
case was open with us for 10 years it
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
got so tied up in the court system so
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
here one from us to Superior Court up to
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court back down up and down
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
over it's like chess
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
and the court ultimately decided there
 
01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
was no need for Portsmouth to do what
 
01:32:47.570 --> 01:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
they did and take the land
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
so then what had happened in that case
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
is it comes back again this is now we're
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
on year nine of just the legal finagling
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
and then they had to decide
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't the the just compensation for the
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
part taken it was the just compensation
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
for what was temporarily taken while it
 
01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't a taking so it becomes a
 
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
different valuation issue and of course
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
now it's back in court so I figure 20
 
01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
years from now we'll that'll get
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
resolved but it was that was the only
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
one I've ever seen mostly it takes a
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
year not to be long-winded it's it's
 
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
probably a good year because they have
 
01:33:20.810 --> 01:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
that right if they don't go to the court
 
01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
that right if they don't go to the court
then

01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
um they're going to want to get those
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
appraisals it's embedded in law that the
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
the dot must pay up to a thousand
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
dollars for those folks to to get an
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
appraisal they help pay for that because
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
this is a process nobody wants to go
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
through like I wouldn't wish this on
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
anybody you're losing either all or part
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
of your land sometimes permanent most of
 
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
the time permanent sometimes temporary
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
could be just drainage
 
01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
they're paying for or a temporary
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
easement but most of the time it's
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
permanent loss so they get that option
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
so they have to get an appraiser that
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
takes time we try I try to schedule them
 
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
obviously we have they have to go view
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I I don't typically make them go
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
snowshoeing I wait until good weather so
 
01:34:03.649 --> 01:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
that it's dry they can see the land they
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
can see what was what exactly the
 
01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
project that whoever was doing what that
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
looks like so yeah within a year they're
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
typically in and out we make those more
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
of a priority but it does depend on the
 
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
season too so okay thanks that was
 
01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:19.070 align:start position:0%
season too so okay thanks that was
helpful

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none you may be off the hook
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
although uh Mr Hoffman has something to
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
hand out her I'm sorry I just wanted to
 
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
clarify because the documents that you
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
have looked a little bit different and
 
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
this is relatively fresh it's the
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
governor's budget just two days ago and
 
01:34:43.209 --> 01:34:43.219 align:start position:0%
I wanted you to have a peek at that
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
poit line to make sure that we're
 
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
and we're lucky to have Mr Hoffman he
 
01:34:58.129 --> 01:34:58.139 align:start position:0%
double checks and triple checks our work
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
I think I gave him my entire initial
 
01:35:01.739 --> 01:35:02.689 align:start position:0%
I think I gave him my entire initial
budget

01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
for him to make copies of our
 
01:35:08.450 --> 01:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
appeals that I mentioned on pages 11 and
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
12. so I think you may have looked at
 
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
what what was originally asked for and
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
they would there were changes made
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that and we do have the
 
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
all right we'll keep up the good work
 
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we'll need to see you
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
again unless someone differs with that
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
they were all so easy and I
 
01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
so my colleague representative McGuire
 
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
said if you raised your fee would you be
 
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
able to afford if you will another
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
employee which you obviously 800 cases
 
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
extra hundred dollars eighty thousand
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:50.149 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
oh Beauty has played it but I'm not sure
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
what the year but we have asked multiple
 
01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
times to have that being reached to our
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
dollars because
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know 65 when you've got a commercial
 
01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:06.470 align:start position:0%
you know 65 when you've got a commercial
emergency

01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
right so have you thought about as a
 
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:10.860 align:start position:0%
percentage of the amount of dispute
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
number one we don't even know what the
 
01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:22.870 align:start position:0%
number one we don't even know what the
amount

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
represents Sweeney has a question now
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so it's 250 dollars to
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
take the same case to the superior court
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
or they could pay 65 and talk to you
 
01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.590 align:start position:0%
or they could pay 65 and talk to you
yeah

01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
I mean I think we would just see less
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
caselope I think the caselo would shift
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and then the new so
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
but I'll bet there are 800 cases is much
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
higher than the new judge we just added
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
to this area is going to handle right I
 
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
mean he's going to do what is he going
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's mainly Zoning for I
 
01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
think that it's a zoning issue yeah
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
first is an appraisal you want to take
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
1977. okay do you know when you tried to
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
raise the fee before
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
I was not the last biennium I think it
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
was a prior one
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah I don't think so I've talked to
 
01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
the governor's office about it before
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking to the legislature and
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
nothing has happened so if I mean did
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
you have a bill put in I'm sorry if I
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
may did you have a bill put into Ways
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
and Means to adjust the fee or how did
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
you go about that
 
01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
how would you go about it how did you
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
get it how did you oh how I think
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
through testimony and discussions with
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget director
 
01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
um and they based on the the economy
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to add anything to
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers appealing to us so
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very well thank you we'll
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
all right next we have the executive
 
01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.850 align:start position:0%
all right next we have the executive
Council

01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
all right state your name or the record
 
01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:27.179 align:start position:0%
please good morning still my name is
 
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
Megan Rose and I am the executive
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
assistant for the office of the
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I have a handout that I prepared for
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
you today which is kind of just a
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what our office is
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
as small as it is and the amount of
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
space we take up or are responsible for
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
across the state the entire State and
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
how that's broken up for the executive
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
counselors it touches on our prioritized
 
01:40:59.810 --> 01:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
needs and just a little bit of a recap
 
01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.070 align:start position:0%
needs and just a little bit of a recap
of

01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
a very small recap of
 
01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
or overview of our calendar year 2022
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
and some of the things that we did in
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
our office
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
so we are a very small office it's the
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
five executive counselors who are all
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
elected officials the office staff is
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
myself and then we have in our budget a
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
part-time office assistant which is
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
actually in one of our our prioritized
 
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.610 align:start position:0%
actually in one of our our prioritized
needs

01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
um are it's important that you know we
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
are ensuring public access to the
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire that they can
 
01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
reach the counselors through their
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
office in Concord
 
01:41:40.729 --> 01:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
um as well as on their cell phones and
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
at their home offices and on the road
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
which they often do
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and that we me and the part-time
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
person support them administratively one
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
by being here today and two with the
 
01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
various things that they ask of us or
 
01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:57.659 align:start position:0%
need for us for Council meetings for
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
public hearings information sessions
 
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
should we need them and there are other
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite slides I think that I
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
put together
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
um is just the district map of the
 
01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
council so
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
um a little bit about me I will insert
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
in here is simply that I've been a state
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
employee for the better part of 20 years
 
01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
I have had the privilege of working for
 
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
other small agencies started with the
 
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
Labor Relations Board years ago worked
 
01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:31.669 align:start position:0%
Labor Relations Board years ago worked
for

01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office the
 
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:35.219 align:start position:0%
executive Council as the part-time
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
assistant years ago I've worked for the
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
judicial branch briefly and then also
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the governor's office and found my
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
way back to the council because
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
apparently that is where I belong that
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
is where I enjoy helping the public and
 
01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
I enjoy working for the counselors but
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
if you look so when I first joined the
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
council we were back with Governor Lynch
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
and this was not
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
the map
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
it was two maps ago uh and then we
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
switched back in 2010 from the 2010
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
census and learning those new districts
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
was quite a challenge and so I put this
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
in here for you all because it helps me
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
to get used to the new the lines
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
um it kind of breaks down the square
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
miles that each of the counselors is
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
responsible for covering and how many
 
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:22.580 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are in their District
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's separated equal by
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
population which I'm sure all of you
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
know and I'm sure you're all getting
 
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
used to your new districts as well
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
so the core function of the executive
 
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
council is to authorize expenditures of
 
01:43:38.890 --> 01:43:38.900 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
 
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
authorizing justice of the peace and
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
notary applications they confirm
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
appointments to the over 300 estate
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions through that are
 
01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
mostly volunteer throughout the state of
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well as agency heads
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
and then by Statute judicial nominees
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
and Public Utility Commission nominees
 
01:43:59.209 --> 01:43:59.219 align:start position:0%
they hold public hearings on both of
 
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
those nominees and state agency heads at
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
their discretion
 
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
um the judicial and public utility
 
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
nominees are required by law for them to
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
hold public hearings
 
01:44:13.609 --> 01:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
and they also participate in the 10-year
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
Highway plan as members of gasset the
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
governor's advisory Commission on
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
Intermodal Transportation where they
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
hold meetings throughout their districts
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
and take input from the towns and cities
 
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
on priorities that they want addressed
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
as they redraft and move forward
 
01:44:30.719 --> 01:44:31.729 align:start position:0%
as they redraft and move forward
um

01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
on the 10-year Highway plan
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
so as you'll have seen in our budget
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
documents the prioritized needs we are
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
asking for includes a request to
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
increase funding for the executive
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
Council stipends the executive council
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
do receive a stipend each which is paid
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
out to them monthly and that covers the
 
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
cost of their travel it covers the costs
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to cover like travel costs
 
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
and the costs they incur from like
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
working throughout the district and
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
working oftentimes away from the the
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
council office and in their District
 
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
they're traveling in hundreds of miles
 
01:45:14.689 --> 01:45:14.699 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure we can all appreciate and
 
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
relate to but they're using their
 
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
personal phones they're using their home
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
offices as well
 
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
um back in the day they were apparently
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
assigned way before my time they were
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
assigned State phones at one point in
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
time but that went by the wayside years
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
ago and they figured with the amount of
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
travel that the counselors were doing
 
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
this was the best way to encapsulate a
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
the last time that that was increased at
 
01:45:44.209 --> 01:45:44.219 align:start position:0%
all was back in fiscal year 2010 again
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
before my time serving with the council
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
and in all the years it has not been
 
01:45:52.850 --> 01:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
increased I am aware that I don't want
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
to say approximately six or so seven
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
maybe years ago there was talk about
 
01:46:00.169 --> 01:46:00.179 align:start position:0%
them asking for an increase but then the
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
election was held the counselors changed
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
and thus everything the direction that
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
things were going also changed
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
so so just a quick follow-up to what you
 
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
just told us sure what's the stipend now
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
the stipend now is district one gets
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
seven 750 a month and the other
 
01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
well we have a little break in the
 
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
action any questions uh before that's a
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
lot of Representative McGuire in here
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
what's this under organization notes
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
those are twelve thousand dollars is
 
01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:40.970 align:start position:0%
those are twelve thousand dollars is
this

01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's not what you're calling the
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
stipend I guess
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
I would have let me just get to one
 
01:46:59.209 --> 01:46:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
so that is not for that's obviously not
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
monthly that's that's kind of ballooned
 
01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
monthly that's that's kind of ballooned
out

01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay so this is more like a thousand a
 
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
month eleven thousand
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
nine hundred seventy and you said 750
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's what they currently get oh I see
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
so this budget is requesting that they
 
01:47:25.729 --> 01:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
that they get an increase gotcha okay
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just a question uh
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
in regard to the number of positions
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
sure on the budget here it says six but
 
01:47:41.689 --> 01:47:41.699 align:start position:0%
in your uh your presentation it seems
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
like there's only three people or or
 
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
less uh note there is there are six
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
official positions five of which is the
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
council members so there's officially
 
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
the five executive counselors and then
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
there's myself
 
01:47:57.050 --> 01:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
and then the part-time person
 
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:57.830 align:start position:0%
and then the part-time person
um

01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
is it's not an official part-time
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
position like because there's no uh
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
benefits associated with it thank you
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't have evil thanks so just to
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
clarify again on the stipend that covers
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
mileage and everything they don't get
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
anything additional this is like total
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
or correct they they do they do get a
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
wage but that is this is for to cover
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
any expenses as far as travel any
 
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
mailings that they do
 
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
remind me what the wages
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's just over 17
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
000. it's per it's in
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
I could look up the RSA and tell you
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up I'm looking at your
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
prioritized need and it says executive
 
01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
Council stipend increase just for
 
01:48:58.609 --> 01:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
district one but this is all inclusive
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative yes thanks thanks
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
um the stipend is that an automatic
 
01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
thing or do they have to show receipts
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
of any kind it is an automatic thing
 
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
um again because in the past it was a
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
receipt based and there was so many
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
travel receipts being put forward it
 
01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
became so cumbersome and so
 
01:49:25.139 --> 01:49:32.090 align:start position:0%
became so cumbersome and so
foreign

01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
yes you can continue sorry for the
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
interruption nope quite all right so
 
01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.810 align:start position:0%
interruption nope quite all right so
um

01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:41.410 --> 01:49:41.420 align:start position:0%
the other one of the other
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that we are asking for
 
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
is a request to increase the funding for
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
our part-time office assistant which is
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
the person that serves with me for the
 
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
council right now we have been very
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
blessed to have with us Joanne rule who
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
was the executive assistant before me
 
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
and also was my boss when I was the
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
part-time assistant so it's interesting
 
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:10.340 align:start position:0%
that we have traded roles
 
01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
her institutional knowledge and her
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
demeanor has been greatly appreciated
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
but she would like to officially retire
 
01:50:19.739 --> 01:50:21.550 align:start position:0%
but she would like to officially retire
sadly

01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
sadly
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
and work and we've been working with her
 
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
to you know pair back the time that
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
she's here
 
01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
um but as as I'm sure you know from many
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
of your other hearings that you've done
 
01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:37.139 align:start position:0%
and maybe even in your personal lives
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're in a very interesting and
 
01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
challenging hiring climate right now and
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
it is a part-time position that does not
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
offer any benefits and so I'm trying to
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that I can be a little bit
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
competitive in an hourly rate that I can
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
offer someone the importance being that
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
we have office coverage for example this
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
morning as I was pan in a perfectly
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
great mood coming here uh I got a phone
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
call at the office from a constituent
 
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
who needed
 
01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:10.790 align:start position:0%
who needed
um

01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
some assistance and and an ear and I was
 
01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
like oh Lord I do not have a lot of time
 
01:51:20.450 --> 01:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
and so I I was thinking man if I had
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
somebody else here today that would be
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
fantastic but um having that office
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
coverage is important having someone to
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
be there if I'm out ill having someone
 
01:51:31.570 --> 01:51:31.580 align:start position:0%
that actually can learn the office
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
state government is nuanced and
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
especially when you're working for an
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
office where people are elected
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
officials because it changes I think the
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
needs of the counselors change as the
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
council itself changes
 
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
and having someone that can come in and
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
learn those ropes and assist will allow
 
01:51:52.129 --> 01:51:52.139 align:start position:0%
us to make sure that we are serving the
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
state properly and serving the
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.450 --> 01:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
um the last is
 
01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
the increases for doit
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
um and I know I mean I just heard the
 
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
testimony of the board before me and I
 
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:09.260 align:start position:0%
know that these numbers aren't
 
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
necessarily large when we're talking
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
overall but they're very important to us
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have a ton of overhead but what
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
we do have it's important for us to be
 
01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:19.820 align:start position:0%
able to maintain
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
and and keep up with so we have systems
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
that are working incompatible with other
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
agencies and other offices
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
so being able to
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
have their support doit support and have
 
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
them come and work with us on upgrading
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
our computers when needed or the tablets
 
01:52:37.629 --> 01:52:37.639 align:start position:0%
for the counselors
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
as those have to be done I think we try
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
to do that every other year some like
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
there's either a new uh printer or a new
 
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
copier or a new tablet like a group of
 
01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
tablets for the counselors so that's
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's basically where that comes from
 
01:52:55.609 --> 01:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
their Rising costs that they've that
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
they they have to pass on and then the
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
needs that we have to
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
so what our our calendar year recap I
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
think is just kind of a
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
an interesting blip of what we're
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
talking about the the governor in and
 
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.609 --> 01:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
a significant portion of approximately
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
six the approximate 6.5 billion dollars
 
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is appropriated annually by the
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislature the amount of money that
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
passes through the council to review and
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
then either is approved or not
 
01:53:36.169 --> 01:53:36.179 align:start position:0%
um is quite remarkable and very and
 
01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
unique to the state of New Hampshire
 
01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:40.070 align:start position:0%
unique to the state of New Hampshire
solely

01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
solely
 
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
um there were 322 confirmations for
 
01:53:45.970 --> 01:53:45.980 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions approved
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
including Circuit Court judges a
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
superior court judge and commissioners
 
01:53:51.970 --> 01:53:51.980 align:start position:0%
of this for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
of which 10 public hearings were held
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
and they're typically held right at the
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
State House at the executive council
 
01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:00.830 align:start position:0%
State House at the executive council
chambers

01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
chambers
 
01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:03.179 align:start position:0%
um obviously we did what everybody else
 
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
did for covid and we we held them where
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
we could in venues that fit
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
um but it's nice to be back at the State
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
House doing that again
 
01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:14.699 align:start position:0%
um and then the gas at work that they do
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
was approved by the legislature and
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
Governor this past calendar year and
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
I would have loved to have been able to
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
provide like one round number for you
 
01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
but there's so much money that flows
 
01:54:27.659 --> 01:54:28.729 align:start position:0%
but there's so much money that flows
through

01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
um that that's sent to prioritized
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects especially one
 
01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:34.820 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that sticks out is like
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
242 million dollars went to Bridges just
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
Bridges across the state but there's
 
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
more details you can access that from
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
our website you can access it from Dot
 
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
and it's very interesting because they
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
go right out into the public into their
 
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
districts and they hold public hearings
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
and they take input from the towns and
 
01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
the town's people and then all of that
 
01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
comes together and they work very
 
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
diligently with DOT to put that together
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
that is pretty much the snapshot of our
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
office and I'm happy to answer any other
 
01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:11.470 align:start position:0%
office and I'm happy to answer any other
questions

01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
for Miss Rose yes representative Sweeney
 
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you so much for
 
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
being here certainly when the executive
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
Council goes on the road
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
who pays the venue fee I'm not seeing a
 
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
line in the budget for that how does
 
01:55:28.129 --> 01:55:28.139 align:start position:0%
that how does it dealt with if you're
 
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
renting an auditorium or so
 
01:55:34.129 --> 01:55:34.139 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council when we take
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
the show on the road
 
01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.410 align:start position:0%
the show on the road
um

01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's basically we are the host
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
the host allows us the privilege to come
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
and do the state's work wherever it is
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
that we're going
 
01:55:49.729 --> 01:55:49.739 align:start position:0%
um you'll see oftentimes we're at like
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
State Park venues
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
um or town venues and any costs
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
associated with that is basically it's
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
kind of like a donation type type thing
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
where people are just like here we will
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
allow you to utilize our space to
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
conduct your business
 
01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:08.219 align:start position:0%
so there is no line item for that thank
 
01:56:08.219 --> 01:56:11.930 align:start position:0%
so there is no line item for that thank
you

01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
for other questions I I'll go go ahead
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
the benefits line 60 is that strictly
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
for you or is that include some kind of
 
01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
benefits for the counselor
 
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
um I believe that's that covers me but
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
um I know that the council does have an
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
option and they work directly with
 
01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:34.070 align:start position:0%
option and they work directly with
um

01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
with the benefits team where they can
 
01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.870 align:start position:0%
with the benefits team where they can
um

01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
they can like Buy in or um it's health
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
insurance yes health insurance but we do
 
01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
right so we pay 100 and I assume yeah
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
they they do that it's a similar type
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:56.219 align:start position:0%
so I have a question to stipend there's
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
a differential between district one and
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
the others but looking at your map
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
District 2 now is almost identical to
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
District One
 
01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:08.699 align:start position:0%
square mileage Town wise so was there
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
any consideration of upping the district
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
too since as we used to refer to as a
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
ray Burton District which included like
 
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
half the state but now it has been
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
modified quite a bit yes so actually
 
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
that was modified so if in that line
 
01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
that page I think you said 186 that we
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
were looking at before so
 
01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:31.729 align:start position:0%
were looking at before so
um

01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:34.490 --> 01:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that there are two items
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
where they increase it says 11 970.
 
01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
that's district one 11970 district 2. oh
 
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
I didn't see that yep and then the other
 
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
three districts which and if you go to
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
the map in the in the booklet that I
 
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
just gave you like district one and
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
District Two now are like 10 Towns
 
01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
cities off from each other and they're
 
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:53.629 align:start position:0%
cities off from each other and they're
like

01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know a couple hundred square
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
miles off from each other so
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right thanks so I guess we have to
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
ask yourselves do they deserve a raise
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
or what do you think representative
 
01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.570 align:start position:0%
or what do you think representative
McGuire

01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.649 align:start position:0%
McGuire
yeah

01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
this is a category where there's no
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
right answer right I mean these are
 
01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:12.430 align:start position:0%
right answer right I mean these are
people

01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they're paid much less than any
 
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
other elected official of similar
 
01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
stature anywhere else in the country
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
just as we are right so there's no right
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
answer for for what they should be paid
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's just a
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
you know the only state that has
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
well there's three sure but I mean
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about somebody
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
who's elected to one-fifth of a state
 
01:58:38.770 --> 01:58:38.780 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:58:40.970 --> 01:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
you know what's such a person worth
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
there's no right answer to that right
 
01:58:45.169 --> 01:58:45.179 align:start position:0%
but but I think I understand it at least
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
so the 89 700 that's their salary so
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's roughly 17
 
01:58:56.209 --> 01:58:56.219 align:start position:0%
000 a piece right correct uh or eighteen
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
thousand a piece and then where you see
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
this line Tran in-state reimbursement
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
for transportation on the second page
 
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
line 70 that's this Transportation
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
stipend which districts one and two get
 
01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
a little bigger than districts three
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
four and five
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
so total they're getting roughly
 
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know call it ten thousand from that
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
line and and uh 16 or 17th whatever
 
01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
eighteen thousand from the other line so
 
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
their total compensation is roughly a
 
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
little under 30.
 
01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:34.490 align:start position:0%
little under 30.
um

01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
you know that doesn't seem unreasonable
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh any further
 
01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.870 align:start position:0%
uh any further
questions

01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:59:52.729 --> 01:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess you can report back
 
01:59:54.530 --> 01:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
to the counselors that they might get an
 
01:59:57.169 --> 01:59:57.179 align:start position:0%
increase Fair let's let's hope they're
 
01:59:57.179 --> 01:59:59.089 align:start position:0%
increase Fair let's let's hope they're
listening

01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
listening
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
so my guess is that we probably don't
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
need to see the executive Council unless
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
we find something
 
02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
where we get a call from one of the
 
02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659 align:start position:0%
councils asking for more money perhaps
 
02:00:15.649 --> 02:00:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
so good morning uh good afternoon rather
 
03:29:02.090 --> 03:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
it's a little slow here on the take-up
 
03:29:05.769 --> 03:29:05.779 align:start position:0%
uh liquor is next this is found on page
 
03:29:11.870 --> 03:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:14.090 --> 03:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
so it's all yours I know there are a few
 
03:29:16.429 --> 03:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
questions when you're done so thanks
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you Mr chairman
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee good afternoon
 
03:29:22.610 --> 03:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
I'm Joseph Malika I'm the chairman of
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%

2425 budget and Tina is the budget
 
03:29:39.410 --> 03:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
expert and the main Marquee of this so I
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
will let her take it away and we'll be
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions when you're
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
done thank you very much
 
03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:29:49.550 --> 03:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
so if you open your presentation on page
 
03:29:52.130 --> 03:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
two we've included the introduction it's
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
the same as we presented last week as a
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
reminder that the Liquor Commission is
 
03:29:59.030 --> 03:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
self-funded and our primary statutory
 
03:30:01.969 --> 03:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
Duties are to optimize profits and
 
03:30:03.889 --> 03:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
maintain controls through effective and
 
03:30:05.809 --> 03:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
efficient operations while providing
 
03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
service to customers all of which we
 
03:30:10.729 --> 03:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
take very seriously the budget we've
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
prepared and are presenting is the level
 
03:30:14.990 --> 03:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
of funding necessary to accomplish these
 
03:30:17.469 --> 03:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
legislative duties which are RSA
 
03:30:21.050 --> 03:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
176 3.
 
03:30:23.210 --> 03:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
are the sales and revenue projections
 
03:30:27.710 --> 03:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
that support the budget requesting since
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
we are self-funded this is similar to
 
03:30:32.330 --> 03:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
what we provided last week except for we
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
added the teal columns for the
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
Governor's recommended budget with FY 23
 
03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 liquor estimates at 135
 
03:30:47.210 --> 03:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
million in FY 24 and 25 the total
 
03:30:49.610 --> 03:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
expenses we included an estimate for the
 
03:30:52.250 --> 03:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
10 and the 2 percent raise to show the
 
03:30:56.530 --> 03:30:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:00.590 --> 03:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
so into the budget on page four is a
 
03:31:02.510 --> 03:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
listing of our major expense categories
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
that correspond to the table and the
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
line numbers that we've identified on
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
page five
 
03:31:09.469 --> 03:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
so I won't read through all the
 
03:31:11.450 --> 03:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
categories but there are a couple of um
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we think are important to highlight
 
03:31:16.010 --> 03:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
the first is number one salaries and
 
03:31:18.830 --> 03:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
benefits they're decreasing in FY 24
 
03:31:21.650 --> 03:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
even though with the requested 28 new
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
positions and this is because of a
 
03:31:25.550 --> 03:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
reduction in the overtime and part-time
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
budget requests and the changes in
 
03:31:31.030 --> 03:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
positions as a result of turnover
 
03:31:34.010 --> 03:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
fy25 increases are a result of salary
 
03:31:37.010 --> 03:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
steps and benefit increases
 
03:31:39.490 --> 03:31:39.500 align:start position:0%
the next one to highlight is number six
 
03:31:42.769 --> 03:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
technology it's increasing for our
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs request for
 
03:31:47.450 --> 03:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
subscriptions and existing support and
 
03:31:49.729 --> 03:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
maintenance contracts to support our
 
03:31:53.330 --> 03:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
next-gen d365 software platform and
 
03:31:55.010 --> 03:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
that's to replace our current point of
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
sale and back office Financial system
 
03:32:01.610 --> 03:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
number seven is our doit increase for
 
03:32:04.370 --> 03:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs it's also
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
to support the d365 software platform
 
03:32:11.210 --> 03:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget only included 500
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
000 each year of the million dollar
 
03:32:15.469 --> 03:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
request and this was for the Azure
 
03:32:18.290 --> 03:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
hosting services and liquor share of the
 
03:32:21.170 --> 03:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
increased shared services the unfunded
 
03:32:23.570 --> 03:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
doit requests are for two new positions
 
03:32:25.990 --> 03:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh handheld devices and cloud services
 
03:32:28.490 --> 03:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
all of which are important to support
 
03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
the new d365 software platform so we
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
feel these items could be added back to
 
03:32:35.870 --> 03:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
our budget without impacting the bottom
 
03:32:37.870 --> 03:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
line revenue
 
03:32:40.550 --> 03:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
the increases related to the new system
 
03:32:43.309 --> 03:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
are significant and that's because we've
 
03:32:45.410 --> 03:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
been running the same course system for
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
the last 40 years which has been
 
03:32:50.809 --> 03:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
supported primarily by in-house staff so
 
03:32:52.849 --> 03:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
moving to a current technology requires
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
a lot more licensing and cloud storage
 
03:32:58.490 --> 03:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
versus our current server and backup
 
03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.210 --> 03:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
so on
 
03:33:08.090 --> 03:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
oops and I just want to say yes you did
 
03:33:09.889 --> 03:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
hear Tina correctly The Liquor
 
03:33:11.929 --> 03:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
Commission is running on a 40 year old
 
03:33:11.939 --> 03:33:15.930 align:start position:0%
Commission is running on a 40 year old
platform

03:33:15.930 --> 03:33:15.940 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:15.940 --> 03:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:33:21.710 --> 03:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:25.130 --> 03:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh on page six is a listing of all of
 
03:33:27.229 --> 03:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
our additional prioritized needs that we
 
03:33:30.590 --> 03:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
had in our agency submitted budget the
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
items in green are the ones that are
 
03:33:37.250 --> 03:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:40.429 --> 03:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
on page seven and eight these show the
 
03:33:42.650 --> 03:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
annual breakdown by class and accounting
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
unit you'll see the breakdown is
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
consistent for both years for class and
 
03:33:50.090 --> 03:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
accounting unit the fy24 efficiency
 
03:33:53.269 --> 03:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
budget is 2.4 million or 2.9 percent
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
more than our FY 23 adjusted authorized
 
03:34:00.650 --> 03:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
budget plus a 3.3 million increase for
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
the additional prioritized needs for a
 
03:34:06.050 --> 03:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
total increase of 6.9 percent or 5.7
 
03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:07.550 align:start position:0%
total increase of 6.9 percent or 5.7
million

03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
salary benefits and traveler decreasing
 
03:34:12.110 --> 03:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
while the other categories are
 
03:34:13.849 --> 03:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
increasing due to the cost of inflation
 
03:34:16.190 --> 03:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
and projected needs such as utilities
 
03:34:19.870 --> 03:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
equipment Dent debt rent and contracts
 
03:34:24.290 --> 03:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
on page eight is the FY 25 total budget
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
which is increasing 3.1 million or 3.5
 
03:34:31.250 --> 03:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
percent over fy24 total budget and
 
03:34:32.929 --> 03:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
that's for again for salary step
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
increases and benefits and for the same
 
03:34:37.550 --> 03:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
cost of inflation and projected needs as
 
03:34:37.560 --> 03:34:40.969 align:start position:0%
cost of inflation and projected needs as
fy24

03:34:40.969 --> 03:34:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.979 --> 03:34:41.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:34:41.570 --> 03:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:44.090 --> 03:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
on page nine is our organizational
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
structure as we presented it last week
 
03:34:48.889 --> 03:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
I'll just point out the new positions
 
03:34:51.590 --> 03:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
requested in red we have two in audit
 
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
and inventory control section and that's
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
for an accountant and an additional
 
03:34:58.610 --> 03:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
internal auditor which is based on a
 
03:35:01.790 --> 03:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation from a prior audit report
 
03:35:03.889 --> 03:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
the other positions are under marketing
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
and Merchandising two are in marketing
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
for an additional beverage marketing
 
03:35:11.210 --> 03:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
specialist and a program specialist for
 
03:35:14.210 --> 03:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
data research and Analysis and then we
 
03:35:16.969 --> 03:35:16.979 align:start position:0%
have the 24 new store clerk positions
 
03:35:19.550 --> 03:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
for various retail outlets to meet the
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
needs of customers process transactions
 
03:35:25.190 --> 03:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
on page 10 we've provided so before we
 
03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
move too far away from the numbers okay
 
03:35:32.570 --> 03:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
I did have a couple of questions and
 
03:35:34.849 --> 03:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
anyone else that may have some questions
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the governor's
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
proposal that we received the other day
 
03:35:43.010 --> 03:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
for actual monies transferred to the
 
03:35:45.290 --> 03:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
general fund it was like 140 million
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
dollars according to his numbers
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
but I see under the Trends on page three
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
for actuals for
 
03:35:53.359 --> 03:35:55.010 align:start position:0%
for actuals for
2020

03:35:55.010 --> 03:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
2020
 
03:35:55.020 --> 03:35:56.929 align:start position:0%
2020
two

03:35:56.929 --> 03:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred and thirty three million
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
and you're a number so I just kind of
 
03:36:04.250 --> 03:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
curious about the discrepancy there
 
03:36:06.910 --> 03:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
because it shows actuals for 21
 
03:36:10.670 --> 03:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
transfer to General fundance of 148 and
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
133 and like I said the governor shows
 
03:36:14.530 --> 03:36:14.540 align:start position:0%
the actuals of
 
03:36:17.809 --> 03:36:17.819 align:start position:0%
140 million so I just wondering which
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry which page are you on I'm on
 
03:36:23.809 --> 03:36:23.819 align:start position:0%
page three no if the governor's uh page
 
03:36:23.819 --> 03:36:26.870 align:start position:0%
page three no if the governor's uh page
15.

03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
General funds education funds under
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
restricted Revenue transferred from The
 
03:36:33.769 --> 03:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission
 
03:36:37.610 --> 03:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
so page 15.
 
03:36:41.750 --> 03:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:50.809 --> 03:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:54.530 --> 03:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at FY 22 yeah and
 
03:36:57.650 --> 03:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
you're line 10 on page three
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's um if you look look at the
 
03:37:03.130 --> 03:37:03.140 align:start position:0%
revenue based on plan of the
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
141.8 including that's where the
 
03:37:09.469 --> 03:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
confusion lies with the transfer the
 
03:37:15.410 --> 03:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:15.420 --> 03:37:18.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:18.170 --> 03:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:20.809 --> 03:37:20.819 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite seeing it yet but I'm sure
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
I'll find it right line 12. I see that
 
03:37:23.279 --> 03:37:24.290 align:start position:0%
I'll find it right line 12. I see that
yeah

03:37:24.290 --> 03:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
but there's still the numbers the
 
03:37:29.330 --> 03:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.450 --> 03:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
anyway we can figure that so I can I can
 
03:37:34.729 --> 03:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
look back at that and get back to you on
 
03:37:40.429 --> 03:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah all right and as long as we're a
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
numbers the governor also said that he
 
03:37:47.269 --> 03:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
was looking to transfer about 14 million
 
03:37:50.210 --> 03:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
dollars out of the rainy day fund to a
 
03:37:51.710 --> 03:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
new liquor store
 
03:37:54.170 --> 03:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
for Hampton I'm just curious why we
 
03:37:57.050 --> 03:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take it out of the liquor line
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
versus taking it out of the rainy day
 
03:37:59.399 --> 03:38:00.650 align:start position:0%
versus taking it out of the rainy day
fund

03:38:00.650 --> 03:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
currently we have a capital
 
03:38:05.570 --> 03:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the Hampton projects
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
and we've put in a requests for
 
03:38:10.849 --> 03:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
additional funds for the increased costs
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that I can think of is
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
if we sold the property that would be
 
03:38:16.490 --> 03:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
paying off our debt but we didn't
 
03:38:19.370 --> 03:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
request additional rainy day funds for
 
03:38:21.290 --> 03:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
the Hampton properties we were funding
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:27.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:38:27.650 --> 03:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:38:29.690 --> 03:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
we'll look at that too because it looks
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
a little different I saw that too and I
 
03:38:35.450 --> 03:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and just one more question going on
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
to page five where the debt service is
 
03:38:44.269 --> 03:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
going to be increasing to about 15.4
 
03:38:46.729 --> 03:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
percent this is on
 
03:38:50.090 --> 03:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
other expenses down near the lower part
 
03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
of the middle of page five I just
 
03:38:55.729 --> 03:38:55.739 align:start position:0%
curious increasing it by 15.4 percent
 
03:38:58.849 --> 03:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
seems pretty substantial to me
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
and that's for the additional funds for
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
the Hampton property we put in 7 million
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
but it looks like the governor's Capital
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
put in 13 million so we have to clarify
 
03:39:11.690 --> 03:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
that one too because we were rolling
 
03:39:13.790 --> 03:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
forward the original appropriation for
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampton we brought that balance forward
 
03:39:17.690 --> 03:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
and then we were asking for additional
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
funds for the cost of construction
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
increases but when I looked at the
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
capital request it looks like we're
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
getting an additional 14 million so I
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
have to clarify that one too okay we
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
just haven't had a chance to reach out
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
yet all right I just you know as long as
 
03:39:34.250 --> 03:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
we were on the numbers you didn't want
 
03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
to go too far yes you have a tendency to
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:41.330 --> 03:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
um are there any other questions at
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
least on the numbers portion before we
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
move into the deeper part of the
 
03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:46.490 align:start position:0%
move into the deeper part of the
presentation

03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:39:49.570 --> 03:39:49.580 align:start position:0%
seeing none will move right along
 
03:39:52.370 --> 03:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:39:54.530 --> 03:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
um page 10 we provided this last week
 
03:39:57.290 --> 03:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
which was a history of positions except
 
03:40:01.250 --> 03:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
for this time we just added 24 and 25 to
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
show the additional positions which give
 
03:40:10.849 --> 03:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
on page 11 through 15 our summary by
 
03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
division as listed in the governor's
 
03:40:19.010 --> 03:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
budget book with page references the
 
03:40:20.750 --> 03:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
numbers we're presenting though are
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
based on our agency's submitted request
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
um there are party charts on each
 
03:40:28.010 --> 03:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
showing the breakdown by class category
 
03:40:31.250 --> 03:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
and an explanation uh for the changes
 
03:40:33.290 --> 03:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
first is the office of the Commissioners
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
overseeing all operations of the
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
commission with the primary goal to
 
03:40:38.690 --> 03:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
increase sales and maximize profits
 
03:40:40.910 --> 03:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
while operating in a cost-effective and
 
03:40:42.429 --> 03:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
efficient manner
 
03:40:45.290 --> 03:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
the one item to note is the increase in
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
FY 24 of 307
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
000 which is to add a consultant line to
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
support the doit with the next-gen
 
03:40:55.550 --> 03:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
system and this is for individual
 
03:40:58.370 --> 03:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
specific technical skill sets that might
 
03:40:59.710 --> 03:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
be needed
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
fy25 increases for salary steps and
 
03:41:05.570 --> 03:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
benefits and increased costs to support
 
03:41:05.580 --> 03:41:07.729 align:start position:0%
benefits and increased costs to support
headquarters

03:41:07.729 --> 03:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
headquarters
 
03:41:11.210 --> 03:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
on page 12 as the division of
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement and this includes
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement licensing education and
 
03:41:17.929 --> 03:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
grants the division is responsible for
 
03:41:20.210 --> 03:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
enforcing alcoholic beverages laws
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
enforcing youth access to liquor and
 
03:41:24.290 --> 03:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
tobacco and providing licensing
 
03:41:26.769 --> 03:41:26.779 align:start position:0%
education and support for over 6 100
 
03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
licensees in FY 22 the division
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
collected over our 19 million in Revenue
 
03:41:36.830 --> 03:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
FY 24 budget is decreasing 6.6 percent
 
03:41:39.290 --> 03:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
due to changes in positions as a result

for salary and steps and benefits
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%

fy24 increase of 20 or 1.7 million is
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
primarily for that additional
 
03:42:12.769 --> 03:42:12.779 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for doit along with

adding an allocation for indirect cost
 
03:42:18.530 --> 03:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
and the two new positions and then fy25
 
03:42:20.929 --> 03:42:20.939 align:start position:0%
is increasing as the others for salary
 
03:42:24.130 --> 03:42:24.140 align:start position:0%

03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
fy24 increase of 5.2 percent or 3.5
 
03:42:48.050 --> 03:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
million is in large part from the
 
03:42:50.090 --> 03:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
increase in technology and hardware and
 
03:42:52.490 --> 03:42:52.500 align:start position:0%

our fy25 3.9 percent or 2.7 million
 
03:43:07.490 --> 03:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
increase is mainly for the salary steps
 
03:43:09.889 --> 03:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
and benefits and the increased cost of
 
03:43:12.830 --> 03:43:12.840 align:start position:0%

03:43:18.660 --> 03:43:19.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:22.010 --> 03:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
page 15 workers comp and unemployment
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
comp workers comp for FY 23 is
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
underfunded and the increase in FY 24 is
 
03:43:30.889 --> 03:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
based on historical Trend the increase
 
03:43:32.809 --> 03:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
is because as we continue to be
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
understaffed and ask more of our
 
03:43:38.809 --> 03:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.769 --> 03:43:41.779 align:start position:0%
and then the last two pages 16 and 17
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
this is the house bill 2 language that
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
we provided last week to give us the
 
03:43:49.729 --> 03:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
authority to transfer funds out of
 
03:43:51.650 --> 03:43:51.660 align:start position:0%

employees incentive program
 
03:43:56.210 --> 03:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
and we would be happy to answer any more
 
03:43:56.220 --> 03:43:58.370 align:start position:0%
and we would be happy to answer any more
questions

03:43:58.370 --> 03:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:44:00.349 --> 03:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire
 
03:44:02.450 --> 03:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you guys for
 
03:44:02.460 --> 03:44:03.530 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you guys for
coming

03:44:03.530 --> 03:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
coming
 
03:44:05.690 --> 03:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
um so in a number of areas I see
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
salaries decrease in fiscal year 24 but
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
increase in 25 which doesn't make sense
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
to me because 24 is the year of the 10
 
03:44:17.929 --> 03:44:17.939 align:start position:0%
increase and 25 is only a 2 percent
 
03:44:17.939 --> 03:44:19.269 align:start position:0%
increase and 25 is only a 2 percent
increase

03:44:19.269 --> 03:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:44:22.670 --> 03:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
we did not include in our agency numbers
 
03:44:25.490 --> 03:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
the 10 in the two percent increase these
 
03:44:27.650 --> 03:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
numbers were based on what we originally
 
03:44:30.670 --> 03:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
submitted um we actually in the
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
governor's phase we didn't have an
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
increase in any of those class lines
 
03:44:34.560 --> 03:44:35.450 align:start position:0%
increase in any of those class lines
either

03:44:35.450 --> 03:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:44:35.460 --> 03:44:36.590 align:start position:0%
either
hmm

03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
so what's actually in here in the
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is it with the 10
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
increase no no
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
because you're separate or it would
 
03:44:49.130 --> 03:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
happen it's just not it I I don't know
 
03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
it they weren't calculated into the
 
03:44:53.570 --> 03:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
expense numbers in these two
 
03:44:53.580 --> 03:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
expense numbers in these two
Appropriations

03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
03:44:57.530 --> 03:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
Mike wants to come with yeah I
 
03:45:00.349 --> 03:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
understand that the 10 increase is go
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to be in the trailer bill
 
03:45:05.090 --> 03:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
a separate appropriation in the trailer
 
03:45:05.100 --> 03:45:06.469 align:start position:0%
a separate appropriation in the trailer
bill

03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
but I thought in some of these cases we
 
03:45:10.610 --> 03:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
were seeing it already in this book no
 
03:45:10.620 --> 03:45:12.590 align:start position:0%
were seeing it already in this book no
no

03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:45:15.950 --> 03:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
from the earlier eight no okay
 
03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
I thought we were told that yeah yeah
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to we have to dig into
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
that a little bit Yeah the numbers
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
didn't change from when we submitted it
 
03:45:26.570 --> 03:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
for the agency phase to the governor's
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
face so that's why on page three
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
we included it in the overall total for
 
03:45:34.849 --> 03:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
our total expenses to be able to show
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
how we come down to that net profit
 
03:45:41.450 --> 03:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
number of 135 million we're anticipating
 
03:45:43.610 --> 03:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
that that 10 and 2 percent will be about
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
3.5 million to a 4 million in 24 and 25.
 
03:45:51.410 --> 03:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
further question yes
 
03:45:51.420 --> 03:45:54.650 align:start position:0%
further question yes
so

03:45:54.650 --> 03:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay so then when when you're having
 
03:46:00.290 --> 03:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
decreases in 24 that's is that layoffs
 
03:46:03.170 --> 03:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
is that no it's due to turnover so as
 
03:46:05.150 --> 03:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
you have people that are uh leaving that
 
03:46:07.190 --> 03:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
are at a higher step in labor grade and
 
03:46:08.990 --> 03:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're being replaced by somebody at a
 
03:46:10.429 --> 03:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
lower step
 
03:46:14.050 --> 03:46:14.060 align:start position:0%
that's primarily gotcha are you planning
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
so when you're getting these 10
 
03:46:18.170 --> 03:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
increases is are you planning to give
 
03:46:21.650 --> 03:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
them to everybody including part-time
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
um we're not giving them it's for
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
full-time employees to 10 okay
 
03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:31.849 --> 03:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you
 
03:46:34.370 --> 03:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you both for being here
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I am intrigued by the employee
 
03:46:38.750 --> 03:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
incentive program and I just have a
 
03:46:41.690 --> 03:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
question on obviously it's largely for
 
03:46:43.130 --> 03:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
what the public sees a retail business
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
right um and so your competitors for
 
03:46:48.670 --> 03:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
hiring are the Walmart's Market Basket
 
03:46:52.070 --> 03:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
those stores are you able or in this
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
budget proposal or do you have what you
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
would need to stay competitive in the
 
03:46:59.450 --> 03:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
hiring process with those other
 
03:47:02.450 --> 03:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
companies that are moving up their pay
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
well as we stated in our overview last
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
week representative we we feel that our
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
employees are underpaid grossly
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
underpaid quite frankly and
 
03:47:16.610 --> 03:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
um given the uh
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are out there in the
 
03:47:22.190 --> 03:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
retail environment between our incentive
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
program and the 10 percent increase that
 
03:47:28.370 --> 03:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
will certainly help us in hiring more
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
employees but we were down we are down
 
03:47:34.190 --> 03:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
84 full-time equivalent employees
 
03:47:36.650 --> 03:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
between full-time and part-time and have
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
been even deeper down
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh and and we're starting to see some of
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
the hiring take place will we be equal
 
03:47:48.590 --> 03:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
to no we won't be
 
03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:51.170 align:start position:0%
to no we won't be
so

03:47:51.170 --> 03:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:53.330 --> 03:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you what's the current
 
03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
rate for an hourly worker it starts
 
03:48:01.929 --> 03:48:01.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.250 --> 03:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.969 --> 03:48:25.979 align:start position:0%
so obviously uh we're always looking or
 
03:48:27.530 --> 03:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
the state's always looking for the most
 
03:48:29.809 --> 03:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
money out of you folks I know it's a a
 
03:48:30.969 --> 03:48:30.979 align:start position:0%
tough job
 
03:48:34.010 --> 03:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
that you have to provide the funds is
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
that I think you had 135 million or
 
03:48:37.319 --> 03:48:38.110 align:start position:0%
that I think you had 135 million or
something

03:48:38.110 --> 03:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
coming back to the general fund
 
03:48:43.610 --> 03:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
somewhere is that doable I know there's
 
03:48:47.690 --> 03:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
been a decline in revenues as of late
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
we certainly think it's doable yes we uh
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know our sales we're meeting plan
 
03:48:55.250 --> 03:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
we're we're meeting the plan that we've
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
put forward so uh our sales have
 
03:49:00.170 --> 03:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
certainly declined for a number of
 
03:49:02.150 --> 03:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
reasons that we went over in the primer
 
03:49:04.849 --> 03:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
last week uh you know obviously the main
 
03:49:07.130 --> 03:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
reason being competition from
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but we're meeting our plan
 
03:49:13.309 --> 03:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
and we're competent with our numbers
 
03:49:17.090 --> 03:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
see on page three we are projecting
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
increasing our sales if you look at
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
column M line one our net sales based on
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
those 24 new positions we're increasing
 
03:49:30.290 --> 03:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
our sales by 32 million because we have
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
we have a full-time equivalent of about
 
03:49:34.729 --> 03:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
a million dollars annually that um a
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
full-time employee produces in the
 
03:49:36.359 --> 03:49:40.309 align:start position:0%
full-time employee produces in the
stores

03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:42.429 --> 03:49:42.439 align:start position:0%
so that was added into the budget as
 
03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
added into the revenue as our
 
03:49:47.330 --> 03:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
projections with those positions in
 
03:49:47.340 --> 03:49:48.410 align:start position:0%
projections with those positions in
place

03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay represent Griffin
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
I personally am a little concerned about
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
the economy going into a tailspin
 
03:49:59.870 --> 03:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
or at least a mild recession
 
03:50:02.469 --> 03:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
you must have a history of
 
03:50:07.010 --> 03:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
sales numbers that happen when when the
 
03:50:09.710 --> 03:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
economy softens what is that history and
 
03:50:12.889 --> 03:50:12.899 align:start position:0%
is it likely to repeat itself if we have
 
03:50:12.899 --> 03:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
is it likely to repeat itself if we have
a

03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
softening of the market well uh having
 
03:50:19.190 --> 03:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
been in the alcohol beverage business
 
03:50:22.849 --> 03:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years I can certainly tell
 
03:50:25.790 --> 03:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
you that uh in in Good Times people
 
03:50:28.450 --> 03:50:28.460 align:start position:0%
drink and in bad times people drink more
 
03:50:33.170 --> 03:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
and our sales are our sales across the
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
board as long as we don't see that our
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
seals will decrease given that people
 
03:50:40.250 --> 03:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
are still coming to New Hampshire and
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
they're still vacationing here as we all
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
know 50 percent of our business comes
 
03:50:47.809 --> 03:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
from across the border if so if our
 
03:50:50.410 --> 03:50:50.420 align:start position:0%
state for some reason becomes less
 
03:50:53.570 --> 03:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
inviting to folks or there's reasons why
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
they don't travel here that would be the
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
only thing that would infect our
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
business but we don't see that happening
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
03:51:04.670 --> 03:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
here's a follow-up to representative
 
03:51:07.010 --> 03:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
Griffin's question I think a few years
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
back you gave us a 10-year run from what
 
03:51:12.050 --> 03:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
it was actually provided to the general
 
03:51:13.190 --> 03:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
fund I don't know if you could put
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
something like that together which would
 
03:51:17.389 --> 03:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
include some of those difficult years I
 
03:51:19.790 --> 03:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
think is a good question from
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
happy to do that
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire so during the
 
03:51:26.330 --> 03:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
pandemic was there less travel and
 
03:51:30.050 --> 03:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
therefore less sales or no no quite
 
03:51:32.450 --> 03:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
quite the contrary oh people were people
 
03:51:34.250 --> 03:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
were home people were working from home
 
03:51:38.110 --> 03:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
and sales spiked maybe less sales to
 
03:51:40.910 --> 03:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
relatively Less sales to out-of-state
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
it it seemed that there was there was a
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
little less but I think people that were
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
traveling what we saw and I think the
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
real estate market will will uh
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
will support is that so many people
 
03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire during that
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
period of time a lot of people moved
 
03:51:58.849 --> 03:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
here I mean you know there was a number
 
03:52:00.530 --> 03:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
of homes for sale in the North country
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are no longer for sale people came
 
03:52:05.330 --> 03:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
here people bought homes that lifted our
 
03:52:05.340 --> 03:52:12.830 align:start position:0%
here people bought homes that lifted our
boat

03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:15.050 --> 03:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
yeah just in general I mean this is a
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
fantastic business right you're you're
 
03:52:20.090 --> 03:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
spending 75 million dollars and taking
 
03:52:20.100 --> 03:52:20.950 align:start position:0%
spending 75 million dollars and taking
in

03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:52:23.570 --> 03:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
215 or something like that right I mean
 
03:52:23.580 --> 03:52:24.010 align:start position:0%
215 or something like that right I mean
it's

03:52:24.010 --> 03:52:24.020 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:52:24.020 --> 03:52:26.050 align:start position:0%
it's
[Laughter]

03:52:26.050 --> 03:52:26.060 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:52:29.210 --> 03:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's no wonder that that somebody can
 
03:52:31.190 --> 03:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
can compete right because they don't
 
03:52:34.250 --> 03:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
need that kind of profit margin I think
 
03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
right well I I think that the state has
 
03:52:38.450 --> 03:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
been has been very gifted with this
 
03:52:40.969 --> 03:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
business since since prohibition and
 
03:52:42.650 --> 03:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
we've continued to make it profitable
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
and have you know quite frankly doubled
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
business in the last 15 years so uh
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
We've created a brand that people now
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
recognize uh and that's something that
 
03:52:55.849 --> 03:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
is the state can be proud of
 
03:53:00.530 --> 03:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
so for my own curiosity can you produce
 
03:53:08.690 --> 03:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
the Delta between what you're paying
 
03:53:11.929 --> 03:53:11.939 align:start position:0%
retails now and what you believe the pay
 
03:53:14.450 --> 03:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
should be for the most competitive to
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
fill the vacancies so that the stores
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
are fully staffed
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
what would that pay per hour look like
 
03:53:23.809 --> 03:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
and what would that budget line need to
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
be well I I think the the pay one of the
 
03:53:29.210 --> 03:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
things that we had requested in House
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 uh that was taken out was on a
 
03:53:36.170 --> 03:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
was some language that allowed us to
 
03:53:39.889 --> 03:53:39.899 align:start position:0%
compensate our retail store employees
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
only just the people out in the outlets
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
with an average wage that was
 
03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
competitive with uh retailers in the
 
03:53:51.290 --> 03:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
state and that would probably be
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
something that as we know would would
 
03:53:57.769 --> 03:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
fluctuate I think that obviously I find
 
03:53:59.690 --> 03:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't not going to do the math
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
here but I would think we would have to
 
03:54:04.010 --> 03:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
be somewhere
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the 1650 to 18 an hour range to
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
compete across the board in the state
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
with that's starting wage part-time
 
03:54:15.840 --> 03:54:18.889 align:start position:0%
with that's starting wage part-time
employees

03:54:18.889 --> 03:54:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
03:54:21.120 --> 03:54:24.469 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
foreign

03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
kimbrells thank you Mr chair you
 
03:54:32.809 --> 03:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that uh adding a new
 
03:54:35.330 --> 03:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
employee is tantamount to increasing the
 
03:54:37.969 --> 03:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
business by about a million dollars
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
um would that also require that a new
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
store be open or by simply adding 28 new
 
03:54:47.210 --> 03:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
people to the existing stores you you
 
03:54:48.889 --> 03:54:48.899 align:start position:0%
predict you to have another million
 
03:54:51.050 --> 03:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
dollars in sales per person correct
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
because right now we were not able to
 
03:54:55.130 --> 03:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
open our stores for the additional hours
 
03:54:58.670 --> 03:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
for the holidays and for seasonal we had
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
to reduce hours and we had to clearly
 
03:55:02.330 --> 03:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
had to close stores so this would get us
 
03:55:04.370 --> 03:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
back up to the Staffing level that we
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
need to really run the stores more
 
03:55:11.090 --> 03:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
further questions I do have one on
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
workman's comp I saw that was up by like
 
03:55:19.729 --> 03:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
86 or something percent do you work with
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
03:55:23.870 --> 03:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
Services as far as your insurance I
 
03:55:26.150 --> 03:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
should know this but I or do you have
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
your own workman's comp carrier and you
 
03:55:30.170 --> 03:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
know we work with risk management
 
03:55:32.450 --> 03:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
history risk management and our HR
 
03:55:34.370 --> 03:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
department it is starting to go down
 
03:55:35.929 --> 03:55:35.939 align:start position:0%
because our HR department has been
 
03:55:37.729 --> 03:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
working very closely with the insurance
 
03:55:40.969 --> 03:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
company on looking into the the cases
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and a new insurance
 
03:55:44.210 --> 03:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
company as well
 
03:55:46.010 --> 03:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thank you
 
03:55:47.929 --> 03:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire so our most
 
03:55:50.809 --> 03:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
claims based on you know bad backs and
 
03:55:52.610 --> 03:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
things like that from lifting and
 
03:55:55.570 --> 03:55:55.580 align:start position:0%
absolute that kind of thing yes okay now
 
03:55:58.250 --> 03:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
you asked for you told you said that you
 
03:55:59.809 --> 03:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
would ask the governor for a couple of
 
03:56:02.809 --> 03:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
specialized positions that weren't
 
03:56:02.819 --> 03:56:04.130 align:start position:0%
specialized positions that weren't
granted

03:56:04.130 --> 03:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
granted
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
right and and you thought you could put
 
03:56:09.410 --> 03:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
them in with no effect on the bottom
 
03:56:12.110 --> 03:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
line correct part of the additional
 
03:56:14.330 --> 03:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for doit
 
03:56:17.210 --> 03:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
they have the two positions yes and we
 
03:56:19.490 --> 03:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
think we could bring back that 500 000
 
03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
of additional prioritized needs in doit
 
03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
and not have a bottom line impact
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
do you want to more detail about what
 
03:56:29.150 --> 03:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
those people would do and
 
03:56:32.510 --> 03:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
well they're technical technical support
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
people so one of them
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
um is a technical support specialist
 
03:56:39.650 --> 03:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
actually both of them are ones for
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
Enterprise architect and it all has to
 
03:56:44.929 --> 03:56:44.939 align:start position:0%
do with our new next-gen system to help
 
03:56:47.410 --> 03:56:47.420 align:start position:0%
support so that they can get
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
specialized training and and be targeted
 
03:56:52.130 --> 03:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
to that because right now we have the
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
two people that are running our current
 
03:56:55.969 --> 03:56:55.979 align:start position:0%
system and we don't want to be in the
 
03:56:58.370 --> 03:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
same situation of you know having more
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
people that understand the new system
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things representative and and
 
03:57:07.250 --> 03:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
not to belabor the point but a 40 year
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
old system that's been run internally by
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission for all these
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
years we're now going to d365 so
 
03:57:18.410 --> 03:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
obviously at The Liquor Commission and
 
03:57:20.510 --> 03:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
in the state there's not a lot of people
 
03:57:22.910 --> 03:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
that have the wherewithal to run a
 
03:57:25.130 --> 03:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
system like that and have that sort of
 
03:57:28.130 --> 03:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
uh education and background so we're
 
03:57:30.050 --> 03:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
looking to go out and hire those people
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
so we can make sure that 35 years from
 
03:57:36.830 --> 03:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
now when someone else redoes the system
 
03:57:38.630 --> 03:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
that they won't have to go through the
 
03:57:40.729 --> 03:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
same things that we're going through now
 
03:57:42.769 --> 03:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that if you don't have
 
03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
these people they would be replaced by
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
Consultants or something like that is I
 
03:57:51.410 --> 03:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
I think if we don't hire these people
 
03:57:54.889 --> 03:57:54.899 align:start position:0%
that we would have to look outside to
 
03:57:57.469 --> 03:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
hire people through CSI which is a
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
company that doit uses to to find
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
somebody of that caliber to help us as
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
we move to the new program to the new
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
platform and the maintenance of the new
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
platform as well
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
so you're essentially going to be
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
expending similar amounts of money
 
03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
whether they're your own employee or
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere yeah that would that's correct
 
03:58:20.880 --> 03:58:22.429 align:start position:0%
elsewhere yeah that would that's correct
okay

03:58:22.429 --> 03:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:28.490 --> 03:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
any questions over there representative
 
03:58:35.929 --> 03:58:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
03:58:37.920 --> 03:58:40.010 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
okay

03:58:40.010 --> 03:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:41.450 --> 03:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
so it looks like we're in pretty good
 
03:58:44.210 --> 03:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
shape so we're just looking for that
 
03:58:45.889 --> 03:58:45.899 align:start position:0%
10-year history
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
and I guess you're going to check on the
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
general funds differences in the 14
 
03:58:51.229 --> 03:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
million whether that's coming out of the
 
03:58:52.969 --> 03:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund or
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
Capital fund or whatever yes
 
03:58:56.330 --> 03:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
yes and I don't think we need to have
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
you back if you could just get those
 
03:59:01.090 --> 03:59:01.100 align:start position:0%
items to the LBA that would be perfect
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much thank you
 
03:59:08.030 --> 03:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.070 --> 03:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry commissioner is it possible
 
03:59:27.410 --> 03:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
you could get something even from the
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
budget director why they didn't support
 
03:59:31.130 --> 03:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
your two requests
 
03:59:33.769 --> 03:59:33.779 align:start position:0%
for the technical positions to technical
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:43.010 --> 03:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
one more item for you uh Mr Hoffman to
 
03:59:49.610 --> 03:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:51.650 --> 03:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
well that went quicker than I thought it
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
should but yeah because the way he
 
03:59:56.410 --> 03:59:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
all right so now you can run to tandy's
 
04:00:39.670 --> 04:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:42.410 --> 04:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
so we could still certainly talk about
 
04:00:46.370 --> 04:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
that okay maybe we could get data about
 
04:00:49.130 --> 04:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
how projects are sized I mean I don't
 
04:00:49.140 --> 04:00:50.450 align:start position:0%
how projects are sized I mean I don't
know

04:00:50.450 --> 04:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:00:52.090 --> 04:00:52.100 align:start position:0%
is it
 
04:00:55.550 --> 04:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously a hundred thousand
 
04:00:57.710 --> 04:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
square foot building versus a single
 
04:01:01.250 --> 04:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:01.260 --> 04:01:02.590 align:start position:0%
 
work

04:01:02.590 --> 04:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
we're still technically supposed to um
 
04:01:09.530 --> 04:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
if we're discussing policy what's that
 
04:01:13.130 --> 04:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
it should be on or off on okay all right
 
04:01:17.150 --> 04:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
well in that case so so this is a tax
 
04:01:19.849 --> 04:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
appeal right so so somebody said your
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
property your property value is X and
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
you say no it isn't it's why right
 
04:01:29.090 --> 04:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's that's the appeal right yeah so
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
so you could
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean so you could say
 
04:01:40.490 --> 04:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know you could step it or you could
 
04:01:42.349 --> 04:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
do a percentage or you could do I mean
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
there's lots of ways you could do it
 
04:01:45.650 --> 04:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
well Dan makes a good point because if
 
04:01:47.689 --> 04:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
you go to Des and you're disturbing like
 
04:01:49.370 --> 04:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand square feet you have
 
04:01:51.410 --> 04:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
to get a site specific permit but
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
anything under that you don't but maybe
 
04:01:55.070 --> 04:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
in this case if you've got a commercial
 
04:01:56.809 --> 04:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
development maybe this should be a
 
04:01:59.929 --> 04:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
higher fee even for a residential or
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
so you have some ideas we can put it in
 
04:02:03.710 --> 04:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
the yeah I mean there are up to a
 
04:02:07.610 --> 04:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
million it's the 65 and over that it's
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
yeah you know a tenth of a percent or
 
04:02:12.050 --> 04:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
something or whatever it is somebody
 
04:02:14.330 --> 04:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
might have a five five thousand dollar
 
04:02:16.370 --> 04:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
difference that they're appealing and
 
04:02:18.530 --> 04:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
others may have two million yeah that's
 
04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
true and and it also that actually would
 
04:02:24.290 --> 04:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
make sense because it would have to be
 
04:02:27.650 --> 04:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
more complicated to do an appeal of a
 
04:02:29.330 --> 04:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
much larger amount for a commercial
 
04:02:31.969 --> 04:02:31.979 align:start position:0%
developer so you could track it to the
 
04:02:34.370 --> 04:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
what it cost you want to put something
 
04:02:34.380 --> 04:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
what it cost you want to put something
together

04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
oh all right does the position have to
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
be self-funded from their fees or how
 
04:02:44.330 --> 04:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
how are the rest of their budgets
 
04:02:46.490 --> 04:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's mostly General it's mostly General
 
04:02:50.210 --> 04:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
so what prohibits I know they've tried
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
to put in for another employee
 
04:02:54.290 --> 04:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
um is that something that was within our
 
04:02:56.090 --> 04:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
realm to say hey they need another
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
employee and provide the general funds
 
04:03:01.729 --> 04:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
for it sure yeah we can do any actually
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
in anything we want okay we write the
 
04:03:08.929 --> 04:03:08.939 align:start position:0%
law right because as opposed to I know
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the day the taxpayer
 
04:03:12.530 --> 04:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
pays for it but as opposed to saying hey
 
04:03:14.570 --> 04:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
let's increase fees everybody hates that
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
you just appropriate it because it's
 
04:03:18.530 --> 04:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
needed it's a position and we give them
 
04:03:20.510 --> 04:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
the general funds for it well you raise
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
a good point like the taxpayer pays for
 
04:03:25.010 --> 04:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
it but the taxpayer is paying for
 
04:03:27.410 --> 04:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
something that is really patently and
 
04:03:30.170 --> 04:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
unfair because if you're only paying 65
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
the other taxpayers have to pick up the
 
04:03:36.050 --> 04:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
cost of running that agency
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
but in in general we don't charge a lot
 
04:03:42.290 --> 04:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
for judges and things like that right
 
04:03:45.769 --> 04:03:45.779 align:start position:0%
Justice is supposed to be part of the
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
cost of General government right so you
 
04:03:50.689 --> 04:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
don't you don't make fees like like in
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
order to go to court it costs you ten
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars or something of
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
a fee right you know
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
so so you don't want to make it too bad
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand
 
04:04:05.710 --> 04:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
you a little some kind of a fee
 
04:04:05.720 --> 04:04:07.330 align:start position:0%
you a little some kind of a fee
discourages

04:04:07.330 --> 04:04:07.340 align:start position:0%
discourages
 
04:04:10.969 --> 04:04:10.979 align:start position:0%
frivolous uh activity right so there's
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
there's some balance there right so yeah
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
I have a
 
04:04:19.250 --> 04:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of background at the Board
 
04:04:21.710 --> 04:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
of tax and land appeals because I was a
 
04:04:21.720 --> 04:04:22.969 align:start position:0%
of tax and land appeals because I was a
selectman

04:04:22.969 --> 04:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
selectman
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
15 years
 
04:04:30.370 --> 04:04:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:33.050 --> 04:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they told us they
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know didn't ever want to see us
 
04:04:34.920 --> 04:04:36.250 align:start position:0%
didn't know didn't ever want to see us
again

04:04:36.250 --> 04:04:36.260 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:04:39.170 --> 04:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
we should settle cases at home
 
04:04:42.650 --> 04:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
but the idea of the idea of the board of
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
tax and landed Fields is I understand
 
04:04:47.809 --> 04:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
that is to keep people from going to
 
04:04:49.809 --> 04:04:49.819 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
04:04:53.570 --> 04:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
and so it should be free really
 
04:04:56.689 --> 04:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
it should be encouraged to use that
 
04:04:59.210 --> 04:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
use that facility rather than go to
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
court well the fee is a little bit too
 
04:05:05.929 --> 04:05:05.939 align:start position:0%
maybe uh stem abuse of it too I mean
 
04:05:07.969 --> 04:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
that there's a balance there so let me
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
know well and it's much more expensive
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
to go to Superior Court overall than it
 
04:05:18.830 --> 04:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:21.050 --> 04:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
now when people go to the they have to
 
04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
land a building they go with a lawyer no
 
04:05:27.050 --> 04:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
not typically no well she said some Pro
 
04:05:29.229 --> 04:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
Se and some maybe not
 
04:05:31.969 --> 04:05:31.979 align:start position:0%
probably probably depends on how much
 
04:05:36.290 --> 04:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
with your experience they make Fair
 
04:05:42.769 --> 04:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
my my experience was very positive there
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
really but you know I I usually think
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
they focus in on the on the facts at
 
04:05:52.250 --> 04:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
least as Lisa and we didn't always win
 
04:05:52.260 --> 04:05:53.510 align:start position:0%
least as Lisa and we didn't always win
but

04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:05:57.170 --> 04:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh it it worked very efficiently I don't
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
know whether it still does or not
 
04:06:01.849 --> 04:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
because it's been years now since I've
 
04:06:04.729 --> 04:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
been there but when we were using it it
 
04:06:07.370 --> 04:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
worked very very well well it's got to
 
04:06:08.450 --> 04:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
be efficient well I'm going to say
 
04:06:11.830 --> 04:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicate yeah with very few resources
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
right and they hadn't raised the fee
 
04:06:17.570 --> 04:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
since 77. yeah so if you think even of
 
04:06:17.580 --> 04:06:19.250 align:start position:0%
since 77. yeah so if you think even of
inflation

04:06:19.250 --> 04:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
04:06:21.050 --> 04:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah didn't you come up representative
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
Sweeney with sounds like 300 yeah it was
 
04:06:27.250 --> 04:06:27.260 align:start position:0%
uh on my phone earlier it was
 
04:06:31.269 --> 04:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
65.77 is 360 uh
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
360.25 today that's not a proposal I'm
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:40.560 --> 04:06:42.769 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:06:42.769 --> 04:06:42.779 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire do you want to
 
04:06:46.490 --> 04:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
come up with something for us to beat
 
04:06:49.250 --> 04:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
around that'll be great
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll take a short recess
 
04:06:57.050 --> 04:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:00.410 --> 04:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:00.420 --> 04:07:49.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.560 --> 04:28:14.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:28:14.410 --> 04:28:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
so we'll open up the uh work session
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Employment
 
04:28:20.279 --> 04:28:22.910 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Employment
Security

04:28:22.910 --> 04:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:27.410 --> 04:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
and this is on page 535 it starts and
 
04:28:29.570 --> 04:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
another one of those agencies I don't
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
believe you take any of our general
 
04:28:33.370 --> 04:28:33.380 align:start position:0%
funds right yeah
 
04:28:36.889 --> 04:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
yes you stole my thunder we are very
 
04:28:38.750 --> 04:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
proud to be able to sit here and tell
 
04:28:41.570 --> 04:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
you that we have zero General funds
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
um usually it doesn't allow us to stand
 
04:28:45.769 --> 04:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
up and walk out but
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.210 --> 04:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
well if you could roll introduce
 
04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:54.960 align:start position:0%

04:28:56.809 --> 04:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
difficult to spell
 
04:29:00.790 --> 04:29:00.800 align:start position:0%

administ

04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%

04:29:15.889 --> 04:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
commissioner capatus George was
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly ill today nothing to do
 
04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
with all of you more to do with spending
 
04:29:22.910 --> 04:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
spending time with his grandchildren and
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
what they bring home from school but
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
um he unfortunately was not able to make
 
04:29:31.250 --> 04:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.290 --> 04:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
um so we did have a narrative that we
 
04:29:35.450 --> 04:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
had uh provided
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
um where on page I believe 535 on the
 
04:29:41.929 --> 04:29:41.939 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
um we can do an abbreviated uh version
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
of of the narrative or we can go right
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
into questions or particular issues that
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
um the members would like to discuss
 
04:29:55.610 --> 04:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
um however you'd like to do that
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
while you've gone to the effort of
 
04:29:59.210 --> 04:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
putting this together so uh you should
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
take us through it thank you
 
04:30:03.170 --> 04:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:30:07.849 --> 04:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
our 24 25 budget
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
provides a sufficient level of funding
 
04:30:12.410 --> 04:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
so that we'll continue to be able to
 
04:30:15.290 --> 04:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
provide exceptional service in our our
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
core programs
 
04:30:17.760 --> 04:30:18.950 align:start position:0%
core programs
um

04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
we have zero General funds in the agency
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
so we are federally funded and other
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
funds those other funds are a mixture of
 
04:30:30.800 --> 04:30:32.889 align:start position:0%
funds those other funds are a mixture of
both

04:30:32.889 --> 04:30:32.899 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance tax payments from
 
04:30:40.929 --> 04:30:40.939 align:start position:0%
employers and income received from other
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
agencies and organizations for services
 
04:30:48.050 --> 04:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
that we provide to them but zero General
 
04:30:48.060 --> 04:30:50.830 align:start position:0%
that we provide to them but zero General
funds

04:30:50.830 --> 04:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.809 --> 04:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:30:56.030 --> 04:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
portion of the unemployment insurance
 
04:30:58.610 --> 04:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
tax payments from employers the The
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
Lion's Share of that payment from
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
employers does go into the unemployment
 
04:31:04.250 --> 04:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
compensation trust fund from which
 
04:31:05.929 --> 04:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
benefits are paid
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and there is a administrative
 
04:31:11.450 --> 04:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
contribution that is set aside from that
 
04:31:14.210 --> 04:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
from each quarterly payment that
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
supports a portion of the operational
 
04:31:24.889 --> 04:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:27.170 --> 04:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
percentage on that assessment it's the
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
administrative contribution is point
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
four percent right now and that was
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
recently increased uh two budgets ago
 
04:31:35.040 --> 04:31:36.349 align:start position:0%
recently increased uh two budgets ago
correct

04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:31:38.389 --> 04:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
irrespective of the unemployment rate
 
04:31:43.550 --> 04:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
the employee employer uh pays correct so
 
04:31:43.560 --> 04:31:44.809 align:start position:0%
the employee employer uh pays correct so
the

04:31:44.809 --> 04:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
um the first point four percent
 
04:31:50.689 --> 04:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
um paid by an employer goes towards the
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
administrative contribution
 
04:31:54.050 --> 04:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
um there are the rest of that goes to
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
the unemployment compensation trust fund
 
04:31:59.570 --> 04:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
and that the rate at which they pay is
 
04:32:02.330 --> 04:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
based upon experience with the
 
04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
is that point four percent of salary or
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
point four percent of what they pay into
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
the system
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so it's point so the the way that
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
their tax rate is set is it's easiest to
 
04:32:21.710 --> 04:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
to look at a new employer so a new
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
employer registers and they come in with
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
a 2.7 tax rate set for their first four
 
04:32:31.370 --> 04:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
quarters and that's 2.7 paid on the
 
04:32:33.889 --> 04:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
first fourteen thousand dollars in
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
annual wages for each employee
 
04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
um so the the point four
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
um is similarly applicable it goes on
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
the 0.4 of that first fourteen thousand
 
04:32:48.050 --> 04:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
dollars in annual wages paid each
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
employee employers largely pay most of
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
that that UI tax is associated with
 
04:32:56.570 --> 04:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
wages paid in the first quarter
 
04:32:58.729 --> 04:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
um with some coming in from the second
 
04:33:00.590 --> 04:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
quarter and then your seasonal
 
04:33:02.929 --> 04:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
businesses uh pay an associate
 
04:33:05.929 --> 04:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
association with whatever season their
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
their work their work Workforce is heavy
 
04:33:11.209 --> 04:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
so you're saying they're paying 3.1
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
percent on that 14 000 no no they're
 
04:33:17.689 --> 04:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
they're two it's 2.7 but the the 0.4 of
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
that goes to the administrative contract
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and 2.3 goes into the phone correct I
 
04:33:25.490 --> 04:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.949 --> 04:33:27.959 align:start position:0%
um high level of our budget it's very
 
04:33:30.890 --> 04:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
much uh Personnel heavy
 
04:33:34.490 --> 04:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
um with about 60 of our budget
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
um that is in order to
 
04:33:37.199 --> 04:33:37.929 align:start position:0%
um that is in order to
um

04:33:37.929 --> 04:33:37.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
be able to successfully administer our
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
core programs both the unemployment
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
insurance program so not only the
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
um adjudication of unemployment claims
 
04:33:50.760 --> 04:33:52.131 align:start position:0%
um adjudication of unemployment claims
and

04:33:52.131 --> 04:33:52.141 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:54.410 --> 04:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
um the appeals that could uh follow from
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
that and having the staff associated
 
04:33:58.010 --> 04:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
with being able to implement that timely
 
04:34:01.010 --> 04:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
and successfully but also the New
 
04:34:02.750 --> 04:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Works One-Stop centers that
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
are located throughout the state we
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
operate those centers
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
um uh with both our staff partner agency
 
04:34:10.080 --> 04:34:11.449 align:start position:0%
um uh with both our staff partner agency
staff

04:34:11.449 --> 04:34:11.459 align:start position:0%
staff
 
04:34:12.529 --> 04:34:12.539 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:34:15.289 --> 04:34:15.299 align:start position:0%
um our budget's about 60 percent uh
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
Personnel costs we have another 23
 
04:34:21.289 --> 04:34:21.299 align:start position:0%
percent of our budget that is I.T
 
04:34:21.299 --> 04:34:22.429 align:start position:0%
percent of our budget that is I.T
related

04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
related
 
04:34:26.810 --> 04:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh both for the uh services that we
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
receive from doit we have uh 17
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
embedded doit staff that actually sit
 
04:34:38.029 --> 04:34:38.039 align:start position:0%
over with uh with Employment Security
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
they are providing
 
04:34:43.310 --> 04:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
um a hundred percent of their time to
 
04:34:45.051 --> 04:34:45.061 align:start position:0%
the department and then we have some
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
shared service costs with doit we also
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
have support and maintenance related
 
04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
costs for the
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
software and Hardware from which the
 
04:35:02.209 --> 04:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
unemployment program is run along with
 
04:35:04.269 --> 04:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
our job match system
 
04:35:07.150 --> 04:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
and Associated
 
04:35:11.631 --> 04:35:11.641 align:start position:0%
software and technology that makes those
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
systems operational so very much I.T
 
04:35:19.449 --> 04:35:19.459 align:start position:0%
dependent from a staffing perspective so
 
04:35:25.330 --> 04:35:25.340 align:start position:0%
we have 293 authorized positions in the
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
24-25 budget plus another 26 temporary
 
04:35:30.240 --> 04:35:32.170 align:start position:0%
24-25 budget plus another 26 temporary
positions

04:35:32.170 --> 04:35:32.180 align:start position:0%
positions
 
04:35:37.209 --> 04:35:37.219 align:start position:0%
currently we have 262 filled positions
 
04:35:42.769 --> 04:35:42.779 align:start position:0%
and 55 positions that are vacant so
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the 55 vacant that
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
would be about a 17 vacancy rate however
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
only 27 of those positions are an active
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
recruitment right now so it's about a
 
04:35:58.490 --> 04:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
nine percent vacancy rate the other
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
positions that are that are budgeted for
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
that are not an active recruitment that
 
04:36:05.689 --> 04:36:05.699 align:start position:0%
are vacant that is how we have
 
04:36:05.699 --> 04:36:06.910 align:start position:0%
are vacant that is how we have
historically

04:36:06.910 --> 04:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
historically
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
approached each budget cycle so that
 
04:36:12.769 --> 04:36:12.779 align:start position:0%
we're ready and can increase our
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
staffing as needed in order to respond
 
04:36:19.369 --> 04:36:19.379 align:start position:0%
to an economic downturn so
 
04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
um as the economy goes through Cycles
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
every seven years or so we encounter a
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
downturn that really increases our level
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
of service we need to provide to the
 
04:36:34.029 --> 04:36:34.039 align:start position:0%
public not only from an Unemployment
 
04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program perspective but all
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
of those One-Stop centers
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
then need to have the Staffing in order
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
04:36:46.010 --> 04:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
um provide services to the individuals
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
that are coming in so that's what we're
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
looking at right now for Staffing as
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
we'd indicated before there are no
 
04:36:58.449 --> 04:36:58.459 align:start position:0%
General funds associated with our budget
 
04:37:00.609 --> 04:37:00.619 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:37:02.689 --> 04:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
federally funded through grants
 
04:37:04.609 --> 04:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
associated with the programs that we
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
administer the largest of those is the
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance program grants
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
then we have an assortment of grants for
 
04:37:16.369 --> 04:37:16.379 align:start position:0%
programs that we administer in
 
04:37:17.810 --> 04:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
partnership with the Bureau of Labor
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
Statistics for our economic and labor
 
04:37:22.090 --> 04:37:22.100 align:start position:0%
market information group
 
04:37:25.970 --> 04:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
and our re-employment programs as well
 
04:37:30.109 --> 04:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
so programs that staff administer out in
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
those One-Stop centers assisting
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
individuals connect with hiring
 
04:37:37.010 --> 04:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
employers or connecting with training
 
04:37:40.369 --> 04:37:40.379 align:start position:0%
opportunities and those are our federal
 
04:37:42.529 --> 04:37:42.539 align:start position:0%
grants that we receive
 
04:37:46.131 --> 04:37:46.141 align:start position:0%
and then the other other agency income
 
04:37:47.869 --> 04:37:47.879 align:start position:0%
that we receive is for an assortment of
 
04:37:49.609 --> 04:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
services that we provide
 
04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
to other agencies having to do in some
 
04:37:55.789 --> 04:37:55.799 align:start position:0%
instances with data that we were able to
 
04:37:57.650 --> 04:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
provide to them
 
04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:01.141 align:start position:0%
um an example of that is with
 
04:38:03.709 --> 04:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
a partnership with business and economic
 
04:38:07.310 --> 04:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
Affairs where we actually provide the
 
04:38:09.709 --> 04:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
qualitative data on looking at how
 
04:38:11.929 --> 04:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
people that have completed training
 
04:38:15.289 --> 04:38:15.299 align:start position:0%
through federally funded wioa funded
 
04:38:17.631 --> 04:38:17.641 align:start position:0%
programs how well they are doing after
 
04:38:19.131 --> 04:38:19.141 align:start position:0%
that training how quickly they find
 
04:38:22.209 --> 04:38:22.219 align:start position:0%
employment we we thought we provide that
 
04:38:26.449 --> 04:38:26.459 align:start position:0%
data and then we also have an assortment
 
04:38:28.609 --> 04:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
of services in conjunction with Health
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
and Human Services on looking and
 
04:38:36.170 --> 04:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
Reporting on new hires to assist with
 
04:38:39.769 --> 04:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
child support enforcement and things of
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
that nature
 
04:38:41.160 --> 04:38:42.470 align:start position:0%
that nature
so

04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
um with that all being said we can
 
04:38:49.490 --> 04:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
certainly get into some details on any
 
04:38:52.490 --> 04:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
of areas of the recommended budget that
 
04:38:54.590 --> 04:38:54.600 align:start position:0%

04:40:11.570 --> 04:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
they are the administrative Agency for
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
those wioa programs for the state they
 
04:40:17.868 --> 04:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
then through the memorandum of
 
04:40:19.490 --> 04:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
understanding designate Employment
 
04:40:23.930 --> 04:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
Security to both be the One-Stop
 
04:40:26.230 --> 04:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
operator for the the
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
12 offices throughout the state the New
 
04:40:30.170 --> 04:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Works offices where those
 
04:40:32.630 --> 04:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
programs get delivered out of and we
 
04:40:34.730 --> 04:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
administer the dislocated worker program
 
04:40:38.750 --> 04:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
so that is Staff in those one stops that
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
works with individuals recently
 
04:40:42.530 --> 04:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
unemployed connecting them with training
 
04:40:44.208 --> 04:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
operations because you're connected with
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
unemployed like people it's a yeah I see
 
04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
so it's a you know as individuals file
 
04:40:52.970 --> 04:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh for benefits they then get invited in
 
04:40:55.610 --> 04:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
for an assortment of uh workshops and
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
one-on-one sessions with our staff at
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
which time uh we're then able to make
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
them aware of the various programs that
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
we have that can help connect them with
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
training and help connect them with
 
04:41:08.930 --> 04:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
hiring employers and dislocated work the
 
04:41:11.150 --> 04:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
dislocated worker program that's
 
04:41:13.130 --> 04:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
federally funded and comes through Bea
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
is one of those programs
 
04:41:15.240 --> 04:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
is one of those programs
okay

04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so revolving funds that must
 
04:41:24.650 --> 04:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
be this 2.7 percent yes okay correct why
 
04:41:27.470 --> 04:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
is there a big jump of about 3 million
 
04:41:31.850 --> 04:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
um the the anticipated increase
 
04:41:35.570 --> 04:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
um in the increase that we've been
 
04:41:38.030 --> 04:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
seeing in the the administrative
 
04:41:40.010 --> 04:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
contribution funds
 
04:41:43.610 --> 04:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
um largely driven by the additional
 
04:41:46.128 --> 04:41:46.138 align:start position:0%
employers that have registered in the
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
State uh since going back to
 
04:41:50.570 --> 04:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
if we go back to the first quarter of
 
04:41:53.690 --> 04:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
2020 to compare where we currently are
 
04:41:57.770 --> 04:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
we've added about 9 000 employers
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
um to the state so it's about a 20
 
04:42:02.930 --> 04:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
increase those employers then contribute
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
both to with the administrative
 
04:42:08.570 --> 04:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
contribution and they contribute as well
 
04:42:10.490 --> 04:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
to the unemployment trust fund which is
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
back up
 
04:42:14.570 --> 04:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
um about 60 million above where it was
 
04:42:17.330 --> 04:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic so we started the
 
04:42:19.970 --> 04:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic with about 310 million dollars
 
04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
in the unemployment trust fund and we
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
have about 360 million dollars in that
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
fund now so that increase employers both
 
04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
drives up the trust fund out of which
 
04:42:32.448 --> 04:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
benefits are paid in the administrative
 
04:42:34.730 --> 04:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
contribution that provides support to
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
do you start to lower the 2.4 percent
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
when the fund gets to some level
 
04:42:46.610 --> 04:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
um yeah so the the solvency controls for
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
the the trust fund are are built in
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
statute so the way it's done differently
 
04:42:54.590 --> 04:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
um the solvency controls are determined
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
by the balance in the trust fund so
 
04:43:06.890 --> 04:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
um at uh 250 million dollars if the
 
04:43:08.930 --> 04:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
trust fund is able to maintain that for
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
an entire quarter employers then the
 
04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
next quarter receive a 0.5 percent
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
reduction to their tax rates so that 2.7
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
percent new employer would go down to
 
04:43:21.550 --> 04:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
2.2 percent
 
04:43:25.250 --> 04:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
if the fund maintains 350 million
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
dollars for an entire quarter those
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
employers get a one percent reduction to
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
their rate and then when the fund
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
maintains 400 million those employers
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
get a 1.5 percent reduction to their tax
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
rates so that 1.5 is the maximum
 
04:43:41.400 --> 04:43:43.128 align:start position:0%
rates so that 1.5 is the maximum
reduction

04:43:43.128 --> 04:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
04:43:46.030 --> 04:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
um they are those thresholds are
 
04:43:50.330 --> 04:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
determined to be the levels at which the
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
fund can afford to slow down its growth
 
04:43:55.510 --> 04:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
and to stop its growth
 
04:43:58.490 --> 04:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
when when we look at trust fund solvency
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire like all other states we
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
get graded by the U.S Department of
 
04:44:07.208 --> 04:44:07.218 align:start position:0%
Labor each year prior to the the
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic we were considered to have a
 
04:44:12.288 --> 04:44:12.298 align:start position:0%
solvent trust fund
 
04:44:15.770 --> 04:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
um last report that came out in April of
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
last year we were not and that was
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
largely because of the pandemic
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
we have since that time seen explosive
 
04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
growth in the unemployment compensation
 
04:44:31.250 --> 04:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
trust fund at the time of our last
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
solvency score I think the fund was at
 
04:44:37.850 --> 04:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
190 million dollars we're now at 360. so
 
04:44:40.128 --> 04:44:40.138 align:start position:0%
I anticipate that when the next report
 
04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
comes out from the US Department of
 
04:44:44.090 --> 04:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
Labor in April of this year that they'll
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
find New Hampshire to have a more
 
04:44:48.530 --> 04:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
solvent trust fund than we even did
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
before uh before the pandemic but that's
 
04:44:55.128 --> 04:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
how those how rates get lowered
 
04:44:57.530 --> 04:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
um as a result of the balance and the
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
trust fund being determined sufficient
 
04:45:01.490 --> 04:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
to support what
 
04:45:03.770 --> 04:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
is anticipated to be the the next round
 
04:45:03.780 --> 04:45:05.170 align:start position:0%
is anticipated to be the the next round
of

04:45:05.170 --> 04:45:05.180 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:45:08.330 --> 04:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
increased Demand on the on the benefit
 
04:45:08.340 --> 04:45:09.350 align:start position:0%
increased Demand on the on the benefit
system

04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:45:13.970 --> 04:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
our benefits to unemployed persons fixed
 
04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts also in law or are they
 
04:45:20.208 --> 04:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
no they are okay then correct okay yes
 
04:45:20.218 --> 04:45:21.288 align:start position:0%
no they are okay then correct okay yes
so

04:45:21.288 --> 04:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:21.298 --> 04:45:22.730 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
um weekly benefit amount is set by
 
04:45:28.730 --> 04:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
Statute and it's tied to how much you
 
04:45:31.610 --> 04:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
earned during the four quarters of your
 
04:45:35.330 --> 04:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
base period so when when you file a
 
04:45:38.448 --> 04:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
claim uh for unemployment you need two
 
04:45:40.850 --> 04:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
things in order to be eligible one is
 
04:45:42.650 --> 04:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
you need to have a qualifying separation
 
04:45:44.570 --> 04:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
so you need to be unemployed through no
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
fault of your own most common situation
 
04:45:49.490 --> 04:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
being a layoff but you also need to have
 
04:45:51.288 --> 04:45:51.298 align:start position:0%
demonstrated a sufficient level of
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
attachment to the labor market labor to
 
04:45:55.730 --> 04:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
the labor force and you need to have at
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
least twenty eight hundred dollars in
 
04:45:59.208 --> 04:45:59.218 align:start position:0%
earnings during your four quarter base
 
04:45:59.218 --> 04:46:00.830 align:start position:0%
earnings during your four quarter base
period

04:46:00.830 --> 04:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and that 2800 needs to be divided up
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
so it in at least two quarters you had
 
04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
fourteen hundred dollars in earnings
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
then the once the the separation
 
04:46:14.570 --> 04:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
um eligibility requirement is met in the
 
04:46:14.580 --> 04:46:15.830 align:start position:0%
um eligibility requirement is met in the
earning

04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
earning
 
04:46:18.288 --> 04:46:18.298 align:start position:0%
um eligibility requirement is met we
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
then look at the statutory table to see
 
04:46:23.090 --> 04:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay how much did you earn in those four
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
quarters and then that corresponds to a
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount that you are
 
04:46:30.890 --> 04:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
eligible for for up to 26 weeks so for
 
04:46:33.530 --> 04:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
example the highest weekly benefit
 
04:46:37.310 --> 04:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
amount in New Hampshire is 427 dollars
 
04:46:40.610 --> 04:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
um that corresponds corresponds to base
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
period earnings of forty one thousand
 
04:46:44.930 --> 04:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
um it's been quite some time since that
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
has has been touched
 
04:46:53.690 --> 04:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
um that 427 was added in 2007.
 
04:46:56.690 --> 04:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
um uh but if you are earning 41.5 in
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
your base period 427 is your weekly
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
benefit amount if you're earning a
 
04:47:02.570 --> 04:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in your base
 
04:47:02.580 --> 04:47:03.770 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in your base
period

04:47:03.770 --> 04:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:47:07.010 --> 04:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
um 427 is that amount you're eligible
 
04:47:09.770 --> 04:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
for that for 26 weeks on average right
 
04:47:09.780 --> 04:47:10.788 align:start position:0%
for that for 26 weeks on average right
now

04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:47:13.250 --> 04:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
um people are collecting for 10 weeks
 
04:47:16.610 --> 04:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
which is the fifth lowest duration in
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
the country
 
04:47:19.368 --> 04:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
um we actually have the lowest
 
04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rate in the country right now
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
about eight percent of people filing
 
04:47:26.330 --> 04:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
actually use all of their weeks so less
 
04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
than one in ten people use all the weeks
 
04:47:28.200 --> 04:47:29.510 align:start position:0%
than one in ten people use all the weeks
available

04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:47:29.520 --> 04:47:30.170 align:start position:0%
available
um

04:47:30.170 --> 04:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:33.050 --> 04:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
in order to access the benefits for all
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
those weeks you need to be able to work
 
04:47:37.970 --> 04:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
available to work and you need to be
 
04:47:41.090 --> 04:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
completing a work search with each
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
weekly claim that you file
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:47:48.110 --> 04:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
you really know your stuff represents
 
04:47:49.970 --> 04:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
Sweeney I think I saw you thank you Mr
 
04:47:52.610 --> 04:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you both for being here
 
04:47:56.750 --> 04:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
um line 18 in the budget for overtime uh
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
1.6 million in 2022 I imagine the 27
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
vacancies drove that overtime use and
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're just hoping that we fill those for
 
04:48:08.570 --> 04:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
the future
 
04:48:10.250 --> 04:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
yeah we
 
04:48:13.730 --> 04:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
um it's a good uh line item to draw
 
04:48:15.650 --> 04:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
04:48:18.650 --> 04:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
um at the in the initial part of the the
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
pandemic because of all of the various
 
04:48:24.530 --> 04:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
things that were going on and being in
 
04:48:27.650 --> 04:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
the middle of a Public Health crisis we
 
04:48:29.570 --> 04:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
weren't eight we we had to respond
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
overnight essentially
 
04:48:33.770 --> 04:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
um and weren't able to staff up like we
 
04:48:36.650 --> 04:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
would with a traditional recession that
 
04:48:39.050 --> 04:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
you have a little bit more lead time
 
04:48:40.850 --> 04:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
um to prepare for
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
um so we really leaned on our staff
 
04:48:46.128 --> 04:48:46.138 align:start position:0%
quite heavily at one point I think was
 
04:48:49.730 --> 04:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
in April of of 2020 we actually had
 
04:48:53.810 --> 04:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
about 95 uh the equivalent in overtime
 
04:48:57.530 --> 04:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
hours of 95 additional ftes
 
04:48:59.930 --> 04:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
um our our people were
 
04:49:03.410 --> 04:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
um uh uh living within the walls of our
 
04:49:06.770 --> 04:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
buildings and providing Services
 
04:49:10.610 --> 04:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
um we obviously with uh the the pandemic
 
04:49:14.090 --> 04:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
related workloads uh coming down
 
04:49:16.128 --> 04:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
um adjusting our staffing
 
04:49:17.930 --> 04:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
um as appropriate
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
um that anticipated need as as
 
04:49:24.550 --> 04:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
down significantly
 
04:49:27.470 --> 04:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
but we we're able to we relied very
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
heavily upon our staff our existing
 
04:49:32.208 --> 04:49:32.218 align:start position:0%
staff at the beginning of the pandemic
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're able to bring on some additional
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
staff to assist where the workload was
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
at each time whether it be in initial
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
claims or an appeals
 
04:49:44.090 --> 04:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
um or in within the services that the
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
the local office the New Hampshire Works
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
One-Stop center staff were providing but
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
we think we're we're we're staffed
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
um uh very really well right now for the
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
the level of services we're providing
 
04:50:01.730 --> 04:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
and if we were to need additional staff
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
then we do have the requested vacant
 
04:50:07.368 --> 04:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
funded positions which we would then
 
04:50:09.050 --> 04:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
fill hopefully we wouldn't need to do
 
04:50:11.330 --> 04:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
things the way we did them back in in
 
04:50:14.330 --> 04:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
2020 and having to ramp up our services
 
04:50:19.250 --> 04:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you
 
04:50:21.520 --> 04:50:22.730 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you
[Music]

04:50:22.730 --> 04:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:50:28.010 --> 04:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
to help some constituents some relatives
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't even know how you did
 
04:50:36.170 --> 04:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
what you did and there were a couple of
 
04:50:38.570 --> 04:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
times I reached out to you and you got
 
04:50:41.930 --> 04:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
things turned around and it's just I bet
 
04:50:43.610 --> 04:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
you look back at it now and you can't
 
04:50:46.128 --> 04:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
believe what you had to do I just
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
wondered so thank you very much I just
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
want to ask you do you have much problem
 
04:50:54.170 --> 04:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
with employers paying into the fund what
 
04:50:58.190 --> 04:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
they need to pay and if you do how do
 
04:51:01.970 --> 04:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
you pursue something like that
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um the the compliance rate for employers
 
04:51:07.970 --> 04:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
is uh I don't I can um get you those
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
numbers but the compliance rate is
 
04:51:13.010 --> 04:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
remarkably uh good in New Hampshire
 
04:51:14.570 --> 04:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
um but we do have we do have those
 
04:51:17.690 --> 04:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
employers that uh either through just
 
04:51:20.390 --> 04:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
being unaware or um not understanding
 
04:51:22.490 --> 04:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
the requirements in New Hampshire that
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't register
 
04:51:27.770 --> 04:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
um and uh will occasionally uh receive a
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
claim for which we have no reported
 
04:51:29.280 --> 04:51:30.288 align:start position:0%
claim for which we have no reported
wages

04:51:30.288 --> 04:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
wages
 
04:51:34.550 --> 04:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and that that then triggers our tax
 
04:51:38.030 --> 04:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
unit and our field staff uh that they
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
then have a conversation with that
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
employer get them registered make sure
 
04:51:45.410 --> 04:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
that we're going uh back to the the
 
04:51:47.690 --> 04:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
quarter in which they should have
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
registered with us get them in at the
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate tax rate and then for those
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
that are unable or uh that do not pay
 
04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
their quarterly tax we do have a
 
04:52:00.530 --> 04:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
Collections Unit that our Collections
 
04:52:03.010 --> 04:52:03.020 align:start position:0%
Unit uh does pursue
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
employer tax debt they pursue that very
 
04:52:06.240 --> 04:52:08.448 align:start position:0%
employer tax debt they pursue that very
aggressively

04:52:08.448 --> 04:52:08.458 align:start position:0%
aggressively
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
um with an assortment of of collection
 
04:52:11.218 --> 04:52:12.830 align:start position:0%
um with an assortment of of collection
tools

04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
tools
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
um hopefully it can be managed with a
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
with a payment agreement with the
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
employer if they're unable to to pay
 
04:52:21.650 --> 04:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
what they owe us at that time but we do
 
04:52:23.930 --> 04:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
have more aggressive Tools in statute I
 
04:52:25.690 --> 04:52:25.700 align:start position:0%
mean that unit also handles on
 
04:52:27.948 --> 04:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
overpayment collection as well from
 
04:52:29.868 --> 04:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
individuals that
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
um through
 
04:52:35.448 --> 04:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
information that uh was material
 
04:52:38.090 --> 04:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
materially inaccurate that they provided
 
04:52:39.770 --> 04:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
to us that created eligibility and
 
04:52:41.330 --> 04:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
they're found to not have been paid
 
04:52:44.050 --> 04:52:44.060 align:start position:0%
correctly that Collections Unit also
 
04:52:46.250 --> 04:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
pursues collection of those types of
 
04:52:47.750 --> 04:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
debts as well
 
04:52:50.330 --> 04:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
just before so what about the flip side
 
04:52:53.390 --> 04:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
what about uh fraudulent claims do you
 
04:52:56.690 --> 04:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
see much of that or you hear a lot about
 
04:53:00.170 --> 04:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
that I wondered what the reality was
 
04:53:04.250 --> 04:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
and um there is
 
04:53:07.970 --> 04:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
with the the types of fraud that the
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
unemployment program has historically
 
04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
experienced and and we continue to
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
experience historically it's been
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
earnings related fraud so individuals
 
04:53:20.090 --> 04:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
who have a qualifying separation from
 
04:53:20.100 --> 04:53:21.590 align:start position:0%
who have a qualifying separation from
employment

04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
um and they are they are rightfully
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
collecting go back to work and they they
 
04:53:29.868 --> 04:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
don't feel the need to report the new
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
job and the earnings associated with
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
that new job to the department they
 
04:53:36.288 --> 04:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
continue to collect benefits despite us
 
04:53:38.930 --> 04:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
asking very clearly on that Weekly
 
04:53:40.670 --> 04:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
application for benefits whether they
 
04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
were working and whether they had any
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
earnings associated with work for those
 
04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
folks we have a fraud investigative unit
 
04:53:51.410 --> 04:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
and we have a relationship with the
 
04:53:52.970 --> 04:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office where we
 
04:53:55.850 --> 04:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
actually fund a position that sits
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
within the Attorney General's office
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
criminal Bureau and they prosecute
 
04:54:02.090 --> 04:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
unemployment fraud and that is their
 
04:54:05.810 --> 04:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
sole responsibility uh so the earnings
 
04:54:08.090 --> 04:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
fraud we take very seriously we go after
 
04:54:10.850 --> 04:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
those individuals aggressively
 
04:54:12.550 --> 04:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
um we try to
 
04:54:16.128 --> 04:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can use that those
 
04:54:18.530 --> 04:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
cases that are prosecuted as much of a
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
deterrent as possible when individuals
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
come in with a new claim and they sit
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
through one of our workshops we remind
 
04:54:26.690 --> 04:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
them about their responsibilities and we
 
04:54:28.850 --> 04:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
show them what happens when you don't
 
04:54:30.050 --> 04:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
follow through with those
 
04:54:32.570 --> 04:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so we try to do as much
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have those overpayments
 
04:54:38.570 --> 04:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
coming out of the trust fund so that we
 
04:54:40.250 --> 04:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
can keep those dollars in the trust fund
 
04:54:41.650 --> 04:54:41.660 align:start position:0%
but it still happens
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic though the fraud was
 
04:54:46.610 --> 04:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
different the fraud that we experience
 
04:54:48.590 --> 04:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
just like every other state although we
 
04:54:50.090 --> 04:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
handled it differently than other states
 
04:54:52.730 --> 04:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
the fraud was more identity theft
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
related fraud so it wasn't fraud being
 
04:54:56.810 --> 04:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
committed by people here in New
 
04:54:59.868 --> 04:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that through just the desire
 
04:55:01.788 --> 04:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
to have their unemployment benefit plus
 
04:55:04.250 --> 04:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
their new wages were failing to report
 
04:55:07.208 --> 04:55:07.218 align:start position:0%
things to us these are
 
04:55:09.410 --> 04:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
out of state out of country
 
04:55:11.868 --> 04:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
organizations that were using previously
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
could be you know there are a a lot of
 
04:55:22.610 --> 04:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
individuals that would be contacting us
 
04:55:24.410 --> 04:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
throughout the throughout the the
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic asking us about having received
 
04:55:28.610 --> 04:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
a notice saying but I've never filed a
 
04:55:30.530 --> 04:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
claim what is this notice asking me
 
04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
about the claim that I filed
 
04:55:35.810 --> 04:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
um so that was
 
04:55:38.890 --> 04:55:38.900 align:start position:0%
um multinational fraud Rings criminal
 
04:55:41.930 --> 04:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
organizations that were using stolen
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
identities not information they stole
 
04:55:46.368 --> 04:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
from Employment Security but they stole
 
04:55:48.530 --> 04:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
through other means and then using it to
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
try to leverage and gain the
 
04:55:53.570 --> 04:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
um the additional benefits that were
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
available during the pandemic there were
 
04:55:59.208 --> 04:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars paid out
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
nationally might even I haven't been
 
04:56:04.570 --> 04:56:04.580 align:start position:0%
able to see a good solid number on that
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
but some states had a tremendous amount
 
04:56:11.690 --> 04:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
of ID theft related fraud and their
 
04:56:14.050 --> 04:56:14.060 align:start position:0%
trust funds suffered as a result of that
 
04:56:16.090 --> 04:56:16.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
we had about five hundred thousand
 
04:56:21.530 --> 04:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in ID theft related fraud
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
payments out of the two billion dollars
 
04:56:27.288 --> 04:56:27.298 align:start position:0%
that we paid out
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so most of that was in the the
 
04:56:32.750 --> 04:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
federal programs we were administering
 
04:56:34.128 --> 04:56:34.138 align:start position:0%
those Federal programs and there was
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
about another 600 a week in benefits
 
04:56:38.810 --> 04:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
being paid out so you can add up those
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh those amounts can add up very quickly
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire was was I would say
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
more successful than any other state in
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
detecting it prior to payment simply
 
04:56:51.948 --> 04:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
because we went back to basics
 
04:56:54.050 --> 04:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and we were we were scrupulously
 
04:56:55.850 --> 04:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
analyzing each and every claim that came
 
04:56:58.128 --> 04:56:58.138 align:start position:0%
through because we knew what the we knew
 
04:57:00.170 --> 04:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
what the identity theft related markers
 
04:57:02.448 --> 04:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
were it was just a matter of finding
 
04:57:05.150 --> 04:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
them before payments issued tried to do
 
04:57:06.730 --> 04:57:06.740 align:start position:0%
that with as little impact on
 
04:57:10.250 --> 04:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
individuals that were rightfully filing
 
04:57:12.590 --> 04:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
and needed those benefits to try not to
 
04:57:14.150 --> 04:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
hold them up
 
04:57:16.250 --> 04:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
um with the the criminals
 
04:57:19.730 --> 04:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
um but it was just the the the staff
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
within that Fraud Unit looking at those
 
04:57:24.590 --> 04:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
claims and shutting down those claims
 
04:57:26.330 --> 04:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
before they paid and they were very very
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
very successful at that so you're gonna
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot with
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
hearings before Congress recently on the
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
the pandemic related fraud particularly
 
04:57:37.970 --> 04:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
with the unemployment program but I
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire could be held out as
 
04:57:41.448 --> 04:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
an example of of how to properly
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
Safeguard trust fund dollars
 
04:57:47.090 --> 04:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
um to really analyze those claims and to
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
be smart about
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
um how you're reviewing them prior to
 
04:57:54.410 --> 04:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
payment because we were quite successful
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:01.368 --> 04:58:01.378 align:start position:0%
just a couple of quick questions you
 
04:58:03.050 --> 04:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
have a significant amount of money in
 
04:58:04.970 --> 04:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
the trust fund are you allowed to
 
04:58:07.368 --> 04:58:07.378 align:start position:0%
collect interest on that as a lot of its
 
04:58:09.050 --> 04:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
federal dollars
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
so we the the trust fund earns quarterly
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
interest uh from the treasury Department
 
04:58:16.368 --> 04:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:58:18.288 --> 04:58:18.298 align:start position:0%
um it does sit with treasury
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
um we have local accounts through which
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
we we draw funds from the uh account
 
04:58:26.690 --> 04:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
that sits with the treasury we draw down
 
04:58:28.810 --> 04:58:28.820 align:start position:0%
those funds to pay benefits we then
 
04:58:31.368 --> 04:58:31.378 align:start position:0%
receive those tax payments and they go
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
through our local accounts and then go
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
to credit
 
04:58:35.810 --> 04:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
um our trust fund but we do get
 
04:58:38.330 --> 04:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
quarterly interest on that fund okay
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
so what about the unemployment insurance
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
tax rate that you mentioned earlier how
 
04:58:45.890 --> 04:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
do we compare to say other states around
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
us as far as a percentage that's taken
 
04:58:51.530 --> 04:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
from the employer
 
04:58:54.650 --> 04:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
um so we compare very well against
 
04:58:56.510 --> 04:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
um the rest of the Northeast
 
04:58:58.368 --> 04:58:58.378 align:start position:0%
um we have the the lowest unemployment
 
04:59:00.850 --> 04:59:00.860 align:start position:0%
insurance tax burden in the Northeast
 
04:59:03.948 --> 04:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
and each state
 
04:59:06.890 --> 04:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
um has slight differences in their
 
04:59:09.368 --> 04:59:09.378 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance tax
 
04:59:11.810 --> 04:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
system so
 
04:59:13.430 --> 04:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you know New Hampshire has a taxable
 
04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
wage base of fourteen thousand dollars
 
04:59:17.390 --> 04:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
meaning the employer pays out their rate
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
on the first fourteen thousand in annual
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
wages to each employee other states have
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
different taxable wage bases different
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
ways of setting those experience based
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
rates but when you do an Apples to
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
Apples comparison and you look at total
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
UI taxes paid compared against total
 
04:59:38.510 --> 04:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
wages paid in each state New Hampshire
 
04:59:41.930 --> 04:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
has the lowest UI tax burden in the
 
04:59:41.940 --> 04:59:43.150 align:start position:0%
has the lowest UI tax burden in the
Northeast

04:59:43.150 --> 04:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
Northeast
 
04:59:47.570 --> 04:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
and continuing to get lower the last uh
 
04:59:51.830 --> 04:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
published comparison was prior to the
 
04:59:55.368 --> 04:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
0.5 percent reduction that went into
 
04:59:57.350 --> 04:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
effect for employers with the fourth
 
05:00:00.530 --> 05:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2022 so those rates are are
 
05:00:02.570 --> 05:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
continuing to come down
 
05:00:04.610 --> 05:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
um so that the next publication that
 
05:00:06.350 --> 05:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
will come out will have an even lower UI
 
05:00:08.090 --> 05:00:08.100 align:start position:0%
tax burden for New Hampshire employers
 
05:00:09.948 --> 05:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
compared to other states
 
05:00:11.208 --> 05:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
and then the next one that comes out
 
05:00:12.350 --> 05:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
will be even lower because we're
 
05:00:16.550 --> 05:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
anticipating that the second quarter of
 
05:00:19.670 --> 05:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
this year that will maintain a balance
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
that will allow those employers to get
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
that one percent uh tax rate reduction
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
so in very very important with those
 
05:00:28.990 --> 05:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
reductions because with each reduction
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
you're reducing the cost of hiring
 
05:00:34.970 --> 05:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
individuals so very important from uh
 
05:00:38.170 --> 05:00:38.180 align:start position:0%
from a competition standpoint with
 
05:00:40.368 --> 05:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
attracting businesses to New Hampshire
 
05:00:42.770 --> 05:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
which we've been successful in doing
 
05:00:44.570 --> 05:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
these past few years
 
05:00:46.910 --> 05:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
so you kind of started to answer my
 
05:00:49.310 --> 05:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
question so your contact with obviously
 
05:00:51.590 --> 05:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell so that's something
 
05:00:53.390 --> 05:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
when he's going out to attract business
 
05:00:56.030 --> 05:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
he can use that figure to say look we
 
05:00:58.190 --> 05:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
have this other benefit by okay great
 
05:01:00.350 --> 05:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
yeah we and and commissioner Caswell
 
05:01:00.360 --> 05:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
yeah we and and commissioner Caswell
gets

05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
gets
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
um a whole bunch of us together
 
05:01:07.368 --> 05:01:07.378 align:start position:0%
um every every month for for an update
 
05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
on what's going on with the unemployment
 
05:01:12.410 --> 05:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
insurance system both on the tax side
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
and the benefit side uh what we're
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
seeing in in the on the on the economic
 
05:01:19.310 --> 05:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
and labor market information side as
 
05:01:22.190 --> 05:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
well Brian gotlab is our director of
 
05:01:27.530 --> 05:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
almie um Brian is uh uh quite the uh
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
data monster I guess you can look at him
 
05:01:33.650 --> 05:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
he's just a data junkie and Brian
 
05:01:35.510 --> 05:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
participates in those meetings but we we
 
05:01:35.520 --> 05:01:36.430 align:start position:0%
participates in those meetings but we we
talk

05:01:36.430 --> 05:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
talk
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
quite regularly with commissioner
 
05:01:41.350 --> 05:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
Caswell and his team thanks uh
 
05:01:44.570 --> 05:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative hatch represent Maguire
 
05:01:47.868 --> 05:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
there did I see you yeah
 
05:01:50.810 --> 05:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
so back to the fraud question uh do you
 
05:01:54.288 --> 05:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
ever mail benefit checks out of state
 
05:01:57.050 --> 05:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
yes we do okay why
 
05:01:57.060 --> 05:01:59.810 align:start position:0%
yes we do okay why
so

05:01:59.810 --> 05:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
um about 85 of individuals uh right now
 
05:02:08.270 --> 05:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
elect to have their benefit payments
 
05:02:10.550 --> 05:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
direct deposited into their account we
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
have about 15 percent
 
05:02:15.110 --> 05:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
um within a few percentage points of
 
05:02:17.470 --> 05:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
that that elect to have paper checks
 
05:02:22.250 --> 05:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
issued to them but so in order to be
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment benefits in
 
05:02:25.850 --> 05:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you need to have worked in
 
05:02:28.670 --> 05:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then had a qualifying
 
05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
separation from a New Hampshire employer
 
05:02:33.170 --> 05:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
so you could be a Massachusetts resident
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
of Vermont or Maine
 
05:02:38.650 --> 05:02:38.660 align:start position:0%
and likewise New Hampshire residents
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
could be filing claims against
 
05:02:43.368 --> 05:02:43.378 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because they work in
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so it's the state for in
 
05:02:47.570 --> 05:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
which you worked that you collect
 
05:02:47.580 --> 05:02:48.470 align:start position:0%
which you worked that you collect
against

05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:02:50.448 --> 05:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
think that nobody would want to live
 
05:02:53.930 --> 05:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
anywhere else yeah I don't understand so
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
so these people with fraud that from
 
05:02:58.490 --> 05:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
other countries they're doing direct
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
deposit is that it they're
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
well they they weren't you need to be in
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
the contiguous U.S
 
05:03:08.448 --> 05:03:08.458 align:start position:0%
um or Canada in order to be filing uh
 
05:03:11.330 --> 05:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
for benefits and what was what was going
 
05:03:14.690 --> 05:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
on with the the
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh ID theft related fraud was they would
 
05:03:19.730 --> 05:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
they would have your name they would
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
have your social they probably had your
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
address they probably had your work
 
05:03:23.040 --> 05:03:24.470 align:start position:0%
address they probably had your work
history

05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
history
 
05:03:26.270 --> 05:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
um but they were going to put a
 
05:03:27.770 --> 05:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
different email down because they didn't
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
want the emails going to you
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and they were going to have a
 
05:03:34.128 --> 05:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
different bank account and they wanted
 
05:03:36.050 --> 05:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
to make sure to aggregate those bank
 
05:03:37.970 --> 05:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
accounts so they weren't having to go to
 
05:03:40.128 --> 05:03:40.138 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of different banks and
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
they wanted those banks that were a bank
 
05:03:46.610 --> 05:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
in name only and and kind of functioned
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
under the the banking uh regulatory
 
05:03:51.530 --> 05:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
system kind of
 
05:03:57.128 --> 05:03:57.138 align:start position:0%
um oversight and so you had patterns of
 
05:04:00.970 --> 05:04:00.980 align:start position:0%
how the the the organizations
 
05:04:04.250 --> 05:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
fraudulently using a identities
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
what they were doing for emails what
 
05:04:09.770 --> 05:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
they were doing for for banks and the
 
05:04:13.250 --> 05:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
trick was just staying ahead of of what
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
they were doing detecting it quickly
 
05:04:17.208 --> 05:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
seeing those patterns and freezing those
 
05:04:21.410 --> 05:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
those payments before they issued and
 
05:04:21.420 --> 05:04:22.368 align:start position:0%
those payments before they issued and
um

05:04:22.368 --> 05:04:22.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:24.770 --> 05:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
like like was mentioned before and
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
you'll hear more about if the
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
Congressional hearings continue There
 
05:04:29.930 --> 05:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
were some of our larger States that had
 
05:04:33.050 --> 05:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars go out
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
before they realized that it was a
 
05:04:37.850 --> 05:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
problem that how many benefit checks
 
05:04:40.368 --> 05:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
they were sending to this this same bank
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
account or to these fictitious email
 
05:04:45.050 --> 05:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
addresses okay
 
05:04:48.110 --> 05:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
right unrelated question so the um the
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
Fourteen thousand dollar maximum that
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
people pay on how long has that been in
 
05:04:52.320 --> 05:04:53.448 align:start position:0%
people pay on how long has that been in
place

05:04:53.448 --> 05:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh 2009
 
05:04:56.160 --> 05:04:57.490 align:start position:0%
uh 2009
um

05:04:57.490 --> 05:04:57.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:01.490 --> 05:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
2009 there was a major reform in
 
05:05:04.250 --> 05:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
response to the the Great Recession at
 
05:05:07.850 --> 05:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
the time uh there were uh the taxable
 
05:05:09.890 --> 05:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
wage base was increased from eight
 
05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they did that in a
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
graduated staggered way so it went first
 
05:05:17.390 --> 05:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
to ten thousand following year to twelve
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
thousand the following year to 14 which
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
is where it has stayed so I think it hit
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
it got to 14
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
000 in 2012 is either 11 or 12 and it
 
05:05:30.050 --> 05:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
stayed at that amount since that time
 
05:05:31.610 --> 05:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
there are also other measures that got
 
05:05:34.010 --> 05:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
put in place with that reform
 
05:05:37.788 --> 05:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
um they created a a third table of tax
 
05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
rates with that reform that were for
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
your more chronic negative rated
 
05:05:44.090 --> 05:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
employers those employers that have
 
05:05:46.010 --> 05:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
through seasonal patterns have large
 
05:05:48.288 --> 05:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
layoff activity each year that were
 
05:05:51.170 --> 05:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
overusing the unemployment program over
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
overusing compared to what they were
 
05:05:52.798 --> 05:05:54.288 align:start position:0%
overusing compared to what they were
contributing

05:05:54.288 --> 05:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
05:05:57.770 --> 05:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
um so they they now as of that reform at
 
05:06:01.250 --> 05:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
higher rates and individuals had a
 
05:06:03.770 --> 05:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
waiting week implemented so prior to
 
05:06:05.930 --> 05:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
that reform individuals did not have a
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
one-week waiting week as of that and
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
continuing to today individuals have a
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
waiting week for the first week of
 
05:06:15.410 --> 05:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
Eligibility that they don't receive
 
05:06:18.288 --> 05:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
benefits that was that waiting week was
 
05:06:20.570 --> 05:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
waived during the pandemic but was put
 
05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
back in in May of 21.
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
so if 427 is the normal Max that extra
 
05:06:31.570 --> 05:06:31.580 align:start position:0%
six hundred dollars was a huge
 
05:06:34.610 --> 05:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
incentive not to work yes and did the
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
feds also add things about
 
05:06:39.650 --> 05:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
taking away this you're looking for work
 
05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
and some of that those are the kinds of
 
05:06:43.368 --> 05:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
requirements is
 
05:06:47.330 --> 05:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
um so they they expanded eligibility
 
05:06:50.650 --> 05:06:50.660 align:start position:0%
um with in terms of uh gig workers
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
self-employed traditionally
 
05:06:54.890 --> 05:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
um it's only people in covered
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
employment so W-2 employment that are
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment benefits the
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
federal programs expanded that
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility they expanded that
 
05:07:04.610 --> 05:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
eligibility to also include those that
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough earnings in their
 
05:07:08.810 --> 05:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
base period to ordinarily qualify for
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so it was a much
 
05:07:14.448 --> 05:07:14.458 align:start position:0%
larger group of people that was eligible
 
05:07:18.530 --> 05:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
you had the additional 600 that went on
 
05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
top of your 427 or whatever your weekly
 
05:07:24.730 --> 05:07:24.740 align:start position:0%
benefit amount was that went from
 
05:07:28.850 --> 05:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
April of 2020 through July of 2020 and
 
05:07:30.890 --> 05:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
then there was a brief Hiatus to that
 
05:07:33.650 --> 05:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
through a then uh Congress and the
 
05:07:36.110 --> 05:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
President Clinton see eye to eye then
 
05:07:37.730 --> 05:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
they came back with the additional three
 
05:07:40.868 --> 05:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars that got added
 
05:07:44.330 --> 05:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
following following after that so there
 
05:07:45.770 --> 05:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
was a lot that was done to expand
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
eligibility to expand the amount of
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
benefits that that individuals were
 
05:07:52.850 --> 05:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
receiving all of that
 
05:07:56.750 --> 05:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
um came to an end in June of 21 in New
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire some states some states went
 
05:08:02.448 --> 05:08:02.458 align:start position:0%
to the end of the programs ended in the
 
05:08:05.690 --> 05:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
federal program deadline was September
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
of 21 New Hampshire exited those
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
programs early earlier than other states
 
05:08:13.310 --> 05:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
in June of 21 as an effort to try to get
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
more people back to work because we had
 
05:08:17.830 --> 05:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
estimated through Brian gottlub's
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
analysis that about 70 percent of
 
05:08:22.010 --> 05:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
individuals filing for unemployment
 
05:08:24.708 --> 05:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
benefits When they were paying out the
