second meeting to discuss bills that
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
have been forwarded to us by our friends
 
00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the wall as it's
 
00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:02.030 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the wall as it's
called

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
we will be discussing four bills here
 
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
this morning Senate Bill 113 relative to
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness review of The Joint
 
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
utility Energy Efficiency plan we'll
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
follow that with Senate Bill 161
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
relative to low moderate income
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects then we'll move
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
on to Senate Bill 166 relative to
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
electric grid modernization
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
and wrap it up after that with Senate
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 167 relative to Green hydrogen
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
energy and infrastructure so let's get
 
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
started with Senate bill 113.
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
and even though I do not have a pink
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
card from him I'm going to assume that
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
senator abard from
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
District 12 will introduce this bill to
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
US senator avard thank you Mr chairman
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
and yes I will be introducing it seeing
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
how I am the Prime on this and uh well
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Senator Kevin abar from
 
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
District 12.
 
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
greetings to you all nice to see you all
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
smiling this morning
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
all right I trust you all had a
 
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:07.019 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh Easter
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
again I I am the prime sponsor for uh
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
sb113 um
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh last year the legislator legislature
 
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
acted quickly to correct the uh is that
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
too loud uh to quickly correct an order
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
from the puc which severely restricted
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves Energy
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
Efficiency program and it jeopardize
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
many of the contractors who worked for
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
HB 549 restored the funding for the New
 
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire safes program and provided
 
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.949 align:start position:0%
Hampshire safes program and provided
clarity

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
on administrative Administration going
 
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.630 align:start position:0%
on administrative Administration going
forward

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
contained in HB 549 was a provision that
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
required the program's planned electric
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
savings to be at least 65 percent of the
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
overall savings the puc interpreted this
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
change to apply to a planned Lifetime
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
and annual Savings of the program not
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
just the planned annual savings every
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
party in the puc docket testified in
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
support of applying the legislative
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
change to annual savings
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
and while the statute does not
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
specifically uh specify whether the
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
annual or lifetime savings should be
 
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
used the puc interpretation
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
interpretation differed from every
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
single party to the docket and limits to
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State program's
 
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness which reduces uh benefits
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
to customers and negatively impacts home
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
builders remodelers who perform the work
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
because of the savings from the
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
weatherization improvements last uh
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
because of the savings from
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
weatherization improvements last for at
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
least decades rather than just years and
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to balance the percentage
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
of the lifetime electric savings at 65
 
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.490 align:start position:0%
of the lifetime electric savings at 65
percent

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
and whether whetherisation is important
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
tool to help customers manage their
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
energy costs and improve the comfort and
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
value of their homes
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
through the homes performance with
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
energy star programs customers receive
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive audits of their homes and
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
rebates to reduce the cost of
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
recommended building improvements like
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
insulation and ceiling air spaces in
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
many of the rebates making home more
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
comfortable and less drafty which
 
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:19.700 align:start position:0%
results also in lower energy uses
 
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959 align:start position:0%
weatherization improvements result in
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
savings for customers and overall energy
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
use and the New Hampshire safe programs
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
are the only source of State supported
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
customer for customers to increase
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency in their home and the vast
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
majority of the cities and towns across
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
the state utilize the HW hpes programs
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
the pdc's interpretation of the
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
legislation changed last year puts this
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
state support for weatherization at risk
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
which diminishes the value of the
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
programs to the customers and again it
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes the same contractors that
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
were intended to be protected under HB
 
00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:58.009 align:start position:0%
were intended to be protected under HB
549

00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
549
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
the provisions added to HB 549 and puc's
 
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
interpretations changed how the programs
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
have been administered in the past
 
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
adding annual to the savings
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
requirements would restore these
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
programs enable the contractors to
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
continue to meet customers expectations
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
the weatherization programs offered
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire saves supports
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
good paying local construction jobs and
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
helps electric customers control their
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
overall energy spending in particular
 
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
the importance in the face of the
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
current High inflation and elevated
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
Energy prices we all know that that's
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
happening right now
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
without these weatherization programs
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
customers would pay even higher energy
 
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
bills and those who cannot afford to pay
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
these bills would need to seek
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
additional state and local assistance
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
this will strain New Hampshire's
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
low-income energy assisted programs
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
putting pressure on the state and local
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
budgets and result in increase in a
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
number of unpaid bills which could be
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
borne by
 
00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:05.990 align:start position:0%
borne by
taxpayers

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at some of the uh at our
 
00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339 align:start position:0%
committee reports there was no nobody
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
that came in to oppose this bill
 
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.129 align:start position:0%
that came in to oppose this bill
and

00:14:15.129 --> 00:14:15.139 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
the department of energy was neutral on
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
it and basically it's just a simple
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
language fix
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
and I I believe to increase I don't know
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
if he's here or not but with the
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate he he also came in in
 
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
support of it
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
um Matt Mayberry here's as well he's the
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
vice president of the New Hampshire Home
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
Builders Association and he also is
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
here to support it as well
 
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.350 align:start position:0%
here to support it as well
uh

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
to simple fix we're just asking you to
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
to vote with us and uh
 
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator good introduction
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
um we I'm sure have a few questions but
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
before we do that I would just remind
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
you that we do need a pink card for our
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
record-keeping purposes when you want me
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
to write a pin card yes okay we can do
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
and I have one quick question before I
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
turn it over to representative McGee was
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
this bill amended by the senate or is
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing here the bill as
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
introduced it's as introduced by me as
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
introduced okay great thank you
 
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
um the rep representative of Oz or
 
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose and I both serve on the
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
easy board and we heard about this in
 
00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
the easy board from the utilities
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
specifically because they said their
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
attorneys were unable to figure out how
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
to interpret
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
the interpretation so that they could
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
Implement so uh can you just comment on
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
how it looks like it's a one-word fix
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
right it's to clarify that annual
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
savings is what we're looking for so
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
that it can't be interpreted in any
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
other way is that that is correct yeah
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's it's a simple fix and just
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh I guess you know belts and suspenders
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
is what what it's needed and uh and this
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
is I think it's an important program
 
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
additional questions from the committee
 
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has one thank you
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you senator abard
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
when I think about the lifetime savings
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
that's over a number of years correct
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
right over decades or decades so
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
if the annual Energy savings are below
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
65 percent each year that implies that
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
the lifetime savings are under 65
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
percent as well do I have that right I
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
don't believe so I think the cumulative
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
effect is what you'll see the savings
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
over over a decade Decades of period but
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
I think there's some people that can
 
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more specific about
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
the percentage better than I can
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
actually okay yeah but thank you for the
 
00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:03.230 align:start position:0%
actually okay yeah but thank you for the
question

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
in in this bill it says that you're
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
using the granite state test does that
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
um can you point me to where that exists
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
I cannot okay all right all right fair
 
00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:21.409 align:start position:0%
I cannot okay all right all right fair
enough

00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
um but it's a standard that's used yeah
 
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
I believe so okay yeah all right thank
 
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.049 align:start position:0%
I believe so okay yeah all right thank
you

00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%

the record Griffin Roberge from the New
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy the
 
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
department is neutral to sent Bill 113
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
as introduced as this committee is aware
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
the puc issued in order back in November
 
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:21.260 align:start position:0%
of 2021 that's order 26.
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
553 that significantly altered the
 
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:26.660 align:start position:0%
funding levels for the
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
2021-2023 triennial Energy Efficiency

2021-2023 triennial Energy Efficiency
plan

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
that plan sought to establish new
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
funding levels for programmatic outlines
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
for ratepayer fund and Energy Efficiency
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
programs in the state these programs
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
which are operated jointly amongst New
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Electric utilities known as
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves offer a suite of
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
different Financial incentives and
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%

properties

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
properties
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
in response to this order the New
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire General Court passed and
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
Governor soon who signed into law House
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 549 from last year that bill
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
restored programmatic stability to these
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves programs but most
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
importantly House Bill 549 represented a
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
clear demonstration by this legislature
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
of its policy-making Authority and
 
00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
setting the system benefits charge which
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
is the charge that all electric
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
customers pay to fund Energy Efficiency
 
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
programs and in setting in statute
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
certain elements that the puc must use
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
when it evaluates these Energy
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs including the cost
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness standards to evaluate
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
program savings which is the Genesis of
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 113 here today
 
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.850 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 113 here today
um

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
following House Bill 549's passage the
 
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
puc issued another order that's order
 
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.430 align:start position:0%
puc issued another order that's order
26.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
26.
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
621 in April of last year that approved
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
the 2022 to 2023 Statewide Energy
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
Efficiency plan the puc made interpret
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
made an interpretation of House Bill
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
549's language on the cost Effectiveness
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
that will have impacts on New Hampshire
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
saves program offerings in the future
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
and again that's the purpose of Senate
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
Bill 113 here today is to provide that
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
legislative Clarity on that cost
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness language if you look at
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
the bill obviously it's very it's a very
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
small change but on lines 10 to 12 of
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
the bill the legislature required quote
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
in no instance shall an electric
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
utilities planned Electric System
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
savings fall below 65 percent of its
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
overall plan Energy savings in the puc's
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
April order again that's 26 621 the puc
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted the statutory language to
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
require that all electric utility
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
program offerings must quote meet the
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
requisite electric energy savings
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
threshold of 65 percent in both annual
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
electric energy savings and lifetime
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
electric energy saving categories in the
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
2024 uh to 2026 triennial plan
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
so utilities per House Bill 549 are
 
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:12.140 align:start position:0%
required to submit their
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
2024-2026 trial triennial Energy
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
Efficiency plans to the puc by July 1 of
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
this year so what does that mean
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
um the general court obviously required
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
on lines 10 to 12 and House Bill 549
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
they required a balance between electric
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
savings and overall Energy savings
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
whereby 65 percent of the overall Energy
 
00:21:39.169 --> 00:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
savings must be electric savings this
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
provision codified a long-standing puc
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
imposed threshold for Energy Efficiency
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
programs offered by the electric
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
utilities in the state in past years
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
this threshold has been reviewed using
 
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
annual electric and Energy savings
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
meaning that for a three-year plan such
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
as 21 to 23 the electric Savings in 21.
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 would make up more would make
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
up 65 or more of all Energy savings in
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
all three of those years in other words
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
the 65 percent threshold was reviewed by
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
examining annual plan savings
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
the puc when an interpreted House Bill
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
549 and its April order inserted the
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
concept of Lifetime savings into the
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
evaluation of this threshold this means
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
that measures that have uh and this
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
means Energy Efficiency measures that
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
have a longer useful lifespan will count
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
more when evaluating whether the 65
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
threshold has been met for example
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
whether a residential weatherization
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
efforts you tend to have a longer useful
 
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
life and have a higher percentage of
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
non-electric savings than other purely
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
electric folks focused offerings like
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
High Energy Efficiency lighting fixtures
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
by measuring both Lifetime and annual
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
Savings of an improvement energy
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
conservations that have a longer
 
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
lifetime like insulation and other
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
weatherization efforts May drag down the
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
overall portfolio's ability to achieve
 
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
that 65 percent savings threshold in
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
other terms longer term life-lived
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
programs like weatherization and
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
insulation they achieve non-electric
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
savings may need to be reduced in New
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire safe's future future
 
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
portfolios so that New Hampshire saves
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
can achieve that 65 threshold and will
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
likely gain puc approval when the
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
utilities file on July 1.
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
um simply this would really negatively
 
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
impact residential weatherization
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
programs like the home energy assistance
 
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:39.419 align:start position:0%
program that's offered by New Hampshire
 
00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:40.970 align:start position:0%
program that's offered by New Hampshire
saves

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
saves
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
um samp Bill 113 uh clarifies that
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
legislative intent by requiring that the
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
65 threshold applies to plan annual
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
Energy savings by doing so
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs will likely
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
remain in a portfolio that achieves that
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
65 balance as has been done for many
 
00:23:59.169 --> 00:23:59.179 align:start position:0%
years in the puc
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
I've gone on for quite a bit I'm done
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate your testimony
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure representative Corman wants
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
to follow up to understand why
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
if the legislature if anything done in
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
the legislature only applies to the
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
Future not the past
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
then if a utility is achieving 65
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
electric Savings in each annual
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
increment going forward how can that not
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
result in a 65 Lifetime Achievement so
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I I would
 
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
submit that
 
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:37.820 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
puc's interpretation in its April order
 
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
um certainly doesn't preclude obviously
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh different types of programs uh being
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
offered by the electric utilities the
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
concern is that that 65 threshold when
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
applied to both annual and lifetime
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
savings could detrimentally impact
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.470 align:start position:0%
savings could detrimentally impact
um

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say non-electric Energy
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs like weatherization
 
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
efforts offered like I said to the home
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
energy assistance program
 
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:08.990 align:start position:0%
energy assistance program
um

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm sure the utilities might
 
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299 align:start position:0%
be able to offer a program that meets
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
the new puc imposed thresholds but it
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
would detrimentally impact many of their
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
program offerings that look at
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
weatherization efforts and Residential
 
00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:23.710 align:start position:0%
weatherization efforts and Residential
Properties

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
Properties
 
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.750 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
question

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
my question so
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
um I apologize if I feel like I'm a
 
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
little bit thick-headed and what you're
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
really saying but
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
is that mean to imply that for the
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-electric savings are you implying
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
that over the years
 
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.130 align:start position:0%
that over the years
that

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
efficiency because of the age of of of
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
the project the defense sheet would go
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
down over the years enough to wear over
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
a lifetime it wouldn't meet the 65
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
savings on the average because as you go
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
farther like say 10 20 years down the
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
line whatever weather weatherization you
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
may have done to your house may have an
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
exponential lesser effect over the years
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
because of age of the product or
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
whatever I'm trying to find out no
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
that's fine so I I thank you for the
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
question I think the uh best way to
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
clarify it is that the puc is now
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
requiring that those savings to achieve
 
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
that 65 threshold you're measuring on
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
annual basis and a lifetime basis now
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
whereas in previous years it tends to be
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
just annual the puc when issued its
 
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
April order interpreted again Lifetime
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
and annual because weatherization
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
efforts you know like insulation that
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
type of thing tend to have a longer
 
00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:51.500 align:start position:0%
useful life than say
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency lighting which may
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
last maybe you know
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
broadly maybe five to seven years for
 
00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:00.059 align:start position:0%
lighting but weatherization efforts
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
might last you know a couple decades
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
that could reduce the ability to meet
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
that lifetime that 65 percent Lifetime
 
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
and annual thresholds that the puc
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
create by reconverting it and clarifying
 
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
that it's annual savings you would allow
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
those programs to remain in utilities
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions from the
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
committee representative Munn says one
 
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.529 align:start position:0%
being here
um

00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
I I along with representative Doug
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
Thomas have struggled with this a little
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
bit and
 
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
um is it
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that the puc's
 
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation increases the the
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
increases the the denominator in the in
 
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
the equation that needs to be done the
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
the the the the it's the overall savings
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
from weatherization if you do it over a
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
lifetime that increases the total amount
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
of savings so that when you compare that
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
to the annual the elective savings
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
you're getting from Electric it's going
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
to depress the uh the the calculation
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay thank you
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
um I've worked in this sector for 25
 
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.230 align:start position:0%
um I've worked in this sector for 25
years

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
I appreciate representative mun's
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
question because the nature of my
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:37.940 align:start position:0%
was going to be something like no
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
agree that
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
people who aren't deeply familiar with
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
the way these programs are
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
operated and evaluated to understand
 
00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.289 align:start position:0%
operated and evaluated to understand
this

00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
debate without actually seeing the like
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
the the equations
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
that that are and and some actual
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
figures that are being used
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
um you know we've got a distinction here
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
that electric savings must be 65 percent
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
of overall savings so the other savings
 
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking about are heating savings
 
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.590 align:start position:0%
we're talking about are heating savings
right

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
heating versus electric use and part of
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
this controversy if there's a
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
controversy or a policy disagreement is
 
00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
controversy or a policy disagreement is
that

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
the system benefits charges levied only
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
on electric bills
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have that's why this
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
requirement gets in there from a policy
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint well we have to make sure
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
that electric savings are the majority
 
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%
of the savings as opposed to all savings
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
um it's just it I mean it's a really
 
00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:55.010 align:start position:0%
um it's just it I mean it's a really
difficult

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
you're nodding so I'm like getting that
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
you kind of agree that it's just a
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
really something it's hard for people to
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
wrap their heads around you know what
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
what are we even talking about here 65
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
of of versus annual and Lifetime and you
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
know representative months say what is
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
the denominator right yeah no and I I
 
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I would
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
submit yes it is it is uh I would submit
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
holistically energy policy is not the
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
easiest policy to comprehend
 
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.590 align:start position:0%
easiest policy to comprehend
um

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
I I you know but I I would go back to
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that the legislature you know
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
decided to exercise its policy making
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
authority to uh address an earlier puc
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
order made in November of 2021
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
um to issue definitive guidance to the
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission as to how
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
um they review these plans when they're
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
submitted every three years
 
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
um you know in other words we went down
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
the rabbit hole Yeah
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
um that is one argument one could make
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
um but you know I these you know I would
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
submit the legislature clearly imposed
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
its its its policy making authority to
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
give the puc that that that Clarity
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
obviously the puc in its November no
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
April order I'm sorry last year
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
um interpret it a certain way this is uh
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 113 represents another
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
effort by the legislature to further
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
clarify that legislative right thank you
 
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
McGee has one thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Roberts for taking my
 
00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:27.289 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Roberts for taking my
question

00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
um I have heard in testimony here that
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
um the weatherization programs give a
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of benefit and
 
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
um the electric savings programs in many
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
cases have been built out in terms of
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
people taking advantage of some of those
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering whether you could
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.310 align:start position:0%
speak to
um

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
any effects there might be on that
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
non-65 right so we're limiting the
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
ability to do more weatherization
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
because we have a cap on how much of
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
that SBC that can be can be used towards
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
weatherization and I wonder if there's
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
any data on the benefits of the
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
weatherization in terms of how much
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
demand we're offsetting that kind of
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
thing do we do we have any analysis of
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
the benefits that we're actually gaining
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
back for people sure sure by doing the
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
non-electric yeah no that's fine thank
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
you for the question I think I'd respect
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are many others behind me
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
who are more involved in that field
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
um specifically the utilities who I'm
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
sure have read the readily accessible
 
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
data on that I think that'd be a better
 
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
question than maybe ask them here today
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
um but yes I would I would submit that
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know the way the POC has interpreted
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
it it will require the utilities to
 
00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
amend their program offerings at the
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
detriment of of their weatherization
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
programs and again a lot of these
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs tend to benefit
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
those at the lower end of the economic
 
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
ladder those of low-income or moderate
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
means so and follow-up follow up so in
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
that case if it is the lower end of
 
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
income ladder than we would be
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
lowering their bills if we were able to
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
do more weatherization yes and you know
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
obviously the department offers its
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program or WAP
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
we use the federal dollars
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes the department and some in
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
many different programs will often
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
collaborate or collaborate with New
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves and their program
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
offerings to kind of
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
cover the remaining elements of a given
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
project and that type of thing because
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
you know weatherization assistance
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
programs dollars have Federal strings
 
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
that we can only go up to a certain
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
point with our dollars and then New
 
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves can maybe come in and
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
cover the Tail land of a project okay
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
um this this bill seems like a a
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
clarification bill um to make to make
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
things a lot stronger um just wondering
 
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
why your department is neutral and not
 
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
supportive of it sure so I I thank you
 
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:57.620 align:start position:0%
for the question I think the department
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
is taking a neutral stance in that
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
because the legislature again
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh not to steal what representative
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
Reynolds meant before but jumped into
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
the rabbit hole and decided to exercise
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
its policy making Authority last year
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
regarding the system benefits charge and
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
how the puc should be reviewing
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
um these plans we defer to the
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
legislature in making that policy call
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
obviously providing input on what the
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
impacts from their policy choices would
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
be but again deferring to the
 
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions from the
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee I want to thank you for being
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
here to testify this morning next I'll
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
call on Mr Matt Mayberry who's here to
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Home
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
Builders Association
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
there we go good morning chairman good
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
morning committee members my name is

Builders Association
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
I represent the 36 000 men and women who
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
I encourage you please support
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
113 and this one word change that one
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
word makes a good effective program much
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
more efficient and reaches out to more
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
of our friends and neighbors here in New
 
00:35:29.099 --> 00:35:31.450 align:start position:0%
of our friends and neighbors here in New
Hampshire

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:31.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
5860 New Hampshire families relied on
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
this program to stay in their homes
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
if programs like this weren't available
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
they would be going to your towns your
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
cities your Boris Luckman and asking for
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
help to stay in their homes
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
it's the only way it works
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
so we're asking for this one word change
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
please because again it makes a good
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
effective program more efficient and
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
reach more New Hampshire families
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
easiest testimony you're going to have
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you my pleasure chairman questions
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll thank you and we'll
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
move on perfect testimony then it was
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
perfect estimated thank you committee
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
members have a good day
 
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:27.260 align:start position:0%
next we'll call on eversource
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
represented by Michael Licata and Mark
 
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.190 align:start position:0%
represented by Michael Licata and Mark
leminger

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Michael licato
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
representing eversource with me today is
 
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
Mark Le manager Mark is the senior
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
analyst for Regulatory and planning at
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
eversource and Mark helps put together
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
the triennial plan so he really is a
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert on how we manage
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
and administer the Energy Efficiency
 
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.650 align:start position:0%
and administer the Energy Efficiency
programs

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.250 align:start position:0%
programs
um

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
I had
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
things to say but uh Mr robarge and
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
Senator avard really covered the
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
majority of them I was going to talk
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
about the the house bill last year that
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
provide some clarification and rectify
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that were created as
 
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:24.380 align:start position:0%
part of puc order
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
26553 but again that was covered so I
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
think I'll really
 
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.230 align:start position:0%
think I'll really
um

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
Focus uh my testimony and then obviously
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
open it up for for questions which Mark
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
will answer uh on on representative
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
corman's question
 
00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:41.579 align:start position:0%
um around
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
why this is problematic to apply this
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
new requirement of 65 electric savings
 
00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
on a lifetime basis and it's a very
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
reasonable logical question of if you're
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
hitting that every year 65 over the
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
lifetime why wouldn't uh why wouldn't it
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
balance out and it simply
 
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
um you know just to boil it down in
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
simplest terms and I think this was a
 
00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
little bit covered before but just to
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
clarify it really does have to do with
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
the life of the
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
um uh project getting installed so if
 
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:18.140 align:start position:0%
you imagine
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
insulating a wall what is the life of
 
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
that insulation in that wall could be 20
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
30 even even longer and so you assume in
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
the modeling and in the plan the
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
lifetime savings which can be quite
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
large and those are largely thermal
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
savings now compare that to say
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
providing a rebate for a more energy
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
efficient energy star refrigerator or a
 
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:51.500 align:start position:0%
washing machine the the life of that
 
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
installation might be say five seven
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
years and so when you have those those
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
different lifetimes of the different
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
programs all of the savings that you're
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
going to accumulate from the uh the
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
insulation in the wall that occur after
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
the washing machine or the refrigerator
 
00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
breaks down and needs to get replaced
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
sort of wash out the electric saving so
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
it really has to do with the length of
 
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
the life of the thermal program the
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
thermal installations because they are
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
so long so it's easy so we we can
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
balance on an annual basis because each
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
year you're sort of comparing Apples to
 
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
Apples that year so it really does
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
become a challenge for the utilities to
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
try to to balance that out and even with
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
that lifetime savings we can get pretty
 
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
close because uh we're able to
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know try to to mix uh commercial
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
and Industrial which tend to have more
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
electric savings think of electric Drive
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
Motors that use a lot of electricity and
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
we can balance that with the residential
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
savings which tend to be more more
 
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.250 align:start position:0%
savings which tend to be more more
thermal

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
thermal
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
other utilities have a greater and I
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
believe you'll hear from the Electric
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
Co-op a greater number of residential
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
customers so it becomes exceedingly
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
difficult so it really does become a
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
challenge based upon Lifetime and adding
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
this this one simple
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh word to the statute would really
 
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:27.740 align:start position:0%
provide a great deal of clarification
 
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
and allow as Mr Mayberry said good
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
programs to work even better going
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
forward and with that I'd be happy to
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
answer well actually Mark's going to be
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you may
 
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.250 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you may
have

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much representative
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question thank you Mr
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr locata so I
 
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
believe I understand your explanation
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
but let me just make sure so let's say I
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
insulate a wall and that's gonna last
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
for 30 40 years and I get an energy star
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
appliance that lasts for seven years
 
00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:05.099 align:start position:0%
so for those first seven years it's very
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
possible that
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
the savings uh the electric savings from
 
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:14.339 align:start position:0%
the appliance are at least 65 percent of
 
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:16.700 align:start position:0%
the total then the appliance goes away
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
and now
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
zero percent of the total is electric
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
because it's all due to the insulation
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
that's correct I can put numbers around
 
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579 align:start position:0%
it at least me visually seeing numbers
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
helps to explain it in theory if you had
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
just two lines one of if you saved for
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
on your electric for your refrigerator
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's very high but just uh for the
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
refrigerator example but if you save 650
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
per year
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
and then if you also save 350 mmbtus per
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
year you are meeting the 65 annual
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
requirement but if your electric savings
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
lasts for 10 years
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
and your mmbtu savings lasts for 20
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
years over the lifetime of your project
 
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
you're only going to have 6 500 kwh
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
saved but 7 000 mmbtu saved so you're
 
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
yep no problem
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
numbers help thank you representative
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:28.970 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
uh

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
at the risk of overstating uh
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Coleman's explanation
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
which was good
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
to keep it really simple in in in my
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
head can we safely say that
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
the way the current bill reads
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
kind of assumes that all savings
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
projects are equal uh and all savings
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
projects involve electric savings and
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
because of that we know that's not true
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
and it skews what what could happen to
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh downline I need to get that answered
 
00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:08.579 align:start position:0%
in my head so I can look at it that way
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
so when sorry when uh House Bill 549 was
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
passed last year
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and then the 22-23 plan docket was
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
being heard at the commission every
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
party to the docket interpreted
 
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
that bill language to mean annual it did
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
not nobody no party in that docket
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
interpreted it as annual and lifetime
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
the order however did interpret it that
 
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.109 align:start position:0%
the order however did interpret it that
way

00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
um and the rationale and the
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is all projects on a
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
portfolio basis across residential
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
commercial and our income eligible
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
programs as well you understand that
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's different opportunities and
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
different options for customers there
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
one of our most cost effective measures
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
is weatherization on the residential
 
00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:56.839 align:start position:0%
side but under the current
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
interpretation it provides the wrong
 
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
Energy savings so we need to balance
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
the types of savings we're achieving
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
along with cost Effectiveness to make
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
sure that we're delivering a return on
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
investment for customers but now also
 
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're delivering the
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
McGee has one
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question nice to see you again
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
Mr leminger since we have your expertise
 
00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
here today I had brought up a question
 
00:44:31.619 --> 00:44:33.170 align:start position:0%
here today I had brought up a question
earlier

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
um that we had heard testimony in Prior
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
hearings about
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
um the 65 and I'm curious whether
 
00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
um you can illuminate for us uh whether
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
that is in any way problematic in terms
 
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
of the Energy Efficiency projects that
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
you undertake because I think the intent
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
by this body was to make sure that
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
electric rate payers were paying a
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
majority of the system benefits charged
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
towards electric savings but as those
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
diminish does it become harder to find
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
projects that meet the criteria I just
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
want to understand
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
for a ballpark for eversources customer
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
base we have approximately 10 to 15
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
percent of our customers heat with
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
electricity at the moment okay we've
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
largely addressed those customers over
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
the years meaning the pool of customers
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
for weatherization work tends to be
 
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.069 align:start position:0%
for weatherization work tends to be
predominantly

00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
predominantly
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
non-electric heating customers so if
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
they are to undertake weatherization
 
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.050 align:start position:0%
they are to undertake weatherization
work

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
under the current interpretation it's
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
providing the wrong
 
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.750 align:start position:0%
providing the wrong
savings

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
savings
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
um that we're looking for so it becomes
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
almost counter-intuitive
 
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:46.730 align:start position:0%
almost counter-intuitive
um

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
where you need to disincentivize
 
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
helping customers that
 
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
have the wrong type of heat right
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question following up on on
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
that and and perhaps taking us down a
 
00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:08.780 align:start position:0%
rat hole that we don't want to go down
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
is there anything magical about the 65
 
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.470 align:start position:0%
is there anything magical about the 65
percent

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
it's it's a requirement that was in the
 
00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:20.180 align:start position:0%
law the understanding that from
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
asking my legal team what the
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
interpretation could mean it's it's
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
trying to keep Reliance on the fact that
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
electric customers are paying the SBC so
 
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
therefore electric customers should be
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
benefiting and the Electric System
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
should be benefiting as well and having
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
it on an annual basis still provides
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
that Clarity in context there's just no
 
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
electric measure I'm aware of that can
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
can stand up over 20 years like
 
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
weatherization does so if you're looking
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
at it on a lifetime basis it's kind of
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
an uneven playing field just because of
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
the the length of the measures we have
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
plenty of options to address 65 annual
 
00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:59.390 align:start position:0%
plenty of options to address 65 annual
because

00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
just going down the list of options for
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness we have a pretty
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
lengthy list of options just to balance
 
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:08.339 align:start position:0%
out with the weatherization it's
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
representative original has a question
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think I understand
 
00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
the lifetime equation can you use the
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
same example you gave and how that would
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
work with the annual version or how that
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
changes with this bill passes thank you
 
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
sure so I'll go through the the same
 
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
example again
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
um on the annual basis so if you have
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
650 annual kwh savings and you also got
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
weatherization work that amounted to 350
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
annual mmbtu savings for your heating
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
fuel if you use something other than
 
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
electricity that would be the annual
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
equation so you would be realizing 65
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
percent electric savings under that
 
00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:53.089 align:start position:0%
percent electric savings under that
scenario

00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
The Dilemma occurs when you now go out
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
how many years do those measures
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
maintain their cost Effectiveness above
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
the Baseline and your weatherization is
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
counted for 20 years so you're looking
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
at 7 000 mmbtus over the lifetime of
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
that measure
 
00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
but for electric savings it's a much
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
shorter lifespan and in my very basic
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
example we used 10 years and you're
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
winding up with less than half of your
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
your savings coming from Electric on a
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
lifetime basis but back to the annual
 
00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:29.339 align:start position:0%
you're at 65 percent at the front so you
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
you are getting
 
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:31.790 align:start position:0%
you are getting
um

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
by having the 650 kwh per year
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
it's just for a shorter number of years
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if that follow-up yeah thank
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
you um I guess my question is so in the
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
first let's say for the refrigerator for
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
this first seven years the annual would
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
make sense but what about for the eighth
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
year and after that wouldn't that be the
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
same problem not now on those years
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
you're now getting under because now the
 
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
fridger is no longer providing the
 
00:48:59.930 --> 00:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
savings yeah so the the refrigerator
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
savings would drop off to zero after
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
year seven in that example if it was a
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
seven year measure life we were able to
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
claim the savings and verify that
 
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
they're there for the seven years above
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
Baseline the refrigerator doesn't
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily die you don't need to
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
replace it but above the Baseline model
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
you were able to claim seven years for
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
that efficiency and after those seven
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
years regardless of whether the fridge
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
is still there and running fine or not
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
we're not able to claim any more savings
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
so it starts counting as a zero if you
 
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.510 align:start position:0%
so it starts counting as a zero if you
will

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a question
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.089 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to ask about the logic
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
of the weatherization lifetime only
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
considering heat
 
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
um since we're seeing Trends toward
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
electrification if he wouldn't it be
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable to assume that you know
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
weatherization project that's on a house
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
that's using oil now might actually save
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
on electricity down the line if in 10
 
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
years they switch over to a heat pump or
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
yes so if if the trends continue and
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
electrification continues with with heat
 
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:08.900 align:start position:0%
pump technology and other Technologies
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
then somebody who weatherized their home
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
this year very well could be saving on
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
electricity if they replace their their
 
00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.690 align:start position:0%
electricity if they replace their their
Heating

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
Heating
 
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up so it seems that it's kind of
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
impossible to accurately calculate
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
lifetime then right is that
 
00:50:32.089 --> 00:50:32.099 align:start position:0%
we have to use what we know at the time
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
which is the current heating fuel for
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
the customer we can't assume somebody's
 
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
going to switch from from oil to natural
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
gas or natural gas to electric or
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
anything else we have to assume what
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
they have in place when it comes time to
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
replace they'll they'll replace it with
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has another
 
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.089 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has another
question

00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:53.099 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I'm not an Ever
 
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
Source customer but I actually have
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
three ways to heat my house I have
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
electric in my upstairs I have a furnace
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
in my basement that's oil and forced hot
 
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
air for the basement and ground floor
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
and I have a wood stove so where I to
 
00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:12.049 align:start position:0%
and I have a wood stove so where I to
weatherize

00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
weatherize
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
I'm saving on all three of those sources
 
00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:17.390 align:start position:0%
I'm saving on all three of those sources
um

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
and of course the electric utility has
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
no idea how much wood I'm buying and has
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
no idea how much oil I'm buying from my
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
oil vendor over in Vermont
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
so how can we even calculate that
 
00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
so we would model that based on what
 
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
amount of fuel or Collective fuel you
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
would consume currently and then we can
 
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
assume the efficiency to be gained by
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
weatherizing your property and then we
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
can then allocate across the fuel types
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
that you currently consume what do we
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
assume would be saved for each of those
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
fuels and each one carries a different
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
mmbt value they they kind of are worth
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
different amounts but luckily I'm far
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
enough away removed from that
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
mathematical modeling itself I know
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
enough about it to explain it to others
 
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
but I don't work in the model on a
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
all right seeing
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
oh one more question from representative
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
McGee just from what you were just
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
testifying about it sounds to me as
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
though you're being given or the
 
00:52:29.049 --> 00:52:29.059 align:start position:0%
modelers are being given a lot more work
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh in order to try and satisfy leaving
 
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
the lifetime language or interpretation
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh without being addressed so in other
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
words if we uh pass this bill today and
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
clarify that it is annual savings that
 
00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
you're required to track then all this
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
the other machinations that you've been
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
running through trying to adapt to what
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
came out in that order will be satisfied
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would provide us with
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
additional flexibility it would preserve
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
the programs as they've historically
 
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.270 align:start position:0%
the programs as they've historically
operated

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
operated
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and it would preserve the funding
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
that we're able to provide within the
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:53:11.579 --> 00:53:12.410 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
seeing no more further no further
 
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
questions I should say from the
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee I want to thank you for being
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
here to testify and answer our questions
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it next we'll call on
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
Michael Krauss from the office of the
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman good morning
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
everyone I believe Senator avard and the
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
department of energy and our fine
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
friends at eversource did a great job
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
explaining a lot of the points that I
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
could have tried to explain to you today
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
but uh just to keep it simple the OCA
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
does emphatically support this bill as
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
everyone has mentioned these
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs are mature and
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
should this change not come into effect
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
they could be at risk mostly due to that
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
funding issue and how do you calculate
 
00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:02.339 align:start position:0%
those end results I'll keep my testimony
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
short and to the point so I don't repeat
 
00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:06.059 align:start position:0%
everything that's been said so if you
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
all have any questions for me I'm happy
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
to engage and save you all the rest of
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
the time thank you
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for the office of
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
you everyone appreciate you being here
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
next step
 
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.609 align:start position:0%
next step
is

00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to apologize in advance if
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
I don't pronounce this correctly
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
correctly but it looks like Joe
 
00:54:32.359 --> 00:54:34.069 align:start position:0%
correctly but it looks like Joe
mayola

00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
mayola
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:45.130 align:start position:0%
 
ah

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:45.140 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:54:51.609 --> 00:54:51.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
just to clarify in the future
 
00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.930 align:start position:0%
just to clarify in the future
um

00:54:59.930 --> 00:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to speak you can sign
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet rather than submitting a
 
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
that might
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
be more useful to everyone
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
all right next up is Nick Crick off of
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
and I believe you have submitted Nick
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
written testimony is that correct
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
yes I have chairman
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
um thank you good morning chairman good
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
morning committee members I'll be very
 
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
brief because I don't want to repeat
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
what others have already said this
 
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.770 align:start position:0%
what others have already said this
morning

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
um but one thing I want to reiterate
 
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
here is that SB 113 merely seeks to
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
accomplish the purpose of the
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
legislation from last year HP 549 that
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
was overwhelmingly approved
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
um you know as Mr Robert said following
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
the passage of HB 549
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
interpreted the bill in such a way that
 
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
effectively precludes the utilities from
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
investing in most weatherization
 
00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.390 align:start position:0%
investing in most weatherization
programs

00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
and this is really contrary to the
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of HB 549 from last year
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
which number one status sought to
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
establish stable funding for New
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves going forward including
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs and mandated
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
that the commission employs the same
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness tests that the
 
00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:20.579 align:start position:0%
commissioner used for previous reviews
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
of the plans of New Hampshire State's
 
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.750 align:start position:0%
of the plans of New Hampshire State's
plans

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
plans
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
um as we know weatherization programs
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
are one of the most cost effective
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
and you know they're very popular too
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
and so if you want to save a lot of
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
money on your on your energy bills every
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
every month you know you should you
 
00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
should invest in weatherization
 
00:56:40.619 --> 00:56:41.270 align:start position:0%
should invest in weatherization
um

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
and you know this this inability to
 
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
invest in weatherization programs
 
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
especially harms um low-income
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
households which benefit from some of
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
the low-income programs under the New
 
00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire safe plans and so
 
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
SB 113 would just undo the puc's
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation of um you know of the
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
existing law that was passed last year
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
and really put us in a place where we
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be last year which was
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know use the same cost Effectiveness
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
tests you know that have always been
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
used by the puc
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
um you know which was what which was
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
what the legislature tried to do last
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
year you know create stable funding
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
put us back to where we were and so
 
00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:23.339 align:start position:0%
um by making this small change this one
 
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
word change
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
um the utilities will be able to invest
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
in these popular and very cost effective
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs going forward
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
that can provide significant monthly
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
reductions and energy costs therefore I
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote in favor of sp-113 vote
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
odd to pass and happy to answer any
 
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.270 align:start position:0%
odd to pass and happy to answer any
questions

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
representative Christian
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.750 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
um so just to kind of restate what you
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
said in your understanding we've already
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
sort of litigated the 65 that was all
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
what we did last year and this is just
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
clarifying how that 65 you know how that
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
should be calculated going forward yeah
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
correct so I'm not here to relitigate
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
the 65 you know I don't question your
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
judgment and and putting that into law
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
but what what this law does is really
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know I think it's intent is to
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
accomplish the purpose of that
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
legislation from last year and really
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
just you know you use the same cost
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness tests that have always
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
been used by the puc until this this law
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
this um order from about a year ago that
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
you know is a really different different
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of how the puca had
 
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
Tom thank you Mr chairman um and just
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
following up on that
 
00:58:44.339 --> 00:58:45.349 align:start position:0%
following up on that
um

00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
is it it's your it's your testimony that
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
65 was a good number
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh when
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
it was understood as as you and others
 
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
everyone everyone understood that that
 
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
number applied to was a proper number
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
when the programs were evaluated on
 
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
their annual savings
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
correct I mean so I you know I don't
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
know where the 65 number came from
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
um you know and I you might have to ask
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill last year
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know the puc had always interpreted
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
um the savings on an annual basis and so
 
00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
you know what was new was that this idea
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be interpreted on this
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
this lifetime basis and so when looking
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
at past plans the puc had always
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
you know the utilities they've
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
calculated savings based on an annual
 
00:59:46.089 --> 00:59:46.099 align:start position:0%
basis and that's sort of how the puc
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
evaluated the savings was on this annual
 
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
basis because you know once you look at
 
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
this lifetime savings as Mr Le manager
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
has already testified very well you know
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
if things don't really add up because
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
just based on the lifetime you know how
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
long can these measures last and so
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the 65 percent you
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
know that there's a there's a
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
you know idea that we don't want
 
01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
electric customers paying for too much
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
non-electric Energy savings this
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
representative McGee um stated and so
 
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:19.740 align:start position:0%
you know I I think there is some
 
01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.569 align:start position:0%
you know I I think there is some
um

01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
you know there's some rationale to that
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense but
 
01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.089 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense but
um

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
you know what what's different is how
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
the sort of puc has sort of change that
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
interpretation from from past plans
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
the committee I want to thank you for
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
being here to testify today and next
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
I'll call on Ray Burke from the New
 
01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.849 align:start position:0%
I'll call on Ray Burke from the New
Hampshire

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you and good morning
 
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
um my name is Ray Burke I'm an attorney
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire legal assistants
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
we're a non-profit Law Firm represent
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
low-income Granite Staters throughout
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
the state in various civil legal issues
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we have an energy and utility
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
Justice project that works on matters
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
before the puc including the low-income
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency program and so I'm
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
here today to testify in support of this
 
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
bill and and ask that you vote ought to
 
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
pass like you've heard from the last
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
several folks um I'm not gonna I don't
 
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
want to repeat much of what was already
 
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
covered and that others could testify in
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
better detail there's a couple things I
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
think I could add that haven't been
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that may be helpful just very
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
briefly first as you heard you know the
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
the low income Energy Efficiency program
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
is is very important to our low-income
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
households uh in the past I don't have
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
updated numbers for you unfortunately
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
but there has been a wait list for the
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
program in large part to seek
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
weatherization services and and the
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
weather weatherization that's offered
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
through the program is an important tool
 
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
to help low-income customer customers
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
manage their energy costs
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
um the two new things I think that I can
 
01:01:59.809 --> 01:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
uh or maybe they're one thing but from
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
two different sources is
 
01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's been recognized by uh
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
both a national entity the American
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
Council for an energy efficient economy
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
and from the federal government and how
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
well we Implement our low-income program
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
the American Council for an energy
 
01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:18.059 align:start position:0%
efficient economy and its 2021 progress
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
report found that New Hampshire was
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
ranked only second to our neighbor
 
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
Vermont in our commitment to the
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
low-income program and how well we
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
implement it and as you heard from
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
others many of the low-income projects
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
there's a a lot of different there's
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
different funding sources that are used
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
namely rate payer-funded Energy
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency program we're talking about
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
today and the federal weatherization
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
assistance program and if this bill is
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
in past it makes it more difficult as I
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
understand it to coordinate those
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
programs together and to leverage uh
 
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
funding sources from both which has been
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
a success and so again we urge you to
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass so that we can
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
continue to build on that success and
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
build on the recognition we've received
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
and rather than than take a step
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
backwards um so I'm happy to answer any
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you again for the
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lewis lewicki
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
has a question for you okay thank you
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
um it would I'm trying to get an idea of
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
who these people the people are who
 
01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
benefit from this because in my
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
experience very often low-income people
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
are in rental housing aren't allowed to
 
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
change or do anything with the property
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
and so is this some very small swath of
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
people who are low income who happen to
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
own their own properties no uh folks who
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
are renters are allowed to participate
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
in both the ratepayer-funded Energy
 
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
Efficiency program and the federal
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program the
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
utilities and the Community Action
 
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
agencies uh work with the homeowners to
 
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
to do that you do need of course the
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
homeowner's permission
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
um so that the renter can't just go and
 
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
sign up but but they are eligible if
 
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
they meet the requirements and if the
 
01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.670 align:start position:0%
they meet the requirements and if the
homeowner

01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
homeowner
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
um wants to uh you know to work with the
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
utilities and the Community Action
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
just to clarify I think by saying
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
homeowner you're talking about landlord
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay but and of course if the
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
low-income household owns the home they
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
obviously they can participate which I
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
think you were saying earlier but yes
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions want to
 
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and we'll Now call
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
on our last presenter on Senate Bill 113
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
and that is Sam Evans Brown of clean
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I will of course
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
be brief I don't want to repeat anything
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's been said um I I wanted to
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
make two points one is to simply try to
 
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
explain the lifetime and annual question
 
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh uh as if the way I would do it to a
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
um to my grandmother for instance
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so imagine you have a fridge and you
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
have some insulation uh the fridge saves
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
two energies a year the installation
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
saves two energies a year the
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
installation lasts 25 years the fridge
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
lasts 10. uh the fridge will save you 20
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
energies the installation will save you
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
50 and that throws off the 65 ratio
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
question but if you look at them on an
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
annual basis they both save two so they
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
meet the test and so that's that's the
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
basic question that we're trying to to
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
solve for here the other thing I'd say
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh is that it's really important I think
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
to remember that the workforce that
 
01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
pursues these weatherization programs is
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to maintain many
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire member
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
companies are these weatherization
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
contractors that the type of person who
 
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
wants to put on a Tyvek suit and go into
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
a 140 degree Attic in the summer and
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
blow insulation into the attic is a
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
difficult worker to get your hands on
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
and to hold on to so certainty and and
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
stability in these programs is very
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
important I think that if we had not had
 
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
the puc order that we had in the fall of
 
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
2021 we would have been able to do much
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
more weatherization coming into the rate
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
shock that we saw this winter because I
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
can tell you for a fact that that a lot
 
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
of the contractors were very hesitant to
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
hire new workers because of the
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
uncertainty that these programs are
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
facing so that's a simple thing I'd hope
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
that policymakers would remember
 
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
habitat questions or not
 
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you appreciate it
 
01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
and with that we're done with Senate
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
bill 113.
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm hopeful that Senator Waters is
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to introduce the next bill
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay interesting
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
so now we will open a public hearing on
 
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:48.380 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 161 relative to low moderate
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
income Community solar projects and I'll
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
call on Senator Waters to testify on
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation on behalf of Senator
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
Perkins quoka who is the Bill's Prime
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor Senator Waters thank you thank
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
good to see you all uh this morning I'm
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of Senator Perkins uh
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
quote to introduce Senate bill
 
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
um 61.
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
and um you know we there's been a lot of
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
questions about what does this renewable
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
energy that we're been working on for
 
01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059 align:start position:0%
the last few years does it really get
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
down and help over income folks and I
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
think as we heard in the last bill that
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of efforts to do that
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
and one of the very good things that we
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
did was to um pass the law modern income
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
Community solar project
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
a bill a few years back and this bill
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
attempts to do two things first it it
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
wants to make sure that
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
um projects that are housing authorities
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
and rental properties are able to enter
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
into Community solar projects that
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
benefit eligible and moderate income
 
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:57.059 align:start position:0%
customers now to do that it does two
 
01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
things it tries to
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
rotten out as you'll see in the bowl in
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
the first line starting line six there
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
broadened out a little bit the
 
01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.549 align:start position:0%
broadened out a little bit the
eligibility

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
requirements so that we have an
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
alternative to the federal poverty
 
01:08:11.339 --> 01:08:12.589 align:start position:0%
alternative to the federal poverty
guidelines

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
um and this is useful in a couple of a
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons that we know what our
 
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
median income costs are in New Hampshire
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're pretty darn high and so this
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
recognizes that people who are under a
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of the annual median
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
income are probably challenged getting
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
some housing and so it would be good for
 
01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
them if they are in public housing or in
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
a rental units so supported that these
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects would be
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
available to help them reduce their um
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
their energy energy costs and so we do
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
this in in two places in the in the bill
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
um and uh you will see them in the two
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
sections of the law and this will have
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
um a you know real uh help
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
um it'll allow for more loan and modern
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
income customers to benefit from clean
 
01:09:07.249 --> 01:09:07.259 align:start position:0%
energy projects we heard a lot from the
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
Keene Housing Authority about just how
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
this would uh how this would uh work
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
there it would open up the grant program
 
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
a little more
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
um broadly to help out low income uh
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
folks we also heard from the Department
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
of energy who worked on
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
um that this in some ways was uh also
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
dealing with a kind of a technical thing
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
that um let's say you had a lot of
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
different low-income folks or various
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
various income levels
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
um in a building that had just one meter
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
and so it would be very hard to know
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
exactly which one which individuals in
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
that building would qualify at the
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
federal level but if you have the one
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
meter and you can look at the Ami for
 
01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299 align:start position:0%
the residents there then that technical
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
correction will let them those folks
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for the program I probably have
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
just about reached my knowledge limits
 
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
on this bill because I'm here standing
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
in for Senator Perkins coal Club but I
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
know there'll be some others who can get
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
into more of the details on that so it's
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
not exactly just the technical
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
correction but I think it takes the
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
spirit of the program it makes it work a
 
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
little better for New Hampshire thank
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for introducing Senate
 
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.430 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for introducing Senate
Bill

01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
161. do we have questions for the
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
senator representative McGee has one
 
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.070 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
um

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
um
I'm

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
my question really is uh if you look at
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
the targeted nature of the bill would
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
you say that an indirect benefit would
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
be to help stabilize rental costs as
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
well as utility costs because I feel
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
like that might be another piece we
 
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
should be aware of
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
I think it'll help I think if you look
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
at the overall picture of
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
um low to moderate income folks who are
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
facing high energy bills potentially
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
high-end bills other utility bills and
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
and whatever else and this kind of
 
01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.290 align:start position:0%
and whatever else and this kind of
program

01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
can kind of raise their boats in a
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
certain way by helping deal with some of
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
these fences I can speak personally to
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
an experience that the Somersworth
 
01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:14.179 align:start position:0%
housing project which is in my district
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
and they did weatherization rehab and a
 
01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
lot of work there and then brought an
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
energy Supply through Community solar to
 
01:11:24.169 --> 01:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
help through the community action
 
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
program to help that and you know it's
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
it's not just that you're helping people
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
by income you're helping People's Health
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
too because they're they're living in
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
cleaner warmer
 
01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
um better you know better served
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
buildings and uh able to get some help
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
on their their energy as well so um this
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
is what we're hearing from the community
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
action projects the the housing
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
authorities that this small change here
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
will mean they can actually make the
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
intent of the program work for more of
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
the residents thank you for your
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
question thanks
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
additional questions for the senator
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has one thank you
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Senator
 
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.450 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Senator
um

01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
now the radio isn't necessarily a good
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
source of data but I've been hearing
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
that rents are up by 50 percent over the
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
past short period of time and it would
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
seem that energy costs would be so far
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
down in the noise that it just not a
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
concern to most renters would you
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
disagree or agree with that well thanks
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
for your question I think what we're
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
looking at folks who because of that
 
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
brutal rental market are able to take
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of public housing or other
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
kinds of rental units and so that this
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
is a piece of that that puzzle that is
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
for there for the for those folks in
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
particular who are included under the
 
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.470 align:start position:0%
particular who are included under the
Community

01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
Community
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
solar and Community energy projects so
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
um times are tough and this is something
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
we can do to help
 
01:12:49.739 --> 01:12:51.350 align:start position:0%
we can do to help
um

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative bereshny has one thank
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
you chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
question uh can you give a sense of how
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
much larger the program would be with
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
this language or what some numbers or
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
just an idea is this going to double the
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
amount of of possible projects or
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
um well I I Mr chairman I don't know if
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
you have someone here from one of the
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
public housing authorities from who's
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
going to be coming to testify who might
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
give you some numbers on that I would I
 
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
will just take a question but I will
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
just say that you know we have overall
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
limits on how much goes into this
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
program in general so I'm not sure how
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
that really all all will play out but
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's an eligibility for for funding that
 
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
can potentially help people and uh
 
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
and that's what we heard from The
 
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:48.229 align:start position:0%
and that's what we heard from The
Advocates

01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um who's paying
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm sorry I haven't prepared
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
morphis I just heard I had to come in I
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
know the whole I I will look if you look
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
to that um if you look to RSA 362 F2 you
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
will find how we do this essentially
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
what the program allows is for peop
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
people who want to make investments in
 
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
these programs the um well modern income
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
solar projects that if individuals can
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
be aggregated
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
so that there are enough customers that
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
can off take the development of a of a
 
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
solar power project then the financing
 
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
numbers work for the entity that wants
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
to come in and construct such a such a
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
project and so that's that's basically
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
how how the products to build investors
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
do them and then under this program they
 
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
can aggregate those little
 
01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
moderate income customers for solar
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
and and Mr chairman I think you probably
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
know better than anyone how to answer
 
01:14:59.209 --> 01:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
that question but I'm as I said I was
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
caught a little off guard by having to
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
come in today with this yeah it's quite
 
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
all right yeah I have a question or a
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
question actually
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
seven

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
and 28 of the bill
 
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
there is language that refers to RSA
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
and there is a word
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
on each of those lines or a phrase on
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
each of those lines that says as defined
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
I looked at RSA 78 and it
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
in turn refers to Federal
 
01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:45.830 align:start position:0%
in turn refers to Federal
statute

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
so would it be better to change the
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
words as defined to as described
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
you think that's a reason that would be
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
a reasonable change
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question chairman I
 
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:00.020 align:start position:0%
think you know oftentimes in Statue we
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
essentially are deferring a reference to
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
a federal statute and so since we aren't
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
defining it but somebody else says that
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
really does make some sense
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
further questions for the senator
 
01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you senator
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
Next Step we're going to call on Griffin
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh members of the
 
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
committee again Griffin Roberge from the
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the department is
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
neutral to Senate Bill 161 as amended by
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
um for some background uh the general
 
01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
court passed and Governor sunew signed
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
into law in 2017 uh Senate Bill 129
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
which mandated that the department
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
allocate no less than 15 percent of the
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
monies in the state's renewable energy
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
fund annually to the low to moderate
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
income Community solar program as
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
defined by Statute this program is
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
designed to quote benefit low to
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
moderate income residential customers
 
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to the
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
financing or leveraging of financing for
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
low to moderate income Community solar
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
projects and manufactured housing
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
communities or in in multi-family rental
 
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.430 align:start position:0%
communities or in in multi-family rental
housing

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.030 align:start position:0%
housing
um

01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
following the passage of this bill the
 
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
program was designed through an
 
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
extensive stakeholder process that would
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
meet the statutory requirements and
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
allow for the review and evaluation of
 
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
multiple different uh project models
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
since the program's creation the
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
department has typically issued a
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
competitive requests for proposals or
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
rfps soliciting project proposals to
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
fund the Department's latest RFP closed
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
on March 30th of this year to date the
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
program has awarded roughly 1.4 million
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
in grant funding to eight LMI Community
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
solar projects the program has
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
successfully helped complete two
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
projects in Laconia and one in Lebanon
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Tilton and Dunbarton two
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
projects are currently underway in
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
stratum in North Conway the projects
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
that have been completed and will be
 
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
completed include about 164 different
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
participants and I want to clarify that
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
participants means households so the
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
number of individuals who are benefiting
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
from the program are likely higher
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
um regarding the bill before you today
 
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
Uh current statute onlines
 
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
three to twelve everything but the
 
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
bolded language
 
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
um indic defined what a low to moderate
 
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
income Community solar project is that
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
definition requires that such projects
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
must directly benefit a group of at
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
least five residential and use customers
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
where at least the majority majority uh
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know meaning three of the
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
residential end user customers are at or
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
below 300 percent of the federal poverty
 
01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:08.270 align:start position:0%
below 300 percent of the federal poverty
guidelines

01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
um as has been mentioned by Senator
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
Waters in the past there have been
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
proposals by housing authorities to
 
01:19:16.729 --> 01:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
apply to this program and receive grant
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
funding however the department has had
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
to turn away those proposals because of
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
the current statutory definition
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
as you'll see the definition requires uh
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
benefits to flow directly to residential
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
end users essentially that means that
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
those end users need to have their own
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
meter as has been mentioned by Senator
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
Waters when it comes to public housing
 
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
authorities or other types of housing
 
01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
projects that can tend to be a Master
 
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
Meter just one
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
um in which case given the current
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
statutory definition those projects
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
aren't able to qualify the bolded
 
01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:50.780 align:start position:0%
language that you see online 6 to 11
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
means housing authorities and similar
 
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
housing projects that have not been
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
program eligible in the past will be
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of this program
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to become law
 
01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:05.219 align:start position:0%
section 2 Down Below on line 27 on page
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
one uh again is just a further add-on
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
that allows these program dollars to
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
flow to residents of a public housing
 
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
authority or a housing project and that
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
really concludes my testimony I will
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
note that
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
um we are working with chairman Vos on
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
and please tell me Mr chairman if I'm
 
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
treading into the territory I'm not
 
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
um but we are working on an amendment to
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
address some technical changes to this
 
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill including the uh one that the
 
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
chairman mentioned to
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters when he testified and
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
with that happy to take any questions
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Roberge just for
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
clarification I did submit some language
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
to ask OLS and requested that it be
 
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
delivered by nine o'clock this morning
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
and OLS for whatever reason was unable
 
01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:55.910 align:start position:0%
and OLS for whatever reason was unable
to

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh accommodate that request so we still
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
do not have Amendment language but we're
 
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
not executing this bill today so
 
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
we'll get it when we get it all right
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr robes for
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
being here
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I I did have a question and I think
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
the chairman referenced
 
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
um RSA 78 B2 and I and I looked at that
 
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.149 align:start position:0%
um RSA 78 B2 and I and I looked at that
language

01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
and the in there it's it talks about
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
um low income low to moderate income
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects receiving an
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
additional looks like an additional
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
um credit
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
um net metering credit
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
of 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I guess what I'm trying to
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
understand is is the purp is that is
 
01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
that correct and then is the purpose of
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
this bill to extend that benefit to a
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
broader Universe of projects sure and
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so the 2.5
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
percent Adder
 
01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
um was done in 2.5 cents what'd I say
 
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
oh sorry cents per kilo forgive me uh
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
2.5 cents a kilowatt at per kilowatt
 
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.950 align:start position:0%
2.5 cents a kilowatt at per kilowatt
hour

01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
um was an add-on in legislation
 
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
couple years back I can't remember the
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill but it is meant again to enhance
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
that benefit for low to moderate income
 
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
that benefit for low to moderate income
communities

01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
um it put me up a little bit against a
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
wall here I can't I can follow back up
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
with you but it's my understanding that
 
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
cert you can qualify for that Adder
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
under certain conditions you can't
 
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.410 align:start position:0%
under certain conditions you can't
always

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I have to look at the statute again
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
to kind of unpack that but again the
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
Genesis of that language is to ensure
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
that more program benefits flow to those
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
at the lower end of the economic ladder
 
01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.450 align:start position:0%
at the lower end of the economic ladder
follow-up

01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah what I was trying to
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
understand was if I understand correctly
 
01:22:58.130 --> 01:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
yep what we're doing is we're changing
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
the definition of a low to moderate
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
income Community solar project yep
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
and if by and by doing that we would
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
include housing authorities and other oh
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
yes correct so therefore
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
without apps in any other change those
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
projects would then be eligible for this
 
01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
additional credit uh potentially again
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
depending on the on the adder
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
requirements that are in statute again I
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
just can't remember off the top of my
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
head but yes correct thank you
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
Roberts for being here
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
um to follow up on a previous question
 
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh to the previous testimony do you have
 
01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
any idea the number of increased
 
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
participants that would be eligible for
 
01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
low moderate income solar projects under
 
01:23:47.209 --> 01:23:47.219 align:start position:0%
this new sure and thank you for the
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
question and a follow-up if I can
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
squeeze it in there where where can we
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
find uh information about the low
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
moderate uh solar income so I'm going to
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
take the first question first uh or the
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
last question first
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
um the Department per statute has I
 
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
believe issued two different reports
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the LMI Community solo program
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
I think the last one was done sometime
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
last year I can certainly provide links
 
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
to those reports there's also annual
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
information regarding program successes
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
um in our annual renewable energy fund
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
reports and again I can fire that off to
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.050 align:start position:0%
the committee
um

01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember your first
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
question regarding the uh amount the
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
increased amount of folks who could take
 
01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.530 align:start position:0%
increased amount of folks who could take
part

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
um obviously
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
um public housing authorities uh as they
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
are defined under statute would be
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
eligible to take part I don't know
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
offhand the number of entities who would
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
be able to take part maybe around maybe
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 20 20. okay
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
um I think and there are also public
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
housing folks here today who might be
 
01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
able to answer that and again I really
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
can't predict the futurist to how many
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
would apply to this program
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
um but yes I I think there would be a
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
fair amount of folks would be able to
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:02.219 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and this is
 
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
actually a qualification clarification
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
question on your proposed amendment does
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
it change anything other than the
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
terminology defined to described sure
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you it's for the chair
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
actually I'm going to let him answer
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
that because the amendment language was
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
submitted by the department sure
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question so yeah
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
um yes our proposed amendment would
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
alter line seven
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
and line eight to remove the word
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
defined to described and the reason
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
being is that there is no specific
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
definition in that area of Statute and
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
78b colon 2 regarding a housing project
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
but it does list a number of uh
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
federally funded low-income housing
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
projects and we'd like to cat I think
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
the Genesis is to capture those folks
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
there is another there is another
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
amendment we are proposing but it's not
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
to the language outlined in this bill it
 
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
seeks to amend some language that was
 
01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
passed in Senate Bill 270 last year
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
um that we are working with on the
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
amendment but that Senate Bill 270 built
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
on top of this program to require the
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
department to establish a way to
 
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
identify low to moderate income
 
01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.490 align:start position:0%
identify low to moderate income
customers

01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
who could take part in these programs
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
the department to create that program
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
needs to establish administrative Rule
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
and as I think this committee is aware
 
01:26:24.189 --> 01:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
we are currently in the midst of
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
revising our administrative rules given
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
the breakup between the puc and the doe
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
with this program on top of it it is a
 
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
significant administrative burden our
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment would allow the
 
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
department to create
 
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I guess you could say administrative
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
rules for this new program by order or
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
rule to allow us to create a kind of
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
structure by rule until those rules are
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
formalized through the administrative
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process the Genesis of that
 
01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
is that we don't want you know
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily Bad actors taking advantage
 
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
of just what's in statute you could have
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
poor in inadequate applications come
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
forward we'd like to have some built and
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
suspenders there for that follow up
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up and so will this amendment
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
come with a fiscal note I I I thank you
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
for the question I don't don't imagine
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
it would just because it's really kind
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
of technical in nature
 
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's how I think I'd answer
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative lewicki
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
has a question uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr robesch
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and it's perhaps another testifier
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for this but there
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
seems that there may be another
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
constraint involved which is real estate
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
and it would seem that you know when
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking public housing much of it
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
does not have any place to put solar in
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
any significant way would you disagree
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
or agree with that well thank you for
 
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
the question I think I I think I might a
 
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
little bit push back on that is that
 
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
obviously each public housing authority
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
project is different there's ground
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
mounted rooftop mounted that type of
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
thing uh but you know in past projects
 
01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
the focus has been obviously directing
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
the benefits and it's obviously the
 
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
requirement of the program is directing
 
01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
the benefits of that Pro of those
 
01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
projects to low to moderate income
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
customers themselves
 
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
um obviously it's up to the applicant to
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
determine what what works best whether
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
rooftop mounted works best or ground
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
mounting did
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I would say holistically our
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
projects tend to be less than 100 KW
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
um just because it gets in that sweet
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
spot of where the benefits could maybe
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
flow down better to low to moderate
 
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
income customers
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative munz has
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
another question thank you Mr chair
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
um just following up on representative
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
naughter's question earlier
 
01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:42.790 align:start position:0%
naughter's question earlier
um

01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
section two of the of the bill
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
um all that does is make more
 
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh projects eligible for a fixed pot of
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
money correct it doesn't expand the
 
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's available in the
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund that's correct I
 
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
would I would submit that the bill
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
represents an effort to expand
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
eligibility for a current program in the
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
department and that program is funded
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
through the renewable energy fund and I
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
think we're all aware that that fund is
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
funded through alternative compliance
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
payments made through the state's
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard follow-up
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up so there's no additional
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for Mr
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
roberg we'll Now call on
 
01:29:34.729 --> 01:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
Josh Meehan
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
from Keene
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
and he will tell us who he represents
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Meehan from for driving
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
over from Keene sure thing thank you Mr
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks everybody on the
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh yeah my name is Josh Meehan
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'm executive director of keen housing
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
we're the city of Keynes public housing
 
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.830 align:start position:0%
we're the city of Keynes public housing
authority

01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
I also serve as the chair of the New
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Authority
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
corporation's legislative committee I
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
live in Keene and I'm speaking in
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
support of the bill today which allow
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
organizations like ours to apply for low
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
moderate income Community solar grants
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
at our properties where utilities are
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
included in the rent this is the Master
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
Meter discussion that's been been going
 
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:13.850 align:start position:0%
Meter discussion that's been been going
on

01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
we've applied twice for grant funding
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
through the community solar program and
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
twice have been found ineligible because
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
we provide the electricity to our
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
residents and it's included in the rent
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
Keen housing owns and manages almost 600
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
units of affordable housing in Keene
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
Swansea Marlborough 43 percent of our
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
residents are disabled 40 percent of the
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
households we serve have children
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
and while over 90 percent of our work
 
01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
able households are employed the
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
majority of the households we serve earn
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
less than 30 percent of area median
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
income which for a family of four is
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
around thirty two thousand dollars a
 
01:30:50.219 --> 01:30:51.110 align:start position:0%
around thirty two thousand dollars a
year

01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
some of you may know Keen is a city of
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
approximately 23 000 people
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
and as I sit here today we have 2 000
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
people on our waiting lists
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
households with kids can wait up to two
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
years for a two-bedroom apartment that
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
we own and manage and an elder could
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
wait up to seven years for an apartment
 
01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
depending on which department which
 
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
development they choose to live in
 
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
I like to give that perspective I know
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily relevant to the
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill but it it I think it's important
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
for people to have that perspective
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
um we receive no state or local funding
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
for maintaining our aging housing stock
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
or to develop new housing instead we
 
01:31:33.169 --> 01:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
rely on a combination of federal
 
01:31:35.689 --> 01:31:35.699 align:start position:0%
operating subsidy and a patchwork of
 
01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
federal grants and tax credits none of
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
which are are sources that we can
 
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.050 align:start position:0%
which are are sources that we can
control

01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
what we do have some control over though
 
01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
is our operating costs
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
every dollar that we save in operating
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
costs we redeploy to maintain our aging
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
housing stock to improve resident
 
01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
services and when we can to develop new
 
01:31:59.930 --> 01:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
housing that is desperately needed
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
I think as everyone on this committee is
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
probably very well aware electricity
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
rates have gone up significantly
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
recently and even though we secure our
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
power through Power purchase agreements
 
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're still impacted by these Rising
 
01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.129 align:start position:0%
we're still impacted by these Rising
costs

01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
this year so for contacts this year our
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
operating budget is 2.5 million dollars
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
and 570 thousand dollars is going to be
 
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
our electric bill this year
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
so it gives you some perspective on the
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
impact that electricity costs have on us
 
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
we've already completed extensive Energy
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
Efficiency retrofitting and building
 
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
envelope tightening throughout our
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio and we've actually completed
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
three solar projects through solar power
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
right now we generate about a half a
 
01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
megawatt altogether but we consume close
 
01:32:49.729 --> 01:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
to four megawatts a year so we've got a
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
lot of Gap to make up and we're proud of
 
01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
the progress that we've made but the
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
solar ppas as many of you probably know
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
don't Supply us with free energy it's
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
energy that's cheaper than if we went to
 
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
the default rate but it does increase
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
those costs do increase over time as
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
well so this brings me back to the bill
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing right now if we
 
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
could compete for the grants that up
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
till today we are unable to compete for
 
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
that would help us build solar projects
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
that we owned outright and and if we
 
01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
couldn't own them out right because we
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
still need to to get more Capital to do
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
the projects it would at least reduce
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
the payback time on the on the solar
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreements so we could
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
build more arrays be less leveraged and
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
move more quickly to reduce our costs
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
so allowing us access to the low
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
moderate income Community solar grant
 
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
program with directly and positively
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
impact our ability to maintain our aging
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
portfolio improve the services we offer
 
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
our residents and increase the housing
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
stock without any new state local or
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
federal funding this the passage of this
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't be a Panacea for the
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
housing crisis that we're facing in the
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
state but it certainly would be an
 
01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:03.980 align:start position:0%
important contribution towards
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
addressing it so thanks very much for
 
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
letting me come and testify today and
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer some of the more
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
technical Housing Authority like
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
questions that we're kind of banging
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
around earlier if you like
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
yeah our thanks go to you for being here
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
to testify you have a perspective
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
different from virtually everybody else
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
who's been here so we we really do
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your being here thank
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
you and representative munz has a
 
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
you for coming in
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
um you've heard if you you've heard from
 
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
a number of us we're trying to
 
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
understand the number of
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
new potential projects that this could
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
include in the program
 
01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
the housing number of housing
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
authorities that's pretty clear but do
 
01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
you have any sense at all as to what the
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
number of those other housing projects
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
would be that are included in the bill
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
well um it's the answer unfortunately is
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
um uh opaque and wonky
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
um so housing authorities when we
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
develop affordable housing now the the
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
the federal uh source of funding for
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
that is something called the low income
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit program so nobody's
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
building new public housing but housing
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
authorities could come in to do solar on
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
existing public housing and have all the
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
great benefits that have been discussed
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
but there are so many different sort of
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
products if you will for affordable
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
housing it's really hard to say how many
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
entities there are that that could
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
potentially compete for uh for the
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
grants but that's really what the
 
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
language does it allows other affordable
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
housing providers who here to four have
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
been cut out from competing for those
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
okay representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
um this is a hypothetical question but
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
should this bill pass how would it
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
directly benefit your your existing
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
program well we've as I mentioned
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
earlier in my testimony we've applied
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
twice for this grant
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and we would prepare to apply a third
 
01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.470 align:start position:0%
um and we would prepare to apply a third
time

01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
and that as I mentioned that would if if
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
we were successful in our Grant
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
application it would allow us to move to
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
our next solar project basically we have
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
a goal of getting the carbon neutrality
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
by 2035 as an organization but I should
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
point out not only because we think it's
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
important to be to be reducing our
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
fairly large carbon footprint but
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
arguably more importantly it saves us a
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
lot of operating costs and it allows us
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
to do our mission better
 
01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:48.659 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you
 
01:36:50.689 --> 01:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
um and you said that you you generate
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
0.5 megawatts and you consume four so if
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
you had another uh project in what would
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
would be the size of it well we
 
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
typically do as was mentioned earlier
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
most of our projects are under a hundred
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
because there's a there's a tech the way
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the regulations are designed today
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
that's sort of The Sweet Spot so
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
generally what we do is relatively small
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
but but meaningful projects behind the
 
01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
meters on the roofs of our of our
 
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
portfolio and as I mentioned we have 600
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
units spread across 15 or 16 properties
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
and we've only put solar on three so far
 
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
so we've got a lot of work to do okay
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr Sheehan thank
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
you very much for making the long drive
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you got it my pleasure thank you
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.229 align:start position:0%
very much next up is Jason quasnick or
Joseph

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman intending to testifying 167.
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
my apologies I misread your card I have
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
so many up here
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay Mr kwasnick is coming up later
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
so now we have Sam Evans Brown if he's
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
still Sam is still here yes Good Sam
 
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
still here indeed
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
the committee again for the record I'm
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
Sam Evans Brown executive director of
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
um just to reiterate what was what has
 
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
already been said uh this is a program
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
that the state has already enacted is
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
already in statute but is actually
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
struggling to find projects to give the
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
funding out to last year there were
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
there were two projects that applied for
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
the low to moderate income uh renewable
 
01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
energy fund grants both were housing
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
authorities both were denied and this
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
money was not given out and so we're
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
really just trying to make an existing
 
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
program that is already funded work so
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
that said I think there's there's a
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
broader question here that the committee
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
has has touched on a number of times and
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
that's the question of how do we make
 
01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
sure that the programs that the state is
 
01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
enacting that are trying to reduce the
 
01:38:59.090 --> 01:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
energy burden for our residents actually
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
function for folks who do not who are
 
01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
not who are not themselves homeowners
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's a problem of split incentives if
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
you are a landlord and you do not pay
 
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
the the energy bills of your 10 you have
 
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
no incentive to invest in Energy
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
Efficiency or any sort of on-site
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
generation to try to reduce the bills
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
for your tenant because that's only
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
costs for you however if you do as the
 
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
housing authorities do and you you pay
 
01:39:25.729 --> 01:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
the energy bills for your tenants that
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
then means that you become ineligible
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
for many of the the types of incentives
 
01:39:31.729 --> 01:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
that the state makes available to reduce
 
01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
energy spending and that is that is a
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
that is a problem that I would hope that
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
policymakers would take very seriously
 
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
and this is just a modest step in the
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
direction of trying to trying to again
 
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
reduce energy burden for New Hampshire's
 
01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:46.430 align:start position:0%
reduce energy burden for New Hampshire's
residents

01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Mr Evans Brown
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you uh you you
 
01:39:57.649 --> 01:39:57.659 align:start position:0%
just mentioned something that kind of
 
01:39:59.330 --> 01:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
raised it an interesting question in my
 
01:40:05.410 --> 01:40:05.420 align:start position:0%
mind so if a if if if there is a a
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
situation where a group of low-income
 
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
situation where a group of low-income
um

01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
tenants live in a building owned by a a
 
01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.030 align:start position:0%
tenants live in a building owned by a a
landlord

01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.890 align:start position:0%
landlord
um

01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
if they want to try to participate in
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
or a program that would reduce their and
 
01:40:27.649 --> 01:40:27.659 align:start position:0%
they pay their own utility bills and
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
they want to participate in a program to
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
reduce their utility bills does this
 
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
does this program a lot you know allow
 
01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:35.330 align:start position:0%
does this program a lot you know allow
that

01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh or is there other language that needs
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be added to facilitate that so so
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
sort of depends on the ownership
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
structure right so if if they are simply
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
a group of of low-income residents that
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
are taking that you know renting from
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
Market housing and it's not um it's not
 
01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
participating in any sort of program for
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
low-income folks that group of tenants
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
would have to work with their landlord
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
to and theoretically with some sort of
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
entity that could submit the application
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
on their behalf in order to put in a a
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
Grant application to this competitive
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
program which would be pretty
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
complicated Endeavor which I think tells
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
you why we don't see many of those
 
01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
you why we don't see many of those
applications

01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
um it's it's precisely this problem that
 
01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
led clean energy New Hampshire to work
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 270 last year which was
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
passed on a bipartisan basis through
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
this body which which automatically
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
assigns uh off takers for for low-income
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
solar projects from the roles of folks
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
who are already participating in the
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
electric assistance program where there
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
there are so many barriers that are in
 
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
place you know I think we have to get
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
creative about how we work to eliminate
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
those barriers so I think the answer is
 
01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
to your question is sort of depends on
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
who owns the building
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
um but the answer might in most cases be
 
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
no which I think uh suggests that there
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
there's still other policies that the
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
legislature could consider in terms of
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
how do you eliminate barriers to the
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
programs that that we've enacted to try
 
01:42:05.169 --> 01:42:05.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so in follow-up to
 
01:42:12.649 --> 01:42:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative Munn's question
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
um can we clarify that the testimony
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we heard from the Keen Housing
 
01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
Authority is really who it's targeted at
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
is existing housing authorities who
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
would very much like to be able to lower
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
their electric bills for their tenants
 
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
and for themselves for their operating
 
01:42:30.649 --> 01:42:30.659 align:start position:0%
costs uh so it's it's targeted that is
 
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
right and and uh and initially so uh we
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
have worked extensively with the
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy on drafting this
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
language along with Mr Meehan from the
 
01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:40.139 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority initially this bill
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
was much much simpler in its language uh
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
but the feedback was that uh that very
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
simple language did not recognize the
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
reality of how low-income and affordable
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
housing is is built and managed by the
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
housing authorities and as you have as
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
you could have heard uh you know I got
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
essentially a master seminar from Mr
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
Meehan and exactly how the housing
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
authorities work uh and it's it's
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
immensely complex which is why the bill
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
has to be as complicated as it as it is
 
01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr Sam Evans Brown
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
and next we'll call on Dan weeks to give
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
us the
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm I assume you'll assume you're uh
 
01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
introduce your guest to us sidekick here
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
um was not able to go to school today

and mom has to teach so I hope you don't
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
mind me having some company here of
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
course not thank you chairman Vos and
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Dan
 
01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
weeks vice president at revision energy
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
um glad to be with you from Nashua this
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
morning with my trusty sidekick
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
um very briefly we are a construction
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
company employee owned we do solar and
 
01:44:00.890 --> 01:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
various Clean Energy Solutions
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
um and I'm one of 400 co-owners most of
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
my fellow employees are on roofs or in
 
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
basements or attics today it's a
 
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
beautiful day to be installing clean
 
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
energy in New Hampshire and we're proud
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
to count uh electricians apprentices
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
plumbers Etc among our co-owners
 
01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.609 align:start position:0%
plumbers Etc among our co-owners
um

01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
very grateful for the opportunity to
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
testify in support of SB 161 because I
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
think it goes to what has been an
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
important bright spot in New Hampshire's
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
clean energy policy over the last
 
01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
several years in identifying and seeking
 
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
to prioritize the needs of lower income
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
granted Staters to participate in the
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
clean energy transition and to enjoy the
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
cost-saving benefits that result
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh I think we are probably all aware
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately for most of the last
 
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:53.699 align:start position:0%
several decades since solar has been a
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
solution available to families it's been
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
mostly higher income
 
01:45:00.649 --> 01:45:00.659 align:start position:0%
folks who have been able to take
 
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
advantage in far too few of those who
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
who get the benefits and cost savings
 
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
from solar are folks on low incomes and
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
so I want to First appreciate the way in
 
01:45:13.609 --> 01:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
which this legislature and Governor snow
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
have prioritized this important need of
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
expanding access to these Solutions and
 
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
support this particular fix to do what I
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
think all parties intended in the
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
original legislation setting out our LMI
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
programs and just make it more effective
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh for revision as an employee-owned B
 
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
Corporation expanding access to solar is
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
core to our mission yet I'm sorry to say
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
that of the roughly 15 000 installations
 
01:45:45.649 --> 01:45:45.659 align:start position:0%
we've completed only a few hundred have
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
been for very low income folks here in
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and in neighboring states
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
where we work and we really want to
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
change that for every year in which the
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
formerly puc Grant programs have been
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
available through the renewable energy
 
01:46:04.090 --> 01:46:04.100 align:start position:0%
fund we have applied we've worked with
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities mobile home
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
communities we've worked with Keen
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
housing and other housing authorities
 
01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:12.659 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and it has been I
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
think the to the disappointment of
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
everybody involved that multiple
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise good projects have just not
 
01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:21.260 align:start position:0%
been able to go forward
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
particularly because these projects
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
generally with housing authorities keen
 
01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
and others serve the lowest income
 
01:46:30.669 --> 01:46:30.679 align:start position:0%
granted Staters out there
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
and it is for multiple good reasons that
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
I think you've already heard that their
 
01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
bills tend to be paid directly by the
 
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority but again the
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence has been that
 
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
those individuals cannot participate
 
01:46:49.129 --> 01:46:49.139 align:start position:0%
I would simply stress that what we're
 
01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
talking about here is not increasing the
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
funding available although that might be
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
nice we're simply talking about
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
expanding the ability of more entities
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
particularly those serving again the
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
lowest income granted stators to compete
 
01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
for that funding and to make it
 
01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
therefore more inclusive so I don't
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
imagine there would be any increase in
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
in state obligations here it would again
 
01:47:14.209 --> 01:47:14.219 align:start position:0%
simply make the program more competitive
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
as well as more inclusive of the lowest
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
income folks
 
01:47:19.619 --> 01:47:20.629 align:start position:0%
income folks
um

01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
I'll just conclude in saying that again
 
01:47:27.290 --> 01:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
these programs set very exciting
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
potential to do what I believe all
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
parties intend making solar more
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
accessible to folks and with modest
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
fixes I am hopeful that particularly
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
these types of projects which tend to be
 
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
inherently more expensive putting solar
 
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
on smaller rooftops often older roofs
 
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
which may need to be replaced which may
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
need structural reinforcements that is
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
challenging and that's part of the
 
01:47:55.129 --> 01:47:55.139 align:start position:0%
reason why only a fraction of the total
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
solar installed directly serves low
 
01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
income folks this bill will help again
 
01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.219 align:start position:0%
expand who can benefit so thank you very
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
much happy to take any questions
 
01:48:06.290 --> 01:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and giving us
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
the industry perspective is there any
 
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.179 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr weeks
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has one
 
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Dan
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
for being here today again
 
01:48:20.770 --> 01:48:20.780 align:start position:0%
um would you characterize this
 
01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
legislation this bill as finally
 
01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:29.090 align:start position:0%
legislation this bill as finally
aligning

01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
aligning
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
the intent of the policy to direct solar
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
the benefits of solar to those who could
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
most benefit from it with the rules of
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
of implementation of the program
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reynolds I
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
think that's right
 
01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
um I recall in the deliberations around
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
SB 165 I think it was three years ago
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
creating the Illinois programs that
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
there was a clear intent from leaders on
 
01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
both sides to achieve this end and I
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
think it was an unintended consequence
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
of the way in which
 
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
residential end user customer was
 
01:49:09.649 --> 01:49:09.659 align:start position:0%
interpreted we were involved in detailed
 
01:49:10.729 --> 01:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Department of
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
energy around exactly what that meant
 
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
and it was I think not intended by
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
anybody that that would exclude these
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
lowest income folks who are indeed
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
energy customers of the utilities it
 
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.219 align:start position:0%
just happens that the bills are not in
 
01:49:25.209 --> 01:49:25.219 align:start position:0%
their name they're in the name of the
 
01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
public housing authority
 
01:49:30.649 --> 01:49:30.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:32.689 --> 01:49:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:36.179 align:start position:0%
weeks for being here thanks to your
 
01:49:36.179 --> 01:49:37.970 align:start position:0%
weeks for being here thanks to your
sidekick

01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
sidekick
 
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
this is a question that's been asked
 
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:41.699 align:start position:0%
previous uh testifiers and maybe your
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
your business has an idea of how many
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
additional uh project applicants could
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
possibly come out of this at legislation
 
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
beyond the 20 public housing authorities
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
that we know about
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kaplan
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
I think it as has been stated previously
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
it is the public housing authorities who
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
would be most directly affected by this
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
and would therefore be able to compete
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
in a way they have not today
 
01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
I have not done a detailed assessment of
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
all the low-income housing in the state
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
to know whether there's only a small or
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
more significant amount of other
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
affordable housing developments in which
 
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
electric bills are paid centrally by the
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
provider of housing as opposed to by the
 
01:50:30.169 --> 01:50:30.179 align:start position:0%
end user customers I believe it is
 
01:50:33.169 --> 01:50:33.179 align:start position:0%
pretty unique to to these public housing
 
01:50:33.179 --> 01:50:34.370 align:start position:0%
pretty unique to to these public housing
authorities

01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
and again I would just reiterate that
 
01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:38.699 align:start position:0%
this bill does not affect the funding
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
levels it simply affects who can compete
 
01:50:43.850 --> 01:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
for those available funds and I think
 
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
helps us to avoid a situation as was
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned last year where multiple
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
applications were submitted but none
 
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
were deemed eligible and so for an
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
entire year none of these low-income
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
01:51:03.169 --> 01:51:03.179 align:start position:0%
the committee I want to thank you for
 
01:51:04.850 --> 01:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
being here and I'm going to close the
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
now we will open a public hearing on
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 166 and I'll call Senator
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
David Waters the prime sponsor of this
 
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
legislation to introduce it to US
 
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
senator Waters
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
and I would remind anybody who wants to
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill to submit a pink
 
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
good morning again and thank you Mr
 
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee
 
01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters District 4 to
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 166 relative to
 
01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
grid modernization and I I just want to
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank the doe the utilities
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
um lots of folks here and in the Senate
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
who have helped work on this bill I
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
think because we have a shared
 
01:51:51.649 --> 01:51:51.659 align:start position:0%
recognition that we really do have to
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
move forward on grid modernization and
 
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
while the bill may not be perfect may
 
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
not cover everything I think we have a
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
pretty good framework here for for your
 
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
consideration and perhaps an improvement
 
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to say just a few things
 
01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
about you know what grid modernization
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
is about and what what it can do and
 
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
then I'll get into the details of the
 
01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:12.470 align:start position:0%
then I'll get into the details of the
bill

01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
um I think first and foremost we need to
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
modernize the grid to increase
 
01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.450 align:start position:0%
modernize the grid to increase
competition

01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
competition
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh it'll get a free market mechanisms
 
01:52:21.970 --> 01:52:21.980 align:start position:0%
into energy
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
also it is going to help provide for a
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
more stable and reliable grid because
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
we're going to manage uh demand and the
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
resources available to us much much
 
01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.350 align:start position:0%
resources available to us much much
better

01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I think also New Hampshire has a
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
great potential for grid modernization
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
and for it to be a tool to help us lower
 
01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:43.100 align:start position:0%
energy car costs and to introduce Market
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
based pricing
 
01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
um I think also we need to get our grid
 
01:52:52.729 --> 01:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
ready for the kinds of projects that are
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike it's not just the
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
the solar and other things but um you
 
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
know we're looking at offshore wind uh
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
the auctions are next summer which is
 
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
like tomorrow in terms of that industry
 
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
about 3.2 gigawatts are going to be
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
developed out in the Gulf of Maine we've
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
got to onshore that power and make sure
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
it gets at a low cost to our um
 
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
communities and
 
01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
um this is why is oh New England has
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
Dean grid modernization as necessary
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
throughout the states
 
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
um both to improve efficiency but also
 
01:53:25.930 --> 01:53:25.940 align:start position:0%
to combat higher
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
prices and then also
 
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
you know I will get to the 10-year
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
energy plan and other plans uh put
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
forward by the department of energy
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
where they identify good modernizations
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
one of the really important things in
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh can do to get
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
market-based um reforms and lower the
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
cost of energy I'll say additionally too
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the six New England Governors
 
01:53:48.649 --> 01:53:48.659 align:start position:0%
including obviously Governor sununu were
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
in a meeting with uh Isa New England and
 
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
folks and uh are we're discussing I had
 
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
a presentation about doing a the New
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
England states Governor's endorsing a
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
plan to come together to work on grid
 
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
modernization as a as a group and um
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see a little bit about that in
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
167 but I think that's a something that
 
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
New England Governors are recognizing
 
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
that this is something that all the
 
01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
states need to do and can do it perhaps
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
more cheaply
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
um together so the bill um it it it it
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
tries to introduce market-based uh
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
improvements and you'll see a lot in the
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
bill on that uh this is meant to um you
 
01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
know provide improvements in pricing to
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
increase resources and competition
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh it's also designed to lower energy
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
costs through a variety of means of grid
 
01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:39.250 align:start position:0%
costs through a variety of means of grid
modernization

01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:39.260 align:start position:0%
modernization
 
01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
it also helps us in the state to
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
establish the technical expertise we're
 
01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:48.659 align:start position:0%
going to need in the doe and for the puc
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
um and I think those those goals you'll
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
see here as well so if we could turn to
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
the first page the bill um the findings
 
01:54:55.850 --> 01:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
in some ways lays out what I've just
 
01:54:58.010 --> 01:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
described especially starting on line
 
01:54:58.020 --> 01:54:59.330 align:start position:0%
described especially starting on line
eight

01:54:59.330 --> 01:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
um the 10-year energy strategy looking
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
for market-based mechanisms for
 
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
achieving costs of effective energy
 
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
and the statement on lines 1011 here
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
from that energy plan the New Hampshire
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
should seek the Foster environment where
 
01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:15.050 align:start position:0%
should seek the Foster environment where
new

01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
and emerging Technologies can flourish
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
by the value they may bring to the
 
01:55:22.729 --> 01:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
market and to encourage Market selection
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
of cost-effective energy resources so
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
that really is what a lot of this bill
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
is about and it does it through a few a
 
01:55:30.649 --> 01:55:30.659 align:start position:0%
few things it does it through
 
01:55:32.890 --> 01:55:32.900 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
distributor generation distributed
 
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
storage and these methods can help
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
reduce and stabilize costs for uh rate
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
rate payers and in a sense this also
 
01:55:48.890 --> 01:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
goes all the way back to the 1990s when
 
01:55:51.890 --> 01:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
we did the restructuring under 374 and
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
one of the goals of 374 in 1996 was to
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get to the point where
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
we have a competitive markets and I hope
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
this bill can move us forward
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
um towards that I'd like to turn if I
 
01:56:05.159 --> 01:56:05.930 align:start position:0%
um towards that I'd like to turn if I
could

01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
um page three of the bill now Mr
 
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:08.450 align:start position:0%
um page three of the bill now Mr
chairman

01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
and um here's where you get the
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
definitions which lay out the bigger
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
picture items that I have been
 
01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.410 align:start position:0%
picture items that I have been
mentioning

01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
mentioning
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and so I think we learned
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
particularly this winner about demand
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
response that if we end up in the
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
situation where we have uh very high
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
demand and pushing up Energy prices to
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
astronomical levels can we have methods
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
to manage demand response and so that's
 
01:56:41.950 --> 01:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
part of what a modernized grid
 
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
um then also uh it has some definitions
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
to look at distributive storage I think
 
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:51.050 align:start position:0%
to look at distributive storage I think
storage

01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
storage
 
01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
is going to be an increasing component
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
of grid modernization and demand
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
response management do note if you would
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
on lines 23 following that I'm trying to
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
accomplish here uh an integration of of
 
01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
grid elect integrated electric vehicle
 
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
the car companies are bringing these
 
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
forward where there's software package
 
01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
within the car so that you can charge
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
you can charge up the battery but the
 
01:57:19.129 --> 01:57:19.139 align:start position:0%
utilities could also pull the power out
 
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
to help deal with spikes and uh if I
 
01:57:25.970 --> 01:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
think rather conservative projection
 
01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have about 60 000
 
01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
electric cars in the state by 2030
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
um that this this if you aggregate all
 
01:57:35.810 --> 01:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
those batteries that can really do
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
something for us to have a big storage
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
system that can help us deal with price
 
01:57:44.209 --> 01:57:44.219 align:start position:0%
bucks you may have noticed in the energy
 
01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
crisis we had this winter with the cold
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
temperatures that uh some places where
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
parking electric bus school buses out in
 
01:57:56.089 --> 01:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
front of emergency medical facilities to
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
provide them with the power that they
 
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
need and we are we have grants in place
 
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
and we are going to be getting some
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
electric buses in the state so this is a
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
capacity there and I think we had to
 
01:58:06.770 --> 01:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
kind of update some places in statute to
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that this new kind of capacity
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
gets included in Grid modernization
 
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of where the rubber hits the road
 
01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
on this bill starts at the bottom of
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
page three
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
um with the metering and you'll see in
 
01:58:22.129 --> 01:58:22.139 align:start position:0%
this section here and onto the top of
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
the next page it gets that kind of two
 
01:58:26.810 --> 01:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
things what kind of metering do we need
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
to have so this can get done so we can
 
01:58:30.410 --> 01:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
get accurate price signals added
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
intervals that are small enough so that
 
01:58:34.729 --> 01:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
people can understand how to you know
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
how to enter a competitive market with
 
01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
the power that they are they are
 
01:58:42.169 --> 01:58:42.179 align:start position:0%
producing had a lot of discussion with
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
utilities about the Amis the new
 
01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
metering they cost something
 
01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
there's concerns about how how these
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
would be rolled out whether it be pilot
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
programs or whatever but everybody
 
01:58:55.729 --> 01:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
recognizes that we've got to get to this
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
Advanced metering
 
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
not only so the utilities know right
 
01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
what power is being supplied and how
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's being metered but then can that
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
information as you'll see in the bottom
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
of this page can that information be
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
provided to the local the ders that
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
generators so that they understand they
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
have the price signal to know when to
 
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
put Power into the market uh when to
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
when to take it out
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
then on the top of page four it gets the
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
other side of that okay well how do we
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
deal with in Grid modernization the
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
potential sources that are going to help
 
01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
us do this and so that's why
 
01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
5678 we get into the various sources
 
01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
storage and then interconnection issues
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
so I know those are kind of technical
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
things but you see how the bill the bill
 
01:59:46.970 --> 01:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
kind of builds the principles and then
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
here are the technical errors that need
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
to be addressed if I may Mr chairman
 
01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to page um two
 
01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
and uh the establishment of a grid
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
modernization Advisory Group
 
02:00:02.649 --> 02:00:02.659 align:start position:0%
the bill takes the strategy of
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there's some real work
 
02:00:07.250 --> 02:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
to be done on some of the technical
 
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
issues that I have described and so we
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
need a group to work on that because at
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
this point in time it's not really clear
 
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
just exactly what to do in statute
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
so it was very very useful to have this
 
02:00:22.729 --> 02:00:22.739 align:start position:0%
group have certain duties and to be able
 
02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
to work on certain things that everybody
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
agrees who were on this group need to be
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
worked on and they should do it together
 
02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:31.139 align:start position:0%
then the other parts of the bill are
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
some things that we think could be done
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
now and I'll get to those in a moment
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
but the screen Advisory Group you'll see
 
02:00:40.609 --> 02:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
who's on it
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and you know all these folks have
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
been contacted and seemed appropriate
 
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
through discussions with doe and others
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
that these are the ones who ought to be
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
there working on um
 
02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
these issues and uh then you've got the
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
duties starting on line 19.
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
um you know just to make sure under the
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
original 1996 uh restructuring
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
organization under the 374 F2 that the
 
02:01:06.169 --> 02:01:06.179 align:start position:0%
principles of grid modernization are
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
following from those statutory
 
02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:10.310 align:start position:0%
following from those statutory
requirements

02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
um to look at what we need to do about
 
02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
transactive energy and advanced metering
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure because that's something
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a challenge for
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
utilities but we've got to figure out a
 
02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
way to do that some other states are
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
taking their approaches let's take a
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
look at what's going to work for New
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how to do the settlement or
 
02:01:30.410 --> 02:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
Price signals that it'll work in a
 
02:01:33.290 --> 02:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
modernized grid and then
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
um how is it have an appropriate system
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
where customer and distributed energy
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
resources have access to temporal price
 
02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
signals so they can get into this
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
competitive market
 
02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
and then one I think particularly
 
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
important issue starting on line 28
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
um interconnection interconnection and
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue for being
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
able to bring new resources onto the
 
02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:57.310 align:start position:0%
able to bring new resources onto the
grid

02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
grid
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
you may have heard from your districts
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
concerns about internet connection costs
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
um Dover I'll give you one example they
 
02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:09.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to build a solar project out at
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
the County Farm
 
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
and that would help you know reduce
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
costs greatly for city of Dover and for
 
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
the County Farm Complex as well
 
02:02:19.729 --> 02:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
so the nearest interconnection point is
 
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
over in Madbury
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
about a mile and a half away and so they
 
02:02:25.850 --> 02:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
get a price to be a couple million
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
dollars for the interconnection
 
02:02:29.450 --> 02:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
now that suddenly changes the numbers
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
here for the price of the project and
 
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
for the investors who are interested in
 
02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:34.310 align:start position:0%
for the investors who are interested in
it

02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the problem that comes from that too
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
is that okay so the first person the
 
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
first person to come forward pays the
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
whole Freight
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
but then there might be five or six
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
other projects that come in behind it
 
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't we look at a mechanism
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
whereby those subsequent folks could
 
02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:53.990 align:start position:0%
whereby those subsequent folks could
help

02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
offset or return some of the costs the
 
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
original investor the model I put
 
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
together here that the committee would
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
is what I'd worked on with Senator
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
boutin uh when we had the same issue
 
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
around mall development or commercial
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
industrial property development that if
 
02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
the first person came in and paid for
 
02:03:15.169 --> 02:03:15.179 align:start position:0%
you know the water sewer and
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and then they built their
 
02:03:19.129 --> 02:03:19.139 align:start position:0%
Factory or their you know or their
 
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
commercial building and then five or six
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
other people come in so shouldn't they
 
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
be able to get some of their original
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
investment back and you know so Senator
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
boat and I did that with that and I
 
02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
thought well that's the model we ought
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's why there's an actual a
 
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
little bit of a hurry update Say by
 
02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
September 1st 2024 let us know
 
02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
um you know what the utilities and
 
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
others think can work on this and we got
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
pretty far down the road actually trying
 
02:03:45.649 --> 02:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
to develop a mechanism where that could
 
02:03:47.089 --> 02:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
work and put it in the Statue but didn't
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
quite get there so that that one is uh
 
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
going to help there bottom of the page
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
two um this is something that's come up
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit on grid modernization that
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
we need some technical expertise there
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
was some discussion about whether to put
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
um the Consulting for this in the Office
 
02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
of Consumer Advocate it was thought no
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's better to put it in the department
 
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:10.139 align:start position:0%
um and that is a recoverable cost so
 
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
there's no physical note on that
 
02:04:13.490 --> 02:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I think you're going to hear from
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that they think
 
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a little a little
 
02:04:18.169 --> 02:04:18.179 align:start position:0%
tweak here about how that consultant
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
gets paid um but that's that's why that
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
is there and it's very clear we need
 
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
this technical expertise going
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh go going forward
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
um so let's turn if we could then
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
towards the end of the bill on page four
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
and here's where uh
 
02:04:37.250 --> 02:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
we get into some things that we thought
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
could be done now
 
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:40.850 align:start position:0%
could be done now
um

02:04:40.850 --> 02:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:44.330 --> 02:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
so uh I mentioned the interconnection so
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
here's on the middle of page four to put
 
02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
in statute that the interconnection
 
02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
requirements that group is going to work
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
on should be consistent with what we've
 
02:04:56.450 --> 02:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
already said about that under 378
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
um 37 under our policy that
 
02:05:00.169 --> 02:05:00.179 align:start position:0%
interconnection standards are something
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
that needs to be accomplished then
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see a little bit before there's a
 
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
couple of places here where we in our
 
02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
definition of storage in the next couple
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
Pages we get those grid integrated
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles included in a
 
02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
definition so technically that can work
 
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:17.629 align:start position:0%
definition so technically that can work
out

02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
um then um you're going to hear a lot
 
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
more about this from doe and from
 
02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
um Cliff below but both of them again I
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
want to thank for their help on this
 
02:05:27.659 --> 02:05:28.729 align:start position:0%
want to thank for their help on this
bill

02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
um what about the pilot projects now
 
02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
we've approved some of these uh and
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from the folks who are
 
02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
developing them that we didn't quite get
 
02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
it right in terms of the size of these
 
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't so you're going to hear
 
02:05:44.810 --> 02:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
about some potential adjustments here
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
um doe has some new ideas about it Cliff
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
Bo has some ideas I know there's a lot
 
02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
of expertise on this committee and I
 
02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
think that we probably do to do need to
 
02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
make some adjustments here but I think
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
it's something you're going to be
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
clearly working on about how many of
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
these pilots and what size they are and
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
why we might need to um
 
02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
pay some attention to it and do note on
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
page five that um because there are
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
um there's there is some something
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
before the puc that just want to
 
02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they are going to have
 
02:06:21.290 --> 02:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
some guidance in so that whatever is
 
02:06:23.629 --> 02:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
proposed here about these Pilots will be
 
02:06:25.729 --> 02:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the guidance the POC
 
02:06:25.739 --> 02:06:26.930 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the guidance the POC
is

02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
um is is bringing forward
 
02:06:33.649 --> 02:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
um I think the rest of it is largely
 
02:06:36.649 --> 02:06:36.659 align:start position:0%
um technical I do want to mention at the
 
02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
very end here
 
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
um lines 23 to 27 working with the
 
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
Mark Sanborn you know after that meeting
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the governors
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
um where they said yeah we've got to
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
work together on um uh on grid for
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
offshore wind so I we thought that it
 
02:06:59.089 --> 02:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
would be um useful to put into statute
 
02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
what we what we do in the office of
 
02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
offshore wind is to take on this
 
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility of working with the other
 
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
states and working with the Bureau of
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
ocean Energy Management on these plants
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
we need a place in the government where
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
these plans get centralized and worked
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
on so that our governor can participate
 
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
with the other other states uh
 
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
um there so that that's why this is uh
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
was added on into the bill because it
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
seemed like a convenient place to to do
 
02:07:31.490 --> 02:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
that and there is some funding in the
 
02:07:32.930 --> 02:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
budget as I understand that came out of
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
the house that helps this office out a
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
bit so I will
 
02:07:38.930 --> 02:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
stop there Mr chairman and after this
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
little blizzard of details and we got to
 
02:07:43.010 --> 02:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
well thank you that was a blizzard
 
02:07:48.169 --> 02:07:48.179 align:start position:0%
I suppose water should say it was a
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
flood but whatever
 
02:07:52.490 --> 02:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will be able to endure it
 
02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will be able to endure it
all

02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
I do have one question at the risk of
 
02:07:59.149 --> 02:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
stealing the Thunder of Representative
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas
 
02:08:03.890 --> 02:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
02:08:06.169 --> 02:08:06.179 align:start position:0%
attached to this bill basically says
 
02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
nothing could you explain to us how
 
02:08:11.689 --> 02:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes work in the Senate are they
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
different from how they work in the
 
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
house where would we find the fiscal
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
note for example have you looked at it
 
02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
note for example have you looked at it
Etc

02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
um it's done just the same way it's done
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the house
 
02:08:25.490 --> 02:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
um exactly the same way and uh I think
 
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
that the way this this bill it was
 
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
amended quite a bit so I think that it
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
was difficult as always for the
 
02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
um for the budget office to kind of
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
catch up with it but as I look at this
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure except for the um the
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
little piece about the offshore wind
 
02:08:44.639 --> 02:08:46.910 align:start position:0%
little piece about the offshore wind
office

02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:08:49.129 --> 02:08:49.139 align:start position:0%
um which is covered in the budget
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's no appropriation here just says
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's their responsibility paying for
 
02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
it is is in the budget
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and then um the other potential cost
 
02:09:00.890 --> 02:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
is for that consultant
 
02:09:03.770 --> 02:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
but that's a recoverable cost the DOA
 
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
has that authority to do that as it's
 
02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
outlined here
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
so the group is going to get together so
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know I mean is there cost to the
 
02:09:14.330 --> 02:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
group getting together I you know but
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'm not I'm not entirely sure
 
02:09:19.070 --> 02:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
that there is much of a physical impact
 
02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
um that's that is attributed to any of
 
02:09:25.850 --> 02:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
the kind of particular things in here
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:09:30.410 --> 02:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
since you mentioned the Advisory Group
 
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
and how it's going to get to itself
 
02:09:36.050 --> 02:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
together it's so on and so forth
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like you to speak a little bit more
 
02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
about why an Advisory Group is needed I
 
02:09:43.490 --> 02:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
mean the department of energy
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
must have staff and of course I'll ask
 
02:09:48.169 --> 02:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
them this question when they testify but
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
they must have resources that they can
 
02:09:51.609 --> 02:09:51.619 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
02:09:51.619 --> 02:09:53.570 align:start position:0%
apply to
determining

02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
determining
 
02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
grid modernization needs
 
02:09:59.450 --> 02:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
why do they need an Advisory Group and
 
02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this Advisory Group because
 
02:10:05.209 --> 02:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
it's comprised of a bunch of people who
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
have other jobs
 
02:10:09.169 --> 02:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
have difficulty getting together and
 
02:10:11.709 --> 02:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
meeting and coming up with concrete
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the Department well
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for the questions and I mean it
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
really is is kind of in two parts and I
 
02:10:20.450 --> 02:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
think the first part is that
 
02:10:22.250 --> 02:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
I think the department of energy will
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
tell you that the the capacity for
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
looking at all these areas is perhaps
 
02:10:29.570 --> 02:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
best served by having the folks who you
 
02:10:31.129 --> 02:10:31.139 align:start position:0%
know as boots are on the ground I mean
 
02:10:32.649 --> 02:10:32.659 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to talk about
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
metering and you want to talk about
 
02:10:38.209 --> 02:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
um interconnection points and so forth
 
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
having the utilities that are facing
 
02:10:42.169 --> 02:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
that and then the folks who are trying
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
to get such things done at the table
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
with you is a lot more probably the best
 
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
way to go and the folks a lot of
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
discussion around this a lot of
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
discussion with the department and with
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
these these participants who are saying
 
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
we we think this is the best way to get
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
it done there's a lot of issues here but
 
02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
we can get together and we can we can
 
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
work through them as as a group and I
 
02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
think it makes some I think it makes
 
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
some sense you know sometimes we set up
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislative commissions which have these
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
kinds of people on it but then we have
 
02:11:14.089 --> 02:11:14.099 align:start position:0%
to have you know a whole lot of
 
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
legislators now and I thought that you
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
know yes Mr chairman it is their job to
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
do these kinds of things but I think
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
that through a partnership through a
 
02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
working group like this that can be
 
02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:26.870 align:start position:0%
working group like this that can be
there

02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you know as new issues emerge and can
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
and can kind of work work with work with
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
each other that that that and they're
 
02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to have the expertise of that kind
 
02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:37.490 align:start position:0%
going to have the expertise of that kind
consultant

02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
that is in here too and that that's kind
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
of a key to helping make this this work
 
02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
for everybody involved
 
02:11:46.129 --> 02:11:46.139 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you additional
 
02:11:48.169 --> 02:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
questions representative Doug Thomas has
 
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:11:51.290 --> 02:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:11:54.669 --> 02:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
um uh realizing that your emphasis was
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
now all right but I my question involves
 
02:11:59.930 --> 02:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
the fact that you in your in your
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
dissertation you you mentioned the term
 
02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
clean energy it does not appear in this
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
in this bill here but um then I read
 
02:12:12.410 --> 02:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
down on page three on the grid
 
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
modernization line 27 uh what you what
 
02:12:17.089 --> 02:12:17.099 align:start position:0%
you talk about what grid modernization
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
means my question is realizing that the
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
time is not now but sometime in the
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
future uh not too distant future
 
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
does this bill would this bill and this
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
definition here also apply eventually to
 
02:12:38.209 --> 02:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
small-scale nuclear energy is this can
 
02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
this be applied the same way and mean
 
02:12:43.490 --> 02:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
the same way and and and and and if so
 
02:12:46.609 --> 02:12:46.619 align:start position:0%
uh is there room somewhere in this bill
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
there where that could be mentioned at
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
um yes and I thank you for mentioning
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
that because I I think that is just a
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
crucial inclusion because that is that's
 
02:13:02.689 --> 02:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
in that potentially can be an important
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh part of future reliable energy
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
um sources and um
 
02:13:12.649 --> 02:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
I think that uh it might be useful I
 
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
mean I have in that that working group
 
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know and other issues and other
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
sources and I think if I think that
 
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
could be explicitly put in and that
 
02:13:21.050 --> 02:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
um quite helpful to have there because I
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
do think that the grid modernization
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
definition certainly incorporates these
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of new technologies I mean that's
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
why the findings new technologies new
 
02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
technologies we've gotta we've got to be
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
aware of them and understand what good
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
modernization and particularly what kind
 
02:13:40.850 --> 02:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
of advanced metering
 
02:13:43.129 --> 02:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of this bill is what can
 
02:13:46.609 --> 02:13:46.619 align:start position:0%
help us avoid the kind of demand spikes
 
02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
so that we're not seeing our costs
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
escalate in the state and then also how
 
02:13:54.890 --> 02:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
is it that we can make sure that folks
 
02:13:57.050 --> 02:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
who want to bring these new sources can
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
get the appropriate price signals so
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
they can be a competitive market there
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
which will lower cost so yes oh yeah all
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
right thank you so so any should any
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment come as a result of this bill
 
02:14:13.250 --> 02:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
here uh you'd be amenable to that idea
 
02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
being added as well thanks sir I would
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
say that you could you could um you know
 
02:14:19.370 --> 02:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
have include you know under the
 
02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
definition here of good modernization
 
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
say inclusive of
 
02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
and I think also under that working
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
group that I think it's kind of
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
implicitly that anything comes along you
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
got to talk about it but if you want to
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
make it a little more explicit that you
 
02:14:35.689 --> 02:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
want to mention mention that kind of as
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
a placeholder
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.990 --> 02:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
let's keep the Thomas train running and
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
call on representative Wendy Thomas
 
02:14:49.490 --> 02:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and thank you senator for being here
 
02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
um with regard to The Advisory Group
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
I've noticed there's no representative
 
02:14:58.490 --> 02:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
from the house or the Senate um however
 
02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
they do do an annual report that is
 
02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
presented to the house and the Senate
 
02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with having no
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
participant involved well um thanks for
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
your question but let us let me remind
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
the committee that we passed the bill
 
02:15:16.430 --> 02:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
last year that says that any commission
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
or committee that's set up with
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
legislators has to have a majority of
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
legislators so do the math and
 
02:15:25.370 --> 02:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
commentary people on this thing and
 
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to load it up with
 
02:15:28.850 --> 02:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
the legislators who every two years May
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
or not be here so that's why I
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
structured into it the the group and the
 
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
reporting so so follow up follow up so
 
02:15:39.649 --> 02:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
um so that's the definition of Advisory
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
Group as opposed to commission okay
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I mean advisor group is
 
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to make it into it
 
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
just that the important thing it's not a
 
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a commission because then that
 
02:15:52.510 --> 02:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
provision of Statute kicks in
 
02:15:55.609 --> 02:15:55.619 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a question
 
02:15:57.290 --> 02:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
02:15:58.970 --> 02:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
question um I also have a question
 
02:16:00.649 --> 02:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
02:16:00.659 --> 02:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
related to the
um

02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
advisory committee so it seems like it's
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
very focused on
 
02:16:08.330 --> 02:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know right now the issues that we're
 
02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
facing and kind of needing to create a
 
02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
transformation in our Energy System
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
um but there's no sort of like
 
02:16:16.129 --> 02:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
expiration date on the committee do you
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
foresee this you know continuing and the
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
grid really continuing to evolve
 
02:16:24.169 --> 02:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
substantially or um
 
02:16:26.330 --> 02:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question you know
 
02:16:27.649 --> 02:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
and don't don't you think we're going to
 
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
need this I mean I I just think about
 
02:16:32.570 --> 02:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
the last few years I mean who who would
 
02:16:34.849 --> 02:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
have thought of offshore wind right who
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
would have thought of really commercial
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
viable solar I mean my goodness 10 years
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
ago the panels are so expensive right
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and in electric vehicles you know and
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
and the and the capacity as well to have
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
grinted grid integration where these
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
these flows can go both ways and and
 
02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
storage who thought of electrical
 
02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
storage you know we had a battery in
 
02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
your car that was your electrical
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
storage right so um I am sure and as
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas mentioned there
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
there are going to be news sources and
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
then the technology in these in these
 
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
areas are developing very fast about
 
02:17:10.969 --> 02:17:10.979 align:start position:0%
what we can do on on metering and
 
02:17:13.129 --> 02:17:13.139 align:start position:0%
distributing distributed energy
 
02:17:15.169 --> 02:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
resources so I I think there's gonna be
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
work to do
 
02:17:19.009 --> 02:17:19.019 align:start position:0%
um for this and and I I to say
 
02:17:19.019 --> 02:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
um for this and and I I to say
personally

02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
personally
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
my feelings about this I want to I want
 
02:17:23.929 --> 02:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be competitive I want
 
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
low energy costs right and I I think I
 
02:17:28.969 --> 02:17:28.979 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we are ready
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
to be nimble and can have in statute the
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of tools that are needed so we can
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know not be at the mercy of energy
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
spikes and foreign energy sources and
 
02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
all that and I think I think grid
 
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
modernization is is gonna you know get
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
get us back in charge of our of our
 
02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
energy in a way that's going to save
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question It just
 
02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
strikes me as a as a program manager
 
02:18:04.969 --> 02:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
myself that this is a great way to get
 
02:18:04.979 --> 02:18:05.870 align:start position:0%
myself that this is a great way to get
at

02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't have a plan that
 
02:18:08.929 --> 02:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
we're following but we know that grid
 
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
modernization is something that we have
 
02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
to understand and so our tendency has
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
been to
 
02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
um put up bills that we think are good
 
02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know Target these things
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
individually uh and try and see if we
 
02:18:24.290 --> 02:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
can move those individual bills but not
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
in an overall context for what we're
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
doing and I think I like this bill
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
um building blocks if you will that have
 
02:18:37.849 --> 02:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
to be considered so that there is there
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
a question here having the conversation
 
02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
so yeah there is
 
02:18:46.009 --> 02:18:46.019 align:start position:0%
um so my question is uh
 
02:18:48.530 --> 02:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
do you see this taking the place of all
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
of those uh individual efforts and I'll
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
give you a specific example we had an uh
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
an EV bill that we I'm sorry smart meter
 
02:18:58.849 --> 02:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
bill that went through our committee
 
02:19:01.389 --> 02:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
this year trying to get at
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
whether we could have optional meters
 
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
available through the utilities so
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
people could start helping to convert a
 
02:19:11.089 --> 02:19:11.099 align:start position:0%
system that might be expensive to do as
 
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
a mandate so we we are I think
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
biting at the heels of the things in
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
this bill but this bill gives us a
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
framework so
 
02:19:22.730 --> 02:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
um can you just speak to whether that's
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
the goal of the bill uh is to set us on
 
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
a framework where we actually have some
 
02:19:29.169 --> 02:19:29.179 align:start position:0%
answers to these questions
 
02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:32.519 align:start position:0%
thank you and um I think that really
 
02:19:34.429 --> 02:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
what it I hope it does is set up a
 
02:19:36.169 --> 02:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
process that we can get to something or
 
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
work for New Hampshire the example you
 
02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:39.410 align:start position:0%
work for New Hampshire the example you
mentioned

02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:19:41.450 --> 02:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
I worked a lot on that potentially in
 
02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
here and then realized that I don't
 
02:19:45.650 --> 02:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
think it's possible yet to make a plan
 
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire to have the utilities
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
be able to move forward on the the Ami
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of reasons for that
 
02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
part of its costs if you go down to
 
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the utilities are getting
 
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
about 100 million dollars from the state
 
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
to do the the metering well we're not
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
doing that we're not gonna
 
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
so what can work for New Hampshire and
 
02:20:06.889 --> 02:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
um I think everybody knows we've got to
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
do it right utilities say yeah we've got
 
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
to do it but we've got to find out a way
 
02:20:13.130 --> 02:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
that will work for us and I and I think
 
02:20:14.690 --> 02:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
that there are many things like that
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we have been beating our heads
 
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
against and trying to take little pieces
 
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
of it and get it done and I I just think
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
that well what you have when you have
 
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
problems like that you get people
 
02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
together you work with utilities and the
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
doe and the puc and figure out what can
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
work for New Hampshire so I think
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity there then you
 
02:20:33.290 --> 02:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
know rather than end up with piecemeal
 
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
or frustration to to have a rational
 
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
plan that can emerge from this group
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
that we legislators can then figure out
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
how to how to make into policy in Mr
 
02:20:43.969 --> 02:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
chair I have one more follow-up
 
02:20:43.979 --> 02:20:45.770 align:start position:0%
chair I have one more follow-up
follow-up

02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:20:49.250 --> 02:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
um in section three on page one uh you
 
02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
had referred to several points for
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
um that came out of the 10-year energy
 
02:20:56.570 --> 02:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
strategy the state energy strategy but
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
one of the ones that you
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
stop short on which I would like you to
 
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
comment on would be on line 13 goal
 
02:21:05.809 --> 02:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
eight generate in-state economic
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
activity without Reliance on permanent
 
02:21:09.530 --> 02:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
long-term subsidization of energy we
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot of conversations on this uh
 
02:21:14.750 --> 02:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
committee about subsidies so could you
 
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
state specifically why that one's in
 
02:21:19.250 --> 02:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
there yeah thank you I think it's an
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
important principle yeah I mean I like
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
research and development I like startup
 
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
I like you know we we have traditionally
 
02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
provided all kinds of federal subsidies
 
02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
for certain kinds of energy sources and
 
02:21:31.969 --> 02:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I don't think there's any
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
appetite for permanent subsidies or for
 
02:21:36.889 --> 02:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
cost shifting or anything so this is I
 
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
think that's an important principle I
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
think it's a New Hampshire principle too
 
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
let me just mention one other thing too
 
02:21:43.849 --> 02:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
about about this well I think this bill
 
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
is Timely
 
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
um the IRA bill has 3.1 million dollars
 
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
for each state that applies to do an
 
02:21:52.849 --> 02:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
action plan
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
on energy and climate things and doesn't
 
02:21:57.290 --> 02:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
require you to any mandates or anything
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
like that it says you you can get 3.1
 
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars and uh we were you know
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
103600 ply we're applying now and uh
 
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward application
 
02:22:08.929 --> 02:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
we should get that money pretty soon uh
 
02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Sanborn is
 
02:22:12.889 --> 02:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
heading that up on the governor's behalf
 
02:22:15.170 --> 02:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have 3.1 million
 
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
dollars for for people to come in and
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
help us to do
 
02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
planning as well there's a little money
 
02:22:21.770 --> 02:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
in here too so I think we have a context
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
where we're going to have some real
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
oomph around figuring out
 
02:22:29.450 --> 02:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
just that you know what what can work
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and how do we get it
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
done for our system so I'm I'm very I'm
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
actually I'm very optimistic I think it
 
02:22:37.370 --> 02:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
was a good partnership now with the with
 
02:22:39.530 --> 02:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
the governor utilities all of us to to
 
02:22:41.330 --> 02:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
get at some of these big problems that
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've been you know we've been working
 
02:22:46.429 --> 02:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative muttons has a question
 
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Senator
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
again for being here
 
02:22:55.849 --> 02:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
um as as you as you know
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
um citing for major energy projects has
 
02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
been a challenge has been in it and
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
given that does it make sense to have
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question I think
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
we're gonna I I think appropriately we
 
02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
are going to be handling site
 
02:23:22.969 --> 02:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
sighting in the structures that we
 
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
already have and this really is is not
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
about citing per se it's about these
 
02:23:30.650 --> 02:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
grid issues and I'm not sure the Des
 
02:23:32.330 --> 02:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
would really want to see it at this
 
02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:34.849 align:start position:0%
would really want to see it at this
table

02:23:34.849 --> 02:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
02:23:40.730 --> 02:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
02:23:42.770 --> 02:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
um I just first want to Echo uh
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative McGee's commendations for
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
the you know the scope of this bill I
 
02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a it's going to be a
 
02:23:50.210 --> 02:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
great thing for the state to take on uh
 
02:23:52.849 --> 02:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
in in lieu of the at you know because of
 
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
the absence of an overall strategy that
 
02:23:57.770 --> 02:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
something like this is very useful uh my
 
02:24:00.530 --> 02:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
question is how does grid modernization
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
and transformative pricing signals Etc
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
how does that impact on our net metering
 
02:24:07.010 --> 02:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
program do you have an idea of how that
 
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
would work
 
02:24:10.969 --> 02:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question and I would
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
think that it potentially could make it
 
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
more efficient
 
02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
um because we will have
 
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know this doesn't address that in
 
02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:19.670 align:start position:0%
you know this doesn't address that in
directly

02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
um because that has its own regulatory
 
02:24:24.050 --> 02:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
framework but if we're looking at you
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
know how is it that we're going to have
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
distributive energy sources whether
 
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
under imaginary programs or not
 
02:24:31.490 --> 02:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
um how are we going to have them more
 
02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
effectively manage to help reduce costs
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
for all of us
 
02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if it's an answer to
 
02:24:40.490 --> 02:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
your question but that's you know this
 
02:24:42.530 --> 02:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
is not particularly directed towards
 
02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
that it's directed towards the kind of
 
02:24:47.210 --> 02:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
but you don't see it having an impact at
 
02:24:51.290 --> 02:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:53.570 --> 02:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I think that anything that helps them
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
improve the time increments and the
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
price signaling
 
02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
um especially as you think about
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
some of the net metering entities or the
 
02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:04.370 align:start position:0%
some of the net metering entities or the
um

02:25:04.370 --> 02:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:06.590 --> 02:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
Community power Coalition might start
 
02:25:08.690 --> 02:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
looking into storage
 
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh capacities as a way of dealing with
 
02:25:14.929 --> 02:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
demand response and so on it could be
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.359 --> 02:25:20.090 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:25:20.090 --> 02:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions for
 
02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters we'll move on now and
 
02:25:25.849 --> 02:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
02:25:27.650 --> 02:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
introducing the legislation we'll move
 
02:25:29.389 --> 02:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
on now to the Department of energy and
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge will give us the
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.610 --> 02:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh members of the
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
committee uh again Griffin Ro bush from
 
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy uh neutral to
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 166 as amended by the Senate
 
02:25:50.330 --> 02:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
um I think Senate Waters gave a good
 
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
overview as to what the Genesis of this
 
02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:55.490 align:start position:0%
bill is
um

02:25:55.490 --> 02:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
I think my testimony today I'm going to
 
02:25:58.910 --> 02:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
outline a few observations that the
 
02:26:00.889 --> 02:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
department has with uh has of the bill
 
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
but I do want to note immediately from
 
02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
the outset that we are still reviewing
 
02:26:07.610 --> 02:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
um the statutory changes outlined in
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
this bill and we may have additional
 
02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
observations as time goes on
 
02:26:13.610 --> 02:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
um what I'm what I have to offer today
 
02:26:15.230 --> 02:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
are just some initial observations again
 
02:26:18.349 --> 02:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's nowhere near final I would submit
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
um in section two of the bill as I
 
02:26:23.570 --> 02:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
believe Senator Waters mentioned uh the
 
02:26:25.730 --> 02:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two
 
02:26:27.730 --> 02:26:27.740 align:start position:0%
line 34
 
02:26:30.969 --> 02:26:30.979 align:start position:0%
to assist the grid modernization
 
02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
advisory committee the department May
 
02:26:35.090 --> 02:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
obtain the services of a consultant for
 
02:26:36.849 --> 02:26:36.859 align:start position:0%
technical support
 
02:26:39.050 --> 02:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
for Department of energy staff the
 
02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and the grid
 
02:26:43.370 --> 02:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
modernization Advisory Group it then
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that the department of
 
02:26:46.730 --> 02:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
energy shall charge a special assessment
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
for any such amounts for this consultant
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
against any utility participating in The
 
02:26:54.170 --> 02:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
Advisory Group and shall provide for the
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
timely recovery of such amounts for the
 
02:26:58.090 --> 02:26:58.100 align:start position:0%
affected utility
 
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
the department has uh you know I think
 
02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
respectfully can certainly charge
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
special assessment costs but it cannot
 
02:27:07.969 --> 02:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
recover those costs that is a duty of
 
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission if this
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
bill is to move forward we would suggest
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
inserting the Public Utilities
 
02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
Commission on page three
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
line one
 
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
between and and shall
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
so the puc I'm sorry the department
 
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
would be able to charge the special
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
assessment but the recovery of costs
 
02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
would come through uh the puc
 
02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:37.969 --> 02:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
um we did want to note some technical
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with the way that the bill is
 
02:27:41.809 --> 02:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
currently written if you look on page
 
02:27:44.809 --> 02:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
four line six
 
02:27:48.650 --> 02:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
it references RSA 378 colon 37 the New
 
02:27:51.230 --> 02:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy policy that statute
 
02:27:54.650 --> 02:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
was repealed under house bill 281 has
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
passed by this body should both bills
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
make their way into law there could
 
02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
potentially be a conflict so I want to
 
02:28:03.290 --> 02:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
flag that for the committee's
 
02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:04.510 align:start position:0%
flag that for the committee's
consideration

02:28:04.510 --> 02:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:28:08.809 --> 02:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
same concerns extend down to page four
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
line 20 again makes another reference to
 
02:28:13.809 --> 02:28:13.819 align:start position:0%
RSA 37
 
02:28:18.170 --> 02:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
378 colon 37 again that was repealed
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
under house bill 281. additionally with
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
our uh with section four the department
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
feels that that whole section would be
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
better removed outright the reason being
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
is that it makes reference to
 
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
interconnection requirements and
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
procedures the department does have an
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
open investigatory proceeding on uh
 
02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
interconnection standards per Senate
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 262 from last year we prefer to let
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
that process play out
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
um before making sizable changes such as
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
this in section four
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
um section six
 
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
um regarding pilot programs under the
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
Lipa statute
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
um this you may recall uh for those who
 
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
are around was passed with Senate Bill
 
02:29:05.929 --> 02:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
321 from last year that would create
 
02:29:09.290 --> 02:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
these Pilots under the Lepa statute the
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
department has uh some concerns with
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
page four line 29 where it eliminates
 
02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
the current language no more than one
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
pilot shall be permitted for any utility
 
02:29:22.849 --> 02:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
the department would submit that the
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of a pro of a pilot program is
 
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
to undertake an activity as a test or a
 
02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
trial to help understand how
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
it would be beneficial as the pr as the
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
as the program builds out
 
02:29:37.610 --> 02:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
um in our respectful opinion eliminating
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
that language does not it's no longer a
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
pilot anymore you can just have any
 
02:29:43.849 --> 02:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
number of projects you want up to the
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
proposed five megawatt cap we would uh
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to retain the
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
language on page four line 29
 
02:29:56.090 --> 02:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
um and if so that would also necessitate
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:01.969 --> 02:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
uh which is again further down on page
 
02:30:05.929 --> 02:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
four lines 35 and 36 that change could
 
02:30:08.809 --> 02:30:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.010 --> 02:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:16.849 --> 02:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
lines five to six uh five to seven
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
should be removed as well with a period
 
02:30:23.330 --> 02:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
right after resolved on line five I
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
realized that that was a lot of sorting
 
02:30:27.290 --> 02:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
through lines pages and everything like
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
that that really concludes the
 
02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
Department's immediate
 
02:30:33.050 --> 02:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
um observations with the bill I'm happy
 
02:30:34.730 --> 02:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
to take any questions but again as I
 
02:30:36.410 --> 02:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh still reviewing the bill in
 
02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.889 --> 02:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for uh your perspective
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee let's go to
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative cretian first
 
02:30:52.969 --> 02:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to follow up on that the
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
reasoning for
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
um basically keeping utilities
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited from participating in one or
 
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
more pilots wouldn't that
 
02:31:04.250 --> 02:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
I guess can't you imagine a situation
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
where a utility might want to try
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
different Technologies or or be
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
participating in Pilots for for sort of
 
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
different angles on this why would it
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
make sense to make them finish one
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
before starting another sure and thank
 
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
you for the question so as part of
 
02:31:20.570 --> 02:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 321 before these Pilots can
 
02:31:23.929 --> 02:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
it all be conducted under uh section six
 
02:31:26.330 --> 02:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh there is a major question of some
 
02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issues between State
 
02:31:31.429 --> 02:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction ISO uh jurisdiction that is
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be sorted out through a proceeding at
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission before
 
02:31:37.070 --> 02:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
any of these Pilots can take place
 
02:31:39.170 --> 02:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
following the resolution of those
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issues and whether or not
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
these Pilots could take place again the
 
02:31:45.170 --> 02:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
purpose of a pilot program is to engage
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the test trial to see how it would
 
02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:48.530 align:start position:0%
in the test trial to see how it would
work

02:31:48.530 --> 02:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:31:50.690 --> 02:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
um you know on a larger scale you see
 
02:31:52.730 --> 02:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
that in different proceedings before the
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
puc such as battery storage and that
 
02:31:55.849 --> 02:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
type of thing
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
um before even One Pilot pro project is
 
02:32:01.250 --> 02:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
being proposed we're already talking
 
02:32:03.770 --> 02:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
about removing the cap and allowing just
 
02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
and allowing just any amount of projects
 
02:32:09.290 --> 02:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
within a utility territory I think we
 
02:32:11.450 --> 02:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
would prefer to let the pilot play out
 
02:32:13.730 --> 02:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
first to see how it works and then
 
02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
should there be success in the
 
02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to amend that to you
 
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
know remove that language on the pilot
 
02:32:22.610 --> 02:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
the certain uh certainly legislation in
 
02:32:23.929 --> 02:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
the future can be brought forward to do
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
that but at this time again there are
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
many steps that should take place before
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
we reach that hurdle
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters mentioned that there
 
02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:38.450 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters mentioned that there
is

02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:38.990 align:start position:0%
is
um

02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
about 3.1 million dollars coming to the
 
02:32:44.210 --> 02:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
state through the IRA
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
um could that money be used to pay the
 
02:32:46.920 --> 02:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
um could that money be used to pay the
consultant

02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to recover it from
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
utilities and therefore the customers
 
02:32:54.770 --> 02:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you for the question um
 
02:32:56.570 --> 02:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's a good question it's not when I
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
have an answer to it's just because that
 
02:33:00.650 --> 02:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
is a funding opportunity coming down
 
02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
through an Environmental Protection
 
02:33:04.969 --> 02:33:04.979 align:start position:0%
Agency and Des I believe is the lead
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
Agency for applying for those funds so I
 
02:33:09.889 --> 02:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
respectfully I I just don't know I think
 
02:33:11.929 --> 02:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
Des would be a better person to ask
 
02:33:14.990 --> 02:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
02:33:19.010 --> 02:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
Roberts yes thank you uh regarding
 
02:33:23.630 --> 02:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
section four you recommended removing it
 
02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
because doe has an open proceeding yes
 
02:33:27.889 --> 02:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
can you speak more about that please
 
02:33:31.550 --> 02:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
sure so uh per Senate Bill 262 from last
 
02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:32.929 align:start position:0%
sure so uh per Senate Bill 262 from last
year

02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
um the legislature required the
 
02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
department to open up an investigatory
 
02:33:38.330 --> 02:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
proceeding regarding interconnect
 
02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:40.250 align:start position:0%
proceeding regarding interconnect
interconnection

02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
interconnection
 
02:33:43.370 --> 02:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
um standards requirements procedures uh
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
obviously to make sure that they are I
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
wrote it down here
 
02:33:49.730 --> 02:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
cost effective predictable and timely
 
02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
interconnection uh procedures
 
02:33:53.929 --> 02:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
um the department issued an order on
 
02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
December 5th last year opening up that
 
02:33:57.170 --> 02:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
proceeding and I could certainly provide
 
02:33:59.210 --> 02:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
a link to that web page for the
 
02:34:02.030 --> 02:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh public feedback was
 
02:34:03.770 --> 02:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
requested and I believe the public
 
02:34:05.929 --> 02:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
comment period closed at the end of
 
02:34:08.210 --> 02:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
February I believe the department is in
 
02:34:10.010 --> 02:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
the next step is in the process of
 
02:34:11.270 --> 02:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
formulating next steps for that
 
02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:12.410 align:start position:0%
formulating next steps for that
proceeding

02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
off the bat off the top of my head I
 
02:34:15.710 --> 02:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
believe it's going to be largely you
 
02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
know stakeholder sessions and that type
 
02:34:19.370 --> 02:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
of thing but overall we prefer to let
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
that process play out before making any
 
02:34:24.290 --> 02:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
02:34:29.630 --> 02:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um again I also
 
02:34:33.889 --> 02:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
want to push back on on your insistence
 
02:34:39.050 --> 02:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
that the language limiting utilities to
 
02:34:43.389 --> 02:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
to a single pilot at a time
 
02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
and your characterization that should
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
that language be removed
 
02:34:48.479 --> 02:34:49.670 align:start position:0%
that language be removed
then

02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
well then all kinds of Pilots could just
 
02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:53.630 align:start position:0%
well then all kinds of Pilots could just
be

02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:34:56.450 --> 02:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
thrown out there isn't it true that for
 
02:34:59.630 --> 02:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
any pilot program the utility must
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
carefully design and propose such
 
02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
program to the Public Utilities
 
02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
Commission and get their authorization
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
to implement that pilot program thank
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
you for the question that is correct
 
02:35:14.570 --> 02:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
um but again I I and I hate to keep
 
02:35:16.490 --> 02:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
adding on further context but there was
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
an extensive uh study committee or I
 
02:35:20.330 --> 02:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
should I believe it was a commission
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
actually that looked at a revising the
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
leap of Statute to permit these types of
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
transactions to occur the overall study
 
02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
found that you know this is this is
 
02:35:34.010 --> 02:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
something that's very technical very
 
02:35:36.770 --> 02:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
complex and requires further review
 
02:35:38.570 --> 02:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
um obviously there's a number of steps
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
such as as you mentioned puc approval
 
02:35:42.410 --> 02:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
and review going through those
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issues uh beforehand
 
02:35:47.809 --> 02:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
before these Pilots can be entertained I
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
think the department would submit just
 
02:35:51.469 --> 02:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
letting it take one step at a time let's
 
02:35:54.290 --> 02:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
clear you know the numerous hurdles
 
02:35:56.330 --> 02:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
before us before jumping to that stage
 
02:35:58.370 --> 02:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
but yes to your point the puc does
 
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
review and approve these projects
 
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman you know
 
02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:04.610 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman you know
again

02:36:04.610 --> 02:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh given I think probably your testimony
 
02:36:09.530 --> 02:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
but certainly the other testimony others
 
02:36:12.650 --> 02:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
testimony Senator Waters description of
 
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
you know how the reason for this uh bill
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
for this effort proposed effort is that
 
02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
everyone knows technology is moving fast
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities
 
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
to improve the way our grid functions
 
02:36:31.490 --> 02:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
opportunities to take advantage of new
 
02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:33.050 align:start position:0%
opportunities to take advantage of new
technologies

02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
that can lower costs remember we're
 
02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
asking questions not yes don't you I
 
02:36:41.210 --> 02:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
don't you believe that they're that
 
02:36:45.770 --> 02:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
there uh could be value in the ability
 
02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
of utilities to test multiple
 
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies at uh that are different
 
02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
from each other you know without waiting
 
02:36:58.670 --> 02:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
for sequential I mean One Pilot could be
 
02:37:00.530 --> 02:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
having to do with you know grid
 
02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
connected EVS while another pilot could
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
have to do with a completely different
 
02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:07.630 align:start position:0%
have to do with a completely different
um

02:37:07.630 --> 02:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:12.730 --> 02:37:12.740 align:start position:0%
application so why should we be
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
restricting ourselves to One Pilot at a
 
02:37:17.929 --> 02:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
time sure and again thank you for the
 
02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
question again I would submit that if
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
you're allowing
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
projects to take Place With No Cap
 
02:37:25.610 --> 02:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on the number that take place
 
02:37:28.130 --> 02:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
it's no longer a pilot it's it's just
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's just a program any number of
 
02:37:34.010 --> 02:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
projects can come forward I would submit
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
that again there are a number of of
 
02:37:37.849 --> 02:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
steps there to take place before these
 
02:37:40.190 --> 02:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
projects take place I think we should
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
let I think the department feels those
 
02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
Pro those processes should play out
 
02:37:45.710 --> 02:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
before entertaining statutory changes
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
such as this on line 29. if it is
 
02:37:49.309 --> 02:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
something in the future that the
 
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to change that and
 
02:37:52.969 --> 02:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
obviously if they want to do so now it's
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
certainly their prerogative to do so but
 
02:37:59.389 --> 02:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
the Department's uh position at least on
 
02:38:00.889 --> 02:38:00.899 align:start position:0%
the language is that it might be better
 
02:38:03.050 --> 02:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
to remove that because it again is
 
02:38:05.389 --> 02:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
essentially no longer a pilot any number
 
02:38:08.809 --> 02:38:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
can you refresh my memory about Senate
 
02:38:14.330 --> 02:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 321 from last year
 
02:38:17.450 --> 02:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
did it require the puc to
 
02:38:17.460 --> 02:38:18.730 align:start position:0%
did it require the puc to
uh

02:38:18.730 --> 02:38:18.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:22.010 --> 02:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the jurisdictional issues
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
before any pilot Pro projects could be
 
02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
proposed and that's correct yes I
 
02:38:29.389 --> 02:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
thought so thank you any further
 
02:38:31.849 --> 02:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
questions for the Department
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative partial has one thank you
 
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
chair Wells and thanks for coming today
 
02:38:38.450 --> 02:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:41.929 --> 02:38:41.939 align:start position:0%
um we were speaking about the RSA 378 uh
 
02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
0.37 and the repeal of the least cost
 
02:38:46.969 --> 02:38:46.979 align:start position:0%
integrative resource plan through House
 
02:38:50.270 --> 02:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 281 yep and now that build I
 
02:38:51.650 --> 02:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
understand is still in the Senate and
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's not yet a hearing yet yes and so
 
02:38:57.050 --> 02:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically based on what is
 
02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
current law correct okay and we may not
 
02:39:01.730 --> 02:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
need to change that should the current
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
law stand correct uh I think the
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
department just wanted to know the con
 
02:39:07.370 --> 02:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
note the conflict as the two bills kind
 
02:39:08.210 --> 02:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
of work their way through the
 
02:39:09.710 --> 02:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
legislature so thank you for putting
 
02:39:11.450 --> 02:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
that out thank you
 
02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
robesch for taking yet another question
 
02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
from me
 
02:39:20.210 --> 02:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to point us back to section
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
four on page four on
 
02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:24.050 align:start position:0%
four on page four on
um

02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:27.290 --> 02:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
on open access to transmission and
 
02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
distribution facilities because you had
 
02:39:32.809 --> 02:39:32.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned that Senate Bill 262 which I
 
02:39:34.969 --> 02:39:34.979 align:start position:0%
was a co-sponsor on
 
02:39:37.969 --> 02:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
um it resulted in an open docket at the
 
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
puc on interconnection procedures and my
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
understanding was that that bill was
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
looking to get at the inconsistency in
 
02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
the cost that people were incurring and
 
02:39:50.570 --> 02:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
trying to make connections
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
um on different projects and the fact
 
02:39:54.770 --> 02:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
that somebody need to needed to take
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
hold of it and figure out what what are
 
02:39:59.950 --> 02:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
we charging here this section however
 
02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
seems to be thoroughly in the purview of
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature in terms of trying to
 
02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
require that we have a
 
02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory open access to the
 
02:40:12.889 --> 02:40:12.899 align:start position:0%
Electric System so it's really still
 
02:40:14.809 --> 02:40:14.819 align:start position:0%
part of I think the enabling language
 
02:40:17.929 --> 02:40:17.939 align:start position:0%
that was intended here so
 
02:40:20.690 --> 02:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
um perhaps you could speak to that
 
02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
because I think again and I think I
 
02:40:23.929 --> 02:40:23.939 align:start position:0%
talked to you about this on another bill
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
another day there are two different
 
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
things and so I don't think we should be
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
accepting one based on the others no and
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I I just
 
02:40:36.770 --> 02:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
to clarify this investigatory seating is
 
02:40:38.929 --> 02:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned assemble 262 is taking
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
place at the department not the puc
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify that no thanks
 
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
no offense intended um what was it um
 
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
again I think the department would feel
 
02:40:49.929 --> 02:40:49.939 align:start position:0%
that having that
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
proceeding play out would be
 
02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
advantageous before making
 
02:40:56.990 --> 02:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
changes such as this obviously as I said
 
02:40:59.090 --> 02:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
the legislature can certainly move
 
02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
forward with this as is as is outlined
 
02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
but again we would note that um there is
 
02:41:07.070 --> 02:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
that reference to 378 colon 37 the
 
02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
investigatory proceeding is still in its
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
early stages I think we'd like to see
 
02:41:13.849 --> 02:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
that play out digest the public comment
 
02:41:15.469 --> 02:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
get the feedback from the relevant
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
stakeholders before making changes to
 
02:41:24.170 --> 02:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:26.690 --> 02:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for the
 
02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:27.830 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for the
Department

02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:41:30.469 --> 02:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and we'll move
 
02:41:33.410 --> 02:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
along next I'll call Michael Licata from
 
02:41:35.270 --> 02:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
eversource to give us the utility
 
02:41:45.770 --> 02:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:48.349 --> 02:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
good morning again Michael Licata
 
02:41:50.750 --> 02:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy I
 
02:41:52.490 --> 02:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
02:41:55.849 --> 02:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
before you on this bill uh eversource
 
02:41:57.770 --> 02:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
supports the bill as amended by the
 
02:42:00.530 --> 02:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
Senate uh that's in front of you today I
 
02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
really just wanted to voice our
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
appreciation for Senator Waters hard
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
work on this legislation and his
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
willingness to work with eversource and
 
02:42:11.690 --> 02:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders to address concerns
 
02:42:13.630 --> 02:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
that we had with the bill as introduced
 
02:42:17.469 --> 02:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
we think that uh the version before you
 
02:42:19.910 --> 02:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
represents a good and reasonable
 
02:42:21.530 --> 02:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
approach to move forward and make
 
02:42:24.650 --> 02:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
progress on these issues having The
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
Advisory Group within the doe to
 
02:42:29.450 --> 02:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
evaluate and come up with
 
02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
recommendations for Public Policy makers
 
02:42:35.170 --> 02:42:35.180 align:start position:0%
as yourself as well as the department
 
02:42:39.050 --> 02:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
and the utilities is an approach that
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're certainly consistent with this
 
02:42:42.730 --> 02:42:42.740 align:start position:0%
seems to be modeled after
 
02:42:45.770 --> 02:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
similar legislation or similar advisory
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
group in in other states and we again
 
02:42:52.130 --> 02:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
are supportive of legislation and would
 
02:42:54.170 --> 02:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer questions that the
 
02:42:56.929 --> 02:42:56.939 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much appreciate you
 
02:43:00.590 --> 02:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
being here so I have a quick question
 
02:43:03.650 --> 02:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
for you how would you uh how do you view
 
02:43:07.730 --> 02:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
the Department's characterization that
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
multiple pilot programs essentially
 
02:43:14.450 --> 02:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
are not pilot programs that they're just
 
02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:16.250 align:start position:0%
are not pilot programs that they're just
programs

02:43:16.250 --> 02:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
um we had a number of concerns with the
 
02:43:22.490 --> 02:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
changes to what I'll just call the Lipa
 
02:43:25.090 --> 02:43:25.100 align:start position:0%
Pilots as folks who
 
02:43:27.969 --> 02:43:27.979 align:start position:0%
were on the committee
 
02:43:30.889 --> 02:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
last year know that there was quite a
 
02:43:34.690 --> 02:43:34.700 align:start position:0%
bit of work done to strike a compromise
 
02:43:38.450 --> 02:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
to allow those pilots pilots to move
 
02:43:43.309 --> 02:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
forward so we were very concerned with
 
02:43:43.319 --> 02:43:44.030 align:start position:0%
forward so we were very concerned with
um

02:43:44.030 --> 02:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
making changes to that compromise that
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
we did agree to as Mr Roberts said there
 
02:43:53.270 --> 02:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
is an open adjudicative proceeding at
 
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
the commission to resolve
 
02:43:59.690 --> 02:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issues what is under the
 
02:44:01.250 --> 02:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
purview of the state what is under the
 
02:44:03.170 --> 02:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
purview of uh the Federal Energy
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission and so
 
02:44:09.050 --> 02:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
you know we're comfortable with the
 
02:44:10.849 --> 02:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
language that you have in front of you
 
02:44:12.650 --> 02:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
it does represent
 
02:44:16.370 --> 02:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
um an expansion uh however we feel that
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh the existing language
 
02:44:23.389 --> 02:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
um in place uh has you know uh enough
 
02:44:27.050 --> 02:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
rigor to uh you know have a thorough
 
02:44:30.050 --> 02:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
review of whether it's a single pilot
 
02:44:33.410 --> 02:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
offered by a utility or or more than one
 
02:44:36.650 --> 02:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
pilot so we are comfortable with this
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
but certainly understand uh where the
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
department is coming from
 
02:44:43.550 --> 02:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has one thank you
 
02:44:49.370 --> 02:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr locata I'm
 
02:44:52.010 --> 02:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
looking at demand response and you know
 
02:44:54.050 --> 02:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking all right I'm a residential
 
02:44:56.690 --> 02:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
customer not of eversource but let's say
 
02:44:58.250 --> 02:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
I work
 
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
um how would that actually work how how
 
02:45:04.130 --> 02:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
would I know what to do
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of demand response so demand
 
02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
response programs are are not new uh
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
they have been around for for many many
 
02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:15.110 align:start position:0%
they have been around for for many many
years

02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:45:18.349 --> 02:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
um the most common of them uh it has to
 
02:45:21.650 --> 02:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
do with electric water heaters uh so if
 
02:45:23.090 --> 02:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
you think about a water heater is
 
02:45:26.210 --> 02:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
essentially a a thermal battery because
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
it contains hot water that's been heated
 
02:45:31.610 --> 02:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
at certain points in time uh essentially
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
the utility has uh control over when
 
02:45:37.309 --> 02:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
your water heater runs and when it
 
02:45:40.429 --> 02:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't and so the customer that enrolls
 
02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
in that probate program might be on a
 
02:45:46.210 --> 02:45:46.220 align:start position:0%
specific rate structure or
 
02:45:49.010 --> 02:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
receive a benefit associated with
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
allowing the utility to have
 
02:45:55.490 --> 02:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
insight and control over that Appliance
 
02:45:58.010 --> 02:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
now obviously it can get much more
 
02:46:00.590 --> 02:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
sophisticated than that but that's
 
02:46:03.170 --> 02:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's a good example that again has
 
02:46:06.650 --> 02:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow up so then I as a
 
02:46:12.050 --> 02:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
customer my only decision is I enroll or
 
02:46:14.809 --> 02:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
I don't correct okay thank you
 
02:46:16.969 --> 02:46:16.979 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:46:18.889 --> 02:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um I just
 
02:46:20.330 --> 02:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
want to clarify when you said you were
 
02:46:21.770 --> 02:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the language of the
 
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill does that mean you're comfortable
 
02:46:28.730 --> 02:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
that's this is regarding the pilot
 
02:46:33.889 --> 02:46:33.899 align:start position:0%
program uh no I am comfortable with the
 
02:46:36.170 --> 02:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
legislation oh yes I'm sorry I'm getting
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
my my removes the the the bill as
 
02:46:42.290 --> 02:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate we are supportive
 
02:46:43.849 --> 02:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
of okay all right thank you thank you
 
02:46:43.859 --> 02:46:45.950 align:start position:0%
of okay all right thank you thank you
sorry

02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
additional questions for Mr locata
 
02:46:52.969 --> 02:46:52.979 align:start position:0%
seeing none will move along and I'll ask
 
02:46:55.610 --> 02:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
Mr The Honorable Clifton below to come
 
02:46:57.770 --> 02:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
and give us his perspective on this
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if um a consultant with
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
the Coalition Samuel Golding who's just
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
filled out a pink card
 
02:47:39.290 --> 02:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
um could join me here
 
02:47:41.210 --> 02:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
um certainly okay
 
02:47:43.010 --> 02:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
I would like to get the pink card though
 
02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:48.650 --> 02:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you just for the record yes
 
02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:49.969 align:start position:0%
thank you just for the record yes
certainly

02:47:49.969 --> 02:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:47:52.849 --> 02:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
um I am the chair of the community power
 
02:47:56.170 --> 02:47:56.180 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire it's a
 
02:47:58.130 --> 02:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
non-profit New Hampshire Corporation
 
02:48:00.010 --> 02:48:00.020 align:start position:0%
operating as a governmental
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
instrumentality of 32 municipalities in
 
02:48:07.849 --> 02:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
one County our 33 our 32 Municipal
 
02:48:10.730 --> 02:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
members comprise about 23 percent of the
 
02:48:13.730 --> 02:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
state's population and includes the
 
02:48:16.250 --> 02:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
cities of Nashua Portsmouth Dover Berlin
 
02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
and Lebanon as well as uh quite a few
 
02:48:19.020 --> 02:48:20.410 align:start position:0%
and Lebanon as well as uh quite a few
towns

02:48:20.410 --> 02:48:20.420 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we are established uh to operate
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation programs to
 
02:48:28.130 --> 02:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
become an alternative to fault service
 
02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
supplier for our communities and are in
 
02:48:34.610 --> 02:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
the process of launching 10 to 12 of
 
02:48:36.770 --> 02:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
those Community power programs this
 
02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:38.450 align:start position:0%
those Community power programs this
spring

02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
spring
 
02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and I'm we're here to testify in
 
02:48:44.210 --> 02:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
general support for Senate Bill 321 and
 
02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
I want to speak to
 
02:48:48.530 --> 02:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
um a couple of the provisions here and
 
02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
address the need uh to perhaps consider
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
further amendment to make the Lipa
 
02:48:56.809 --> 02:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
Pilots or the Lipa provision actually
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
work and be something that can be
 
02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:01.730 align:start position:0%
work and be something that can be
productive

02:49:01.730 --> 02:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
productive
 
02:49:03.230 --> 02:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
um in general
 
02:49:04.730 --> 02:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
um I would just note on the grid mod
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
Advisory Group that was a concept that
 
02:49:10.429 --> 02:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
came out of a number of years of grid
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
mod investigation uh by the puc and was
 
02:49:17.330 --> 02:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
a recommendation from puc staff at at
 
02:49:18.950 --> 02:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
one point in time that at one point in
 
02:49:20.570 --> 02:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
time the commission embraced but then
 
02:49:22.490 --> 02:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
there was turnover and the composition
 
02:49:23.929 --> 02:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
of the commission and it kind of got
 
02:49:26.570 --> 02:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
dropped so that this revival of that
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
provides that important forum and it is
 
02:49:33.290 --> 02:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
also particularly significant because
 
02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:35.809 align:start position:0%
also particularly significant because
um uh

02:49:35.809 --> 02:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
last August there was a ferc decision
 
02:49:41.630 --> 02:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
that uh at the request of iso New
 
02:49:43.309 --> 02:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
England that clarified that the
 
02:49:45.290 --> 02:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
interconnection of all distributed
 
02:49:47.690 --> 02:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
generation storage under five megawatts
 
02:49:49.969 --> 02:49:49.979 align:start position:0%
are connected to the distribution grid
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
and not choosing to participate in the
 
02:49:54.770 --> 02:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
iso New England RTO Market is purely
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
state jurisdictional that was never
 
02:49:58.370 --> 02:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
clear before there was sort of
 
02:49:59.690 --> 02:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
overlapping jurisdictional
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
interconnection and a lot of things got
 
02:50:04.250 --> 02:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
deferred to ISO New England's
 
02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
interconnection standards an ISO New
 
02:50:09.290 --> 02:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
England basically said this doesn't make
 
02:50:10.969 --> 02:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
sense for these smaller under five
 
02:50:12.830 --> 02:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt projects
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
um we it and ferc actually said it would
 
02:50:19.070 --> 02:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
be in the public interest to let these
 
02:50:20.570 --> 02:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
be State jurisdictional because it would
 
02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
actually allow them to inter connect
 
02:50:24.590 --> 02:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
faster and the development of these
 
02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
distributed generation and storage is
 
02:50:29.270 --> 02:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with ferc's policy of
 
02:50:32.030 --> 02:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
encouraging more generation and even if
 
02:50:34.130 --> 02:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
it affects the the price in the
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
Interstate Wholesale Market they've said
 
02:50:38.090 --> 02:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter it's a good thing and
 
02:50:39.230 --> 02:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
we're allowing that to be State
 
02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:40.790 align:start position:0%
we're allowing that to be State
jurisdictional

02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional
 
02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:41.630 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional
um

02:50:41.630 --> 02:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
so the the puc has started the
 
02:50:45.230 --> 02:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
proceeding to determine the
 
02:50:46.849 --> 02:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issue
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and some people might say well that's
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
a little odd that the commission itself
 
02:50:52.010 --> 02:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
is deciding jurisdiction but that's
 
02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
pretty standard with with any judicial
 
02:50:56.690 --> 02:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
or quasi-judicial body threshold issues
 
02:50:58.849 --> 02:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
do we have jurisdiction to decide this
 
02:50:58.859 --> 02:51:00.170 align:start position:0%
do we have jurisdiction to decide this
issue

02:51:00.170 --> 02:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and we're confident we'll Prevail on
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
the jurisdictional issue if for no other
 
02:51:07.370 --> 02:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
reason simply that over these uh past a
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
year or so these two major ferc
 
02:51:11.330 --> 02:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
decisions have for all practical
 
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
purposes said that these smaller
 
02:51:16.370 --> 02:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
projects are under State jurisdiction
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
and they can be treated as load reducers
 
02:51:21.410 --> 02:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
relative to transmission cost allocation
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
relative to capacity cost allocation
 
02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
relative to energy cost allocation and
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
an example of that is on the handout and
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
I just kind of want to walk you through
 
02:51:32.450 --> 02:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
this because in some ways Unitil has
 
02:51:36.410 --> 02:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
made the case for us with regard to the
 
02:51:38.929 --> 02:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
potential value and how these projects
 
02:51:41.570 --> 02:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
could be compensated and hopefully
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
everybody has that handout it has some
 
02:51:45.770 --> 02:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
yellow head lighting these are simply
 
02:51:47.929 --> 02:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
excerpts from the petition and a
 
02:51:50.450 --> 02:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
testimony that Unitil submitted in an
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
ongoing docket it's actually having its
 
02:51:55.969 --> 02:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
hearing tomorrow at the puc and what
 
02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
they argued was that utility scale
 
02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
renewable projects such as the 4.99
 
02:52:04.090 --> 02:52:04.100 align:start position:0%
megawatt project they're proposing
 
02:52:06.830 --> 02:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
provides tangible benefits to customers
 
02:52:09.170 --> 02:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
the this distribution system and the
 
02:52:11.809 --> 02:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
environment and they say the benefits
 
02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
include reductions to purchased energy
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
Peak demand and line losses and they go
 
02:52:18.530 --> 02:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
on and say they include avoided
 
02:52:20.269 --> 02:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
transmission costs local transmission
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
savings Regional transmission savings as
 
02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
well as wreck savings so they say they
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
operate plan to operate as a load
 
02:52:29.809 --> 02:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
reducer and later on they say this is
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
they'll do this because they will not
 
02:52:33.410 --> 02:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
register the asset with ISO New England
 
02:52:35.690 --> 02:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
and importantly at the bottom of page
 
02:52:37.730 --> 02:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
one they note that New Hampshire ranks
 
02:52:40.730 --> 02:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
47th among all states and the amount of
 
02:52:42.889 --> 02:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
electricity produced by large capacity
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
utility scale Projects New Hampshire is
 
02:52:49.250 --> 02:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
significant untapped potential in the
 
02:52:51.469 --> 02:52:51.479 align:start position:0%
utility scale solar sector that remains
 
02:52:52.969 --> 02:52:52.979 align:start position:0%
to be unlocked for the benefit of
 
02:52:54.889 --> 02:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
customers and what they're talking about
 
02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
in particular is projects in this under
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
five megawatt size that can function as
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
load reducers and probably that's sort
 
02:53:05.929 --> 02:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
of three to five five megawatt size that
 
02:53:07.790 --> 02:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
you've kind of heard there's pent-up
 
02:53:10.490 --> 02:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
demand for an opportunity for in in the
 
02:53:14.050 --> 02:53:14.060 align:start position:0%
net metering arguments well they go on
 
02:53:17.150 --> 02:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
and on page two provide more of these
 
02:53:20.090 --> 02:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
details there's a little bit of red text
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
here which is my own commentary they
 
02:53:24.830 --> 02:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
point out the commission the company is
 
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
in unique position to deliver benefits
 
02:53:29.330 --> 02:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
that would not otherwise be available if
 
02:53:31.130 --> 02:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
the project were developed by a private
 
02:53:33.290 --> 02:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
entity and generally that's true when
 
02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
you look at the way net metering or
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
group net metering works but the Lipa
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
market-based alternative
 
02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:41.750 align:start position:0%
market-based alternative
as

02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:53:45.730 --> 02:53:45.740 align:start position:0%
uh enabled as a pilot
 
02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
deals with capturing the exact same
 
02:53:51.769 --> 02:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
value stack that Unitil is making the
 
02:53:54.170 --> 02:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
case for their project on
 
02:53:57.650 --> 02:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
and I might add that the department of
 
02:54:00.410 --> 02:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
energy the consumer Advocate and clean
 
02:54:02.210 --> 02:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire have all joined
 
02:54:05.210 --> 02:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
with Unitil in endorsing this doe did
 
02:54:07.490 --> 02:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
its own analysis of the benefits and
 
02:54:10.010 --> 02:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
concluded that unitil's analysis was
 
02:54:12.610 --> 02:54:12.620 align:start position:0%
sound that the benefits are real the
 
02:54:15.889 --> 02:54:15.899 align:start position:0%
prospective benefits exceed the cost and
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
are recommending the commission to prove
 
02:54:21.170 --> 02:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
this project under 374 G
 
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and they and and I think the only
 
02:54:24.660 --> 02:54:25.969 align:start position:0%
um and they and and I think the only
reason

02:54:25.969 --> 02:54:25.979 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
um others can't deliver these values for
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
rate payers is because of the lack of a
 
02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
of a market-based alternative to realize
 
02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
these values
 
02:54:40.490 --> 02:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.010 --> 02:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page three here here are
 
02:54:46.010 --> 02:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
the key points they explain
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
um uh four major pieces of value
 
02:54:51.950 --> 02:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
and these are again the exact same
 
02:54:54.710 --> 02:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
values that are proposed to be enabled
 
02:54:57.050 --> 02:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
through the Lipa Pilots
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
and they include avoided energy costs
 
02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
avoided capacity cost which by the way
 
02:55:03.950 --> 02:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
they explain that these are actually
 
02:55:06.050 --> 02:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
very simple calculations these are not
 
02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult to quantify or
 
02:55:10.730 --> 02:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
determine in fact the formula is
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
basically spelled out here it's the
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
product of generation output at the peak
 
02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:16.250 align:start position:0%
product of generation output at the peak
hour

02:55:16.250 --> 02:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
hour
 
02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
at the estimated capacity clearing price
 
02:55:20.269 --> 02:55:20.279 align:start position:0%
or it could be the actual clearing price
 
02:55:23.929 --> 02:55:23.939 align:start position:0%
there's a quantifiable benefit and value
 
02:55:26.330 --> 02:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
local transmission and which was one of
 
02:55:28.190 --> 02:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
eversource's big bugaboos about
 
02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:30.230 align:start position:0%
eversource's big bugaboos about
jurisdiction

02:55:30.230 --> 02:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
02:55:31.910 --> 02:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
um they say that's easily computed
 
02:55:33.650 --> 02:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
because it's the product of generation
 
02:55:36.050 --> 02:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
output at the monthly peak hour and the
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
annualized transmission rate
 
02:55:40.910 --> 02:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
and also the same thing for ancillary
 
02:55:43.370 --> 02:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
services and the same thing for regional
 
02:55:45.889 --> 02:55:45.899 align:start position:0%
transmission benefits these are the
 
02:55:48.950 --> 02:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
exact same value propositions the exact
 
02:55:51.650 --> 02:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
same rate elements contemplated for the
 
02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
Lipa Pilots
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and I might add that nobody has
 
02:55:57.889 --> 02:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
questioned the jurisdiction of the
 
02:56:00.130 --> 02:56:00.140 align:start position:0%
commission to approve this treatment
 
02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
eversource is not intervened in the case
 
02:56:04.730 --> 02:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
saying no you can't get credit for
 
02:56:06.889 --> 02:56:06.899 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission costs by reducing
 
02:56:09.650 --> 02:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh the Generation by reducing your load
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the transmission system what ferc
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
said in in their decision last year is
 
02:56:16.190 --> 02:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
yes any of these projects that are under
 
02:56:17.809 --> 02:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
five megawatts
 
02:56:20.769 --> 02:56:20.779 align:start position:0%
can function as load reducers
 
02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
meaning they reduce the allocation of
 
02:56:25.730 --> 02:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
transmission costs because they're not
 
02:56:27.710 --> 02:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
actually using the transmission system
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
at the the system Peaks a coincident
 
02:56:33.530 --> 02:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
Peaks when costs are incurred
 
02:56:33.540 --> 02:56:34.130 align:start position:0%
Peaks when costs are incurred
um

02:56:34.130 --> 02:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:37.070 --> 02:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
and and it's almost that simple you know
 
02:56:39.410 --> 02:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
um where this leads us to
 
02:56:44.809 --> 02:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm going to have Mr Golding
 
02:56:46.969 --> 02:56:46.979 align:start position:0%
here speak a little bit about
 
02:56:46.979 --> 02:56:47.929 align:start position:0%
here speak a little bit about
um

02:56:47.929 --> 02:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:47.939 --> 02:56:49.190 align:start position:0%
um
um

02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:51.889 --> 02:56:51.899 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid the mistakes that other
 
02:56:54.110 --> 02:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
states have done like California and
 
02:56:56.690 --> 02:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts is well on the way uh
 
02:56:59.090 --> 02:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
to digging themselves in a hole on by
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
not enabling these market-based
 
02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to recognize the temporal
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
value or lack of value for distributed
 
02:57:09.769 --> 02:57:09.779 align:start position:0%
energy resources
 
02:57:09.779 --> 02:57:11.150 align:start position:0%
energy resources
and

02:57:11.150 --> 02:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:13.250 --> 02:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
um to help think this through I have
 
02:57:16.969 --> 02:57:16.979 align:start position:0%
provided on page five a copy of the uh
 
02:57:19.790 --> 02:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
relevant uh definitions in the leapis uh
 
02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
chapter as well as on pages six and
 
02:57:25.010 --> 02:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
seven and eight that's the text of the
 
02:57:27.230 --> 02:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
existing law that was enacted last year
 
02:57:28.690 --> 02:57:28.700 align:start position:0%
by this committee
 
02:57:31.429 --> 02:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
for enabling these Pilots
 
02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
and then on starting on page nine we
 
02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
have some uh suggestions
 
02:57:39.290 --> 02:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
um and we realize this is a lot and I
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm only going to partially go through
 
02:57:43.070 --> 02:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
some of the detail here my ask for the
 
02:57:45.170 --> 02:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
committee is that you would consider uh
 
02:57:46.969 --> 02:57:46.979 align:start position:0%
taking some time with this bill I think
 
02:57:48.889 --> 02:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
you have four weeks before you have to
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
report this bill to take a look at this
 
02:57:54.349 --> 02:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
question of whether there may actually
 
02:57:58.670 --> 02:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
be a very beneficial opportunity here to
 
02:58:00.170 --> 02:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
enable a market-based approach
 
02:58:02.030 --> 02:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with the state's energy
 
02:58:05.450 --> 02:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
strategy that can avoid all the problems
 
02:58:09.469 --> 02:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
of cost shifting and uh the concerns
 
02:58:10.790 --> 02:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
that have been raised around for
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
instance expanding net group net
 
02:58:14.809 --> 02:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
metering through this as this
 
02:58:17.269 --> 02:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
market-based cost causation based
 
02:58:17.279 --> 02:58:18.889 align:start position:0%
market-based cost causation based
approach

02:58:18.889 --> 02:58:18.899 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:58:18.899 --> 02:58:19.550 align:start position:0%
approach
um

02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:23.090 --> 02:58:23.100 align:start position:0%
and so um one of the issues here is that
 
02:58:26.330 --> 02:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
the way about the bill has passed
 
02:58:28.969 --> 02:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
um or the law as it exists today
 
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
um this is purely voluntary by the
 
02:58:32.330 --> 02:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
utilities it leaves it for the utilities
 
02:58:35.389 --> 02:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
to exercise the initiative and uh quite
 
02:58:37.309 --> 02:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
honestly in our experience of trying to
 
02:58:39.530 --> 02:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
launch community power aggregations and
 
02:58:41.450 --> 02:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
only discovering at the last minute that
 
02:58:43.730 --> 02:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
the utilities will not share data to
 
02:58:45.530 --> 02:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
enable us to provide time of use rates
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
or net metering rates
 
02:58:49.969 --> 02:58:49.979 align:start position:0%
um it's it's kind of apparent that the
 
02:58:49.979 --> 02:58:51.070 align:start position:0%
um it's it's kind of apparent that the
utilities

02:58:51.070 --> 02:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
02:58:54.650 --> 02:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
are are pretty resistance to to the kind
 
02:58:57.889 --> 02:58:57.899 align:start position:0%
of meaningful uh change that we need uh
 
02:59:00.110 --> 02:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
to to enable these cost-saving
 
02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:01.849 align:start position:0%
to to enable these cost-saving
opportunities

02:59:01.849 --> 02:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
um so because it relies particularly
 
02:59:06.050 --> 02:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
only on the utilities to volunteer Our
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
concern is that we Prevail in the
 
02:59:09.650 --> 02:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issue and we're prepared
 
02:59:11.210 --> 02:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
to go to the U.S Supreme Court if
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
necessary because we're confident we'll
 
02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
Prevail on the jurisdictional issue just
 
02:59:16.250 --> 02:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
like nobody's questioning the
 
02:59:18.410 --> 02:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the puc to approve the
 
02:59:22.610 --> 02:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
exact same uh values with Unitil that
 
02:59:24.349 --> 02:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
will get through that and the utilities
 
02:59:25.849 --> 02:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
will say no thanks we're not interesting
 
02:59:27.650 --> 02:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
doing Pilots we'll do these projects
 
02:59:31.550 --> 02:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves under 374 G you know it's it's
 
02:59:33.290 --> 02:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
it's purely at our discretion because
 
02:59:35.750 --> 02:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the current law says
 
02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:36.410 align:start position:0%
that's what the current law says
um

02:59:36.410 --> 02:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:36.420 --> 02:59:37.730 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:59:37.730 --> 02:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
um one of the suggestions is to clarify
 
02:59:42.290 --> 02:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
the jurisdictional question and that's
 
02:59:46.250 --> 02:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
if you look on page nine of um the
 
02:59:48.290 --> 02:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
handout and I'm referring to the big red
 
02:59:51.050 --> 02:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
numbers the sort of Bates page numbers
 
02:59:52.610 --> 02:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
um it's really the question is whether
 
02:59:55.610 --> 02:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction has uh to the the
 
02:59:57.530 --> 02:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to regulate sales of
 
02:59:59.389 --> 02:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
electricity and give credit for avoided
 
03:00:01.570 --> 03:00:01.580 align:start position:0%
costs for energy capacity transmission
 
03:00:04.670 --> 03:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
and Ansley Services provided by or
 
03:00:07.250 --> 03:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
through ISO New England as Allowed by
 
03:00:10.010 --> 03:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
this section also there's a reference to
 
03:00:11.809 --> 03:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
the chapter up above which is really
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
broad because it includes net metering
 
03:00:14.389 --> 03:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that probably should be
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
sectioned just from a technical point of
 
03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:16.929 align:start position:0%
sectioned just from a technical point of
view

03:00:16.929 --> 03:00:16.939 align:start position:0%
view
 
03:00:19.610 --> 03:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
so it suggests that if they resolve
 
03:00:21.410 --> 03:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
those then they have an adjudicated
 
03:00:23.450 --> 03:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
Precision to determine how to implement
 
03:00:25.610 --> 03:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
the pilot programs as Allowed by the
 
03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:26.510 align:start position:0%
the pilot programs as Allowed by the
section

03:00:26.510 --> 03:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:00:30.650 --> 03:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
and it does uh in this option
 
03:00:33.469 --> 03:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
um propose that the cap
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
on uh net metering I'm not let me this
 
03:00:37.969 --> 03:00:37.979 align:start position:0%
is not net metering
 
03:00:41.809 --> 03:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
um on these uh projects uh be uh limited
 
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
to five megawatts and overall allowed
 
03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
export capacity the distribution Grid at
 
03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
the point of interconnection but allow
 
03:00:50.809 --> 03:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
if it consists of both generation and
 
03:00:53.150 --> 03:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
storage for each to be up to that limit
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
provided the total interconnection never
 
03:00:57.950 --> 03:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
exceeds physically is constrained to
 
03:00:59.809 --> 03:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
less than five megawatts this is
 
03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
something that unitel themselves has
 
03:01:03.290 --> 03:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
suggested in their filing they said
 
03:01:05.630 --> 03:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to do 4.99 because that's
 
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
where it keeps stays under State
 
03:01:09.650 --> 03:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and we'd like to look at uh
 
03:01:11.570 --> 03:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
addering battery storage to this project
 
03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
in the future and a really important
 
03:01:15.469 --> 03:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
aspect that's interesting about the
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
Unitil proposal is for the first time
 
03:01:21.290 --> 03:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
instead of just a rack system that's
 
03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
facing due south that produces the most
 
03:01:27.410 --> 03:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours at solar noon and less in
 
03:01:28.910 --> 03:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
the morning in the evening they're
 
03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
proposing a single axis tracker that
 
03:01:33.469 --> 03:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
rotates from east to west so they
 
03:01:36.170 --> 03:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
improve the production profile in the
 
03:01:38.450 --> 03:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
morning and in the late afternoon it's
 
03:01:41.570 --> 03:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
more of a a flat shape rather than just
 
03:01:42.889 --> 03:01:42.899 align:start position:0%
this hump
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
um because when you add the dynamic
 
03:01:46.570 --> 03:01:46.580 align:start position:0%
temporal value
 
03:01:49.490 --> 03:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to look at a
 
03:01:51.530 --> 03:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
different technology that can capture
 
03:01:54.590 --> 03:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
those Dynamic values such as reducing
 
03:01:57.130 --> 03:01:57.140 align:start position:0%
coincident peak in the later afternoon
 
03:02:00.170 --> 03:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
so that is one concept
 
03:02:02.990 --> 03:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
um right now the bill limits pilot
 
03:02:05.389 --> 03:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
projects to 10 years part of the problem
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
is these projects typically are analyzed
 
03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
based on a 20-year lifestyle fan minimum
 
03:02:14.570 --> 03:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh units is projecting 30 to 40 years
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
for that project but they're basing the
 
03:02:19.849 --> 03:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
cost benefit on a 20-year cycle so to
 
03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
say we have to you know make my concern
 
03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
is the current language for Pilots is a
 
03:02:27.769 --> 03:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
setup for failure they also in the bill
 
03:02:30.530 --> 03:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
as passed by the Senate it appears to
 
03:02:33.410 --> 03:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
raise the cap on Pilots uh to five
 
03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:35.450 align:start position:0%
raise the cap on Pilots uh to five
megawatts

03:02:35.450 --> 03:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
03:02:38.150 --> 03:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
um but I'm looking at the wrong bill
 
03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:39.769 align:start position:0%
um but I'm looking at the wrong bill
um

03:02:39.769 --> 03:02:39.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:41.690 --> 03:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
oh here it is
 
03:02:43.550 --> 03:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
um but if you look carefully I want to
 
03:02:46.969 --> 03:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
turn you back to the text of the bill at
 
03:02:46.979 --> 03:02:47.809 align:start position:0%
turn you back to the text of the bill at
um

03:02:47.809 --> 03:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
on page four section six of the bill
 
03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
at uh line 28 does say projects shall be
 
03:02:56.750 --> 03:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
limited to five megawatts in overall
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
size but then when you turn the page on
 
03:03:01.370 --> 03:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
page five
 
03:03:03.650 --> 03:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
um still referring to the same issue at
 
03:03:06.050 --> 03:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
line four it says if the jurisdictional
 
03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
conflicts under paragraph three are
 
03:03:10.550 --> 03:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
successfully resolved the commission can
 
03:03:12.530 --> 03:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
increase the allowed size of Pilots to
 
03:03:14.990 --> 03:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
two megawatts
 
03:03:17.750 --> 03:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
um which is less than what was
 
03:03:20.030 --> 03:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
previously provided for utility serving
 
03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
less than 20 percent of New Hampshire
 
03:03:24.590 --> 03:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
load which would be Unitil and um uh
 
03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
Liberty and up to five megawatts for any
 
03:03:29.450 --> 03:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
utility serving more than 50 percent of
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire load well I think as
 
03:03:34.370 --> 03:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
you've heard two megawatts is not The
 
03:03:36.050 --> 03:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
Sweet Spot the cost to do
 
03:03:38.090 --> 03:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
interconnection for one or two megawatt
 
03:03:40.670 --> 03:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
project can be as much as to do a four
 
03:03:43.309 --> 03:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
or five megawatt projects with you know
 
03:03:45.410 --> 03:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
half or a third of the amount of
 
03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours to spread that
 
03:03:48.889 --> 03:03:48.899 align:start position:0%
interconnection cost for
 
03:03:51.050 --> 03:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
um so as Unitil makes the case The Sweet
 
03:03:54.230 --> 03:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
Spot is right up to 4.99 megawatts where
 
03:03:56.570 --> 03:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
you get the most value so limiting
 
03:03:59.330 --> 03:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
Pilots to two megawatts just is a setup
 
03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:00.650 align:start position:0%
Pilots to two megawatts just is a setup
for

03:04:00.650 --> 03:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:07.370 --> 03:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
can we interrupt you for a question okay
 
03:04:08.990 --> 03:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
03:04:12.769 --> 03:04:12.779 align:start position:0%
below for taking my question when the
 
03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
doe testified they suggested that we
 
03:04:18.410 --> 03:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
put a period after the word successfully
 
03:04:20.690 --> 03:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
resolved and eliminate the rest of the
 
03:04:22.490 --> 03:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
sentence on page five
 
03:04:25.370 --> 03:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh starting at line five and so I'm
 
03:04:27.530 --> 03:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
wondering whether that would resolve the
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
limitations that you see the that appear
 
03:04:32.269 --> 03:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
to be inconsistent yes that that would
 
03:04:35.389 --> 03:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
help to at least um allow a single or at
 
03:04:37.309 --> 03:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
least allow project up to up to five
 
03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
megawatts I might add
 
03:04:42.530 --> 03:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
well the Senate Bill 321 is passed last
 
03:04:44.750 --> 03:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
year by the Senate didn't have any caps
 
03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
on pilots and
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to
 
03:04:49.439 --> 03:04:50.809 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to
um

03:04:50.809 --> 03:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:53.929 --> 03:04:53.939 align:start position:0%
uh I'm quickly hit on a few points and
 
03:04:55.790 --> 03:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
wrap up and let Mr Golden say a little
 
03:04:55.800 --> 03:04:56.570 align:start position:0%
wrap up and let Mr Golden say a little
bit

03:04:56.570 --> 03:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
bit
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
um about the bigger picture here uh but
 
03:05:02.809 --> 03:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
um on page 10 of the handout there is
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
some additional language it does call uh
 
03:05:08.990 --> 03:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
for each distribution utility shall
 
03:05:11.929 --> 03:05:11.939 align:start position:0%
participate in one or more pilots
 
03:05:15.790 --> 03:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
um and calls for the puc
 
03:05:17.830 --> 03:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
to actually
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
allow the size of Pilots to be up to 15
 
03:05:22.969 --> 03:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
megawatts for utility serving less than
 
03:05:25.190 --> 03:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
20 percent of New Hampshire's load and
 
03:05:27.230 --> 03:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
up to 30 megawatts for any utility
 
03:05:29.210 --> 03:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
serving more than 50 percent of New
 
03:05:31.370 --> 03:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's loads in other words Unitil
 
03:05:34.370 --> 03:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
and Liberty up to 15 megawatts
 
03:05:37.130 --> 03:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
ever Source up to 30. for the smaller
 
03:05:39.410 --> 03:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
that could be just three four or five
 
03:05:43.250 --> 03:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
projects for 30 that's maybe half a
 
03:05:46.490 --> 03:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
dozen seven or eight projects
 
03:05:48.410 --> 03:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
um and we think there's probably dozens
 
03:05:50.450 --> 03:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
and dozens of opportunities where this
 
03:05:52.490 --> 03:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
can be cost effective and produce
 
03:05:55.490 --> 03:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
significant net direct benefits to rate
 
03:05:58.130 --> 03:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
payers plus very substantial indirect
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
benefits in terms of economic activity
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh and other benefits that are actually
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
analyzed and Quantified by Unitil but
 
03:06:10.130 --> 03:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
aren't even used to fully to justify in
 
03:06:11.950 --> 03:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit test
 
03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
the last part of the handout starting on
 
03:06:17.929 --> 03:06:17.939 align:start position:0%
page 13 is another alternative which I
 
03:06:19.969 --> 03:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
think you might seriously want to
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
consider if you really want New
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to follow its state energy
 
03:06:27.830 --> 03:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
strategy and the original intent of
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
restructuring which is to enable a
 
03:06:32.210 --> 03:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
competitive market using appropriate
 
03:06:35.870 --> 03:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
price signals to uh a drive Innovation
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
and produce value for rate payers in a
 
03:06:40.610 --> 03:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
way that avoids cost shifting or
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
subsidization altogether
 
03:06:45.650 --> 03:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and and nobody's raised the issue
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
that what unitels is doing is creating
 
03:06:49.790 --> 03:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
cross-subsidy or subsidization because
 
03:06:51.050 --> 03:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
they're just they're actually
 
03:06:53.450 --> 03:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
quantifying the actual Financial
 
03:06:56.690 --> 03:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
benefits of reducing load at coincident
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
Peak it's it's almost that simple and
 
03:07:01.250 --> 03:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
quite honestly our other New England
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
states are chasing that same idea with
 
03:07:06.650 --> 03:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
aggressive demand response and storage
 
03:07:10.370 --> 03:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
programs so absent enabling something
 
03:07:13.010 --> 03:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
like this New Hampshire is likely see an
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
increasing share of the total
 
03:07:18.290 --> 03:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
transmission cost allocation let me stop
 
03:07:20.929 --> 03:07:20.939 align:start position:0%
there and I would like to ask Mr Golding
 
03:07:24.490 --> 03:07:24.500 align:start position:0%
to talk about why this is an opportunity
 
03:07:27.530 --> 03:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
to help New Hampshire prevent some of
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
the mistakes that uh perhaps we might be
 
03:07:33.769 --> 03:07:33.779 align:start position:0%
headed toward if the only option for
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
this kind of distributed generation is
 
03:07:38.750 --> 03:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
the kind of a group net metering we have
 
03:07:41.269 --> 03:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
where the utilities paying the full cost
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
of what is exported to the grid and
 
03:07:47.330 --> 03:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
charging to to to the group charging
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
that uh to rate payers is a stranded
 
03:07:52.130 --> 03:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
cost or delivery charge and then not
 
03:07:54.590 --> 03:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
even counting that output as an offset
 
03:07:57.769 --> 03:07:57.779 align:start position:0%
to to the members of the group the same
 
03:07:59.210 --> 03:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
the members of the group have to just
 
03:08:00.889 --> 03:08:00.899 align:start position:0%
turn around and buy those in kilowatt
 
03:08:03.650 --> 03:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
hours and pay for them on top of um
 
03:08:04.969 --> 03:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
being a member of the group so they're
 
03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
not even actually off takers in that
 
03:08:07.319 --> 03:08:11.389 align:start position:0%
not even actually off takers in that
construct

03:08:11.389 --> 03:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:12.950 --> 03:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
um as Cliff mentioned
 
03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:15.950 align:start position:0%
um as Cliff mentioned
um

03:08:15.950 --> 03:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:18.410 --> 03:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
well I'll take a step back
 
03:08:21.710 --> 03:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire's competitive market
 
03:08:24.910 --> 03:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
has stalled in terms of its ability to
 
03:08:27.889 --> 03:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
serve an increasing customer base and
 
03:08:30.110 --> 03:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
create new customer value so about four
 
03:08:32.450 --> 03:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
out of five customers remain on utility
 
03:08:35.330 --> 03:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
administered default service with the
 
03:08:38.809 --> 03:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
Advent of community power we intend for
 
03:08:40.730 --> 03:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
significant volumes of customers to
 
03:08:42.469 --> 03:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
access competitive markets and price
 
03:08:45.889 --> 03:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
signals as Cliff mentioned the Coalition
 
03:08:48.769 --> 03:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
has discovered that it is not possible
 
03:08:51.230 --> 03:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
to offer through the utilities as
 
03:08:52.969 --> 03:08:52.979 align:start position:0%
Community power as opposed to as
 
03:08:54.650 --> 03:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers are supposed to be
 
03:08:57.230 --> 03:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
able to it is not possible to offer
 
03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
Innovative rate structures three-part
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
time of use or net energy metering
 
03:09:06.230 --> 03:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
on the same sort of Technology platform
 
03:09:08.210 --> 03:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
the Billing System the median system
 
03:09:12.110 --> 03:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
that the utility is owning operating and
 
03:09:15.530 --> 03:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
controlling to provide those same sorts
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
of value enabling services to the mass
 
03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
Market customer base this bill is about
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
the section that Cliff was just
 
03:09:27.950 --> 03:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
referring to is about whether or not and
 
03:09:31.730 --> 03:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
how to allow competitive market entities
 
03:09:31.740 --> 03:09:33.849 align:start position:0%
how to allow competitive market entities
to

03:09:33.849 --> 03:09:33.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:09:37.550 --> 03:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
construct small scale resources
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire's communities
 
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
as every single distribution utility has
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
either proposed or is currently doing
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
or whether those should continue to be
 
03:09:53.690 --> 03:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
viewed as somehow utility Pilots right
 
03:09:57.469 --> 03:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
that the utilities May propose or kind
 
03:09:58.510 --> 03:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
of have
 
03:10:02.809 --> 03:10:02.819 align:start position:0%
control over designing how they play out
 
03:10:06.170 --> 03:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to point out that you
 
03:10:06.180 --> 03:10:06.849 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to point out that you
know

03:10:06.849 --> 03:10:06.859 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
markets that are markets can't work if
 
03:10:12.469 --> 03:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
they're designed to fail to put it
 
03:10:12.479 --> 03:10:14.830 align:start position:0%
they're designed to fail to put it
simply

03:10:14.830 --> 03:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
simply
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
utilities have a regulated business
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
model in which they invest Capital into
 
03:10:23.630 --> 03:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
the distribution grid and the
 
03:10:26.090 --> 03:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
transmission Network and they're paid a
 
03:10:28.190 --> 03:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
return on that capital
 
03:10:32.090 --> 03:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
so they have an overriding incentive not
 
03:10:35.450 --> 03:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
to lower Peak demand because whenever
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
customers are all using electricity at
 
03:10:39.650 --> 03:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
the same times on the local grid and the
 
03:10:41.570 --> 03:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
regional transmission Network it
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
increases the size that those grids have
 
03:10:46.450 --> 03:10:46.460 align:start position:0%
to be so there's just a direct line
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
between and financial conflict between
 
03:10:53.230 --> 03:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
having the utilities be The Gatekeepers
 
03:10:58.130 --> 03:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
to projects and services that are
 
03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
based on market price signals and our
 
03:11:03.769 --> 03:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
incentivizing customers and communities
 
03:11:08.330 --> 03:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:08.340 --> 03:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
if

03:11:10.790 --> 03:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
yeah so with that as just kind of the
 
03:11:14.690 --> 03:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
general context
 
03:11:14.700 --> 03:11:15.469 align:start position:0%
general context
um

03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
this sort of situation this is kind of
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
Market design Distortion you find across
 
03:11:23.570 --> 03:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of different states California
 
03:11:25.790 --> 03:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts all the kind of partially
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
restructured states where actually a lot
 
03:11:31.550 --> 03:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
of customers have remained on default
 
03:11:33.650 --> 03:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
service administered by utilities and
 
03:11:35.570 --> 03:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
utilities have remained in control of
 
03:11:38.809 --> 03:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
metering and billing you often find that
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
the Practical reality is competitive
 
03:11:47.210 --> 03:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
suppliers and aggregators simply cannot
 
03:11:50.750 --> 03:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
innovate to the same degree using the
 
03:11:53.090 --> 03:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
same systems as the utilities are using
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
for their own programs and so
 
03:11:59.809 --> 03:11:59.819 align:start position:0%
far enough down that path what
 
03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
inevitably happens
 
03:12:06.309 --> 03:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
is legislatures and utility commissions
 
03:12:09.070 --> 03:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
start to
 
03:12:13.730 --> 03:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
think that the only way forward to
 
03:12:16.910 --> 03:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
create Innovation and change and to kind
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
of accommodate
 
03:12:20.929 --> 03:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
um the challenges that may otherwise
 
03:12:23.570 --> 03:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
destabilize the grid going forward
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
is to further empower the utilities to
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
rely on the utilities to administer
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
programs to rely on the state Regulatory
 
03:12:33.950 --> 03:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
Commission to somehow evolve those
 
03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:35.410 align:start position:0%
Commission to somehow evolve those
programs

03:12:35.410 --> 03:12:35.420 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:12:37.910 --> 03:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the competitive markets start to
 
03:12:40.730 --> 03:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
fail because they just can't they can't
 
03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
create value right
 
03:12:42.359 --> 03:12:46.250 align:start position:0%
create value right
um

03:12:46.250 --> 03:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:48.530 --> 03:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
03:12:50.809 --> 03:12:50.819 align:start position:0%
the deeper story of what has been
 
03:12:54.050 --> 03:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
happening I I believe in California for
 
03:12:56.230 --> 03:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
about 15 years
 
03:12:59.170 --> 03:12:59.180 align:start position:0%
and the you know
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
the grids are there's a lot of variable
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
Renewables with gnome fuel costs coming
 
03:13:09.050 --> 03:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
on to these networks
 
03:13:09.060 --> 03:13:12.050 align:start position:0%
on to these networks
um

03:13:12.050 --> 03:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
to balance that the whole kind of
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
strategy is to incentivize demand
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility and lots of intelligently
 
03:13:26.809 --> 03:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
managed local generation which can be
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
um ratcheted up or down in response to
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
market price signals which are a proxy
 
03:13:35.090 --> 03:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
for grid stability right so price spikes
 
03:13:37.309 --> 03:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's actually the underlying driver of
 
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
that is often if it's you know it could
 
03:13:43.490 --> 03:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
be fuel costs marginal dispatch but then
 
03:13:45.889 --> 03:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
at a certain point it's actually Rising
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
because the grid needs to shed load in
 
03:13:50.809 --> 03:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
certain locations to balance Supply
 
03:13:50.819 --> 03:13:52.190 align:start position:0%
certain locations to balance Supply
demand

03:13:52.190 --> 03:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
demand
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
and if you can't do that then you start
 
03:13:57.410 --> 03:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
to have real issues
 
03:13:57.420 --> 03:13:59.090 align:start position:0%
to have real issues
um

03:13:59.090 --> 03:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:03.290 --> 03:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
the lack of that sort of
 
03:14:03.300 --> 03:14:04.809 align:start position:0%
the lack of that sort of

03:14:04.809 --> 03:14:04.819 align:start position:0%

03:14:19.670 --> 03:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
drives the cost of electricity way up in
 
03:14:21.769 --> 03:14:21.779 align:start position:0%
other words it it makes the whole system
 
03:14:21.779 --> 03:14:22.990 align:start position:0%
other words it it makes the whole system
efficient

03:14:22.990 --> 03:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
03:14:25.130 --> 03:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
inefficient can I interrupt you for just
 
03:14:27.290 --> 03:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
a second one more sentence because I'm
 
03:14:29.330 --> 03:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
about to finish okay finish your point
 
03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:31.010 align:start position:0%
about to finish okay finish your point
thanks

03:14:31.010 --> 03:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:14:31.020 --> 03:14:31.790 align:start position:0%
thanks
um

03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:33.670 --> 03:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
that actually undermines the entire
 
03:14:39.650 --> 03:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
ability of the system to continue
 
03:14:42.290 --> 03:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
evolving because customers do not find
 
03:14:44.809 --> 03:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
it in their financial interest to to
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
Electrify their vehicles Electrify their
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
water heaters and so on and so forth
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
that is actually playing out in
 
03:14:55.130 --> 03:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
California right now and that is the
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
pathway that a lot of New England states
 
03:14:59.809 --> 03:14:59.819 align:start position:0%
are on and this is the opportunity to
 
03:15:02.210 --> 03:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
kind of come out and get ahead of the
 
03:15:04.190 --> 03:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
entire pack and show how to do it
 
03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:05.330 align:start position:0%
entire pack and show how to do it
correctly

03:15:05.330 --> 03:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
03:15:05.340 --> 03:15:07.849 align:start position:0%
correctly
please

03:15:07.849 --> 03:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:15:09.650 --> 03:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
so the reason I interrupted you is
 
03:15:12.349 --> 03:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
because fascinating as this discussion
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
is it has wandered it seems to me quite
 
03:15:16.730 --> 03:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
a way is from the subject before us
 
03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
which is Senate bill 166.
 
03:15:22.090 --> 03:15:22.100 align:start position:0%
so unless you can
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
tie your discussion specifically to
 
03:15:28.070 --> 03:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 166 I'd like to move on
 
03:15:32.590 --> 03:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
sure the point of all of that was to
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
underscore how inappropriate it is to be
 
03:15:38.510 --> 03:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
viewing the utilities as the ones that
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
should be driving this they more
 
03:15:43.849 --> 03:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
appropriately should be viewed as the
 
03:15:47.450 --> 03:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
administrators the managers of these
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
metering and data systems and right now
 
03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
we have them using those systems to
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
perform the same calculations required
 
03:15:58.929 --> 03:15:58.939 align:start position:0%
to make these projects work
 
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
that could be extended open access to
 
03:16:06.650 --> 03:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
the competitive market forces so in
 
03:16:08.690 --> 03:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
other words Community power aggregators
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
and competitive suppliers could be
 
03:16:13.730 --> 03:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
proposing these projects and the
 
03:16:15.889 --> 03:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
utilities wouldn't have kind of a
 
03:16:18.290 --> 03:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping ability or much role other
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
than okay you now perform the same
 
03:16:23.450 --> 03:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
calculations you're doing for your
 
03:16:26.929 --> 03:16:26.939 align:start position:0%
project over here unitiler and all of
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
them for this new project that's
 
03:16:31.790 --> 03:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually arms length between a
 
03:16:34.010 --> 03:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
competitive market entity and its
 
03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
customer base
 
03:16:38.929 --> 03:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
if I made quickly um just to tie this
 
03:16:38.939 --> 03:16:40.130 align:start position:0%
if I made quickly um just to tie this
off

03:16:40.130 --> 03:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:16:44.929 --> 03:16:44.939 align:start position:0%
um the the Lipa alternative is a way to
 
03:16:47.530 --> 03:16:47.540 align:start position:0%
do uh to enable
 
03:16:50.990 --> 03:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
market-based development of projects
 
03:16:55.790 --> 03:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
under five megawatts that don't require
 
03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:57.010 align:start position:0%
under five megawatts that don't require
um

03:16:57.010 --> 03:16:57.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
subsidy or cross uh
 
03:17:02.750 --> 03:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
cost shifting
 
03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:03.469 align:start position:0%
cost shifting
um

03:17:03.469 --> 03:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:06.889 --> 03:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
that would enable the projects to be
 
03:17:09.370 --> 03:17:09.380 align:start position:0%
responsive to Dynamic price signals
 
03:17:12.230 --> 03:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
rather than our current construct under
 
03:17:14.090 --> 03:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
net meeting which is all kilowatt hours
 
03:17:16.250 --> 03:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
are the same and when you say all
 
03:17:19.969 --> 03:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours are valued equally I I
 
03:17:22.429 --> 03:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
think that's going to evolve in the net
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
metering proceeding at the puc but it
 
03:17:28.910 --> 03:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't uh you end up digging
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
a hole in terms of solar noon which
 
03:17:32.389 --> 03:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
we're already starting to see in New
 
03:17:34.969 --> 03:17:34.979 align:start position:0%
England where prices can dip very low in
 
03:17:37.010 --> 03:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
the middle of the day and and yet we're
 
03:17:38.990 --> 03:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
valuing those kilowatts the same as the
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours that are produced uh
 
03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
later in the day when you're helping
 
03:17:46.849 --> 03:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
offset a coincident Peak demand so the
 
03:17:51.469 --> 03:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
point is this this is an as Unitil has
 
03:17:53.750 --> 03:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
shown in economically viable way to
 
03:17:57.010 --> 03:17:57.020 align:start position:0%
develop projects that doesn't involve
 
03:17:59.570 --> 03:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
cross-subsidy that can benefit all rate
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
payers and and and and the projects
 
03:18:05.929 --> 03:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
would evolve in a market-based concept
 
03:18:09.290 --> 03:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
context to be selected to to there'd be
 
03:18:11.210 --> 03:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
competitive procurement where the most
 
03:18:13.969 --> 03:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
cost effective projects make sense right
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
now it's any project can make sense if
 
03:18:18.290 --> 03:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
it can if it works off of the full
 
03:18:19.969 --> 03:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
default service rate for all kilowatt
 
03:18:22.969 --> 03:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
hours that's not a model for future
 
03:18:26.450 --> 03:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
success and future grid stability that
 
03:18:28.490 --> 03:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's our point
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
I I would wonder have you discussed uh
 
03:18:33.889 --> 03:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
this with Senator Waters because the
 
03:18:35.809 --> 03:18:35.819 align:start position:0%
path you're putting us on is a path to
 
03:18:37.490 --> 03:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if Senator Waters wants
 
03:18:42.290 --> 03:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
to go that direction but the
 
03:18:44.030 --> 03:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
complexities that you're introducing
 
03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:44.990 align:start position:0%
complexities that you're introducing
here

03:18:44.990 --> 03:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
are not complexities that I think we can
 
03:18:48.530 --> 03:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
deal with you mentioned that we have
 
03:18:50.269 --> 03:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
four weeks left well I'm not sure that's
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
enough time to deal with all this
 
03:18:54.950 --> 03:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
well maybe take a look at some of it and
 
03:18:56.750 --> 03:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
see what you can do we you know would
 
03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
like to see the bill move forward but
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
we'd also like to see a meaningful
 
03:19:04.250 --> 03:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity at least for Pilots that
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
that can can make economic sense
 
03:19:09.230 --> 03:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the committee
 
03:19:11.450 --> 03:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question Mr
 
03:19:12.889 --> 03:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
chairman this is actually a comment to
 
03:19:14.870 --> 03:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm wondering whether we could
 
03:19:16.730 --> 03:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
try and put together a work
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
session to examine these amongst
 
03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
ourselves a little more closely
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's possible but we'll have to discuss
 
03:19:27.710 --> 03:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
that later yeah
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
Reynolds has a question well thank you
 
03:19:34.370 --> 03:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I guess my question is
 
03:19:36.530 --> 03:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
going to hopefully be responsive to your
 
03:19:38.330 --> 03:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
comment but it's a question to the
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
witness aren't you I'm just interpreting
 
03:19:42.650 --> 03:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
all of your
 
03:19:45.950 --> 03:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony to be
 
03:19:50.510 --> 03:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
in support of the elements of
 
03:19:56.269 --> 03:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
SB 166 that make some changes to the
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
definitions and the scope of pilot
 
03:20:03.050 --> 03:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
projects it isn't it I mean that
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
the bill I think the amendments are that
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
simple but obviously you've provided us
 
03:20:09.769 --> 03:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
with a lot of
 
03:20:09.779 --> 03:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
with a lot of
reason

03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:20:14.210 --> 03:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
for doing so would you would you agree
 
03:20:15.130 --> 03:20:15.140 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes and I I won't mention I think the
 
03:20:21.769 --> 03:20:21.779 align:start position:0%
chair did a very good effort to try to
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
figure out the right language for the
 
03:20:25.730 --> 03:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
the chair and the other members of the
 
03:20:28.010 --> 03:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
committee that worked on this to try to
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh try to create a pilot that could work
 
03:20:33.290 --> 03:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of opportunity for
 
03:20:35.690 --> 03:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
discussion in terms of the final text of
 
03:20:36.830 --> 03:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
um so I think some of these things are
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
trying to address those elements that um
 
03:20:46.210 --> 03:20:46.220 align:start position:0%
and and some of the text on page 10
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
concern concerns the fact that there's
 
03:20:51.469 --> 03:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
some language in the existing
 
03:20:54.530 --> 03:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
um uh uh statute that is actually quite
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
hard to interpret and so
 
03:20:59.570 --> 03:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
um would appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:21:01.550 --> 03:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
spend a little bit more time with those
 
03:21:03.290 --> 03:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
to see if we can't
 
03:21:05.889 --> 03:21:05.899 align:start position:0%
in Fairly short order figure out a
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisan sort of fix that that can uh
 
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
actually make this a viable option that
 
03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
we can explore as a state
 
03:21:18.230 --> 03:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
other questions for The Honorable Mr
 
03:21:20.809 --> 03:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
below uh representative lewicki has a
 
03:21:23.210 --> 03:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:21:26.690 --> 03:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
you for being here and this is probably
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
not a well-formed question because some
 
03:21:31.490 --> 03:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is new to me but it
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
appears that in your document you're
 
03:21:37.130 --> 03:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
talking about moving people to a demand
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
basis you know rather than default
 
03:21:41.210 --> 03:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
service and
 
03:21:44.269 --> 03:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
for many of us that's just electricity
 
03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
is just not an expense that we even
 
03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
think about because you know they split
 
03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
the bill so now two-thirds of it is
 
03:21:52.610 --> 03:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
transmission and one-third is actual
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity and I get these
 
03:21:57.170 --> 03:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
bozos that excuse the expression call me
 
03:21:59.210 --> 03:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
up and say switch over to hours and
 
03:22:01.070 --> 03:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
lower your electric rate and we're
 
03:22:02.750 --> 03:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the difference between you
 
03:22:04.250 --> 03:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
know thirty dollars a month and uh
 
03:22:05.690 --> 03:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars a month and it's just
 
03:22:09.650 --> 03:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
like it's just a nuisance and so why
 
03:22:12.230 --> 03:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
would I switch to a demand situation on
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
something that is such a small part of
 
03:22:15.070 --> 03:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
my existence
 
03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
there's nothing really in this bill
 
03:22:19.250 --> 03:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's about an individual residential
 
03:22:21.349 --> 03:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
customer in fact the pilots and and
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in this uh suggestions changes
 
03:22:25.630 --> 03:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
it is is
 
03:22:27.469 --> 03:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
residential customers can't even
 
03:22:30.230 --> 03:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
participate you know as a potential you
 
03:22:33.170 --> 03:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
know off taker if you will uh for these
 
03:22:35.570 --> 03:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
limited producers so it right now it's
 
03:22:38.570 --> 03:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
structured so it's for suppliers
 
03:22:39.950 --> 03:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
um like competitive suppliers or
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregations as a
 
03:22:45.530 --> 03:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
potential power source and for larger
 
03:22:47.809 --> 03:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial customers who can
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh for whom there is value in terms of
 
03:22:53.929 --> 03:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
responding to these price signals for
 
03:22:53.939 --> 03:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
responding to these price signals for
instance

03:22:57.110 --> 03:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
and just to put this in the the cost
 
03:23:03.170 --> 03:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
benefits and context uh the community
 
03:23:05.090 --> 03:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
power Coalition conducted Financial
 
03:23:07.250 --> 03:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
modeling and energy modeling looking out
 
03:23:11.090 --> 03:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
over about a five-year six year period
 
03:23:15.229 --> 03:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
um and these projects provided that they
 
03:23:19.190 --> 03:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
are compensated for saving uh or for
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
creating the benefits they save in terms
 
03:23:23.090 --> 03:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
of avoiding transmission costs and
 
03:23:26.830 --> 03:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
distribution costs or transmission and
 
03:23:29.389 --> 03:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
generation capacity costs in addition to
 
03:23:29.399 --> 03:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
generation capacity costs in addition to
energy

03:23:30.950 --> 03:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
um they generate twice as much value for
 
03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
customers as the contract cost required
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
to build the new resource
 
03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
and that from a portfolio perspective
 
03:23:47.450 --> 03:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
saves about 30 percent it's 30 percent
 
03:23:50.929 --> 03:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
cheaper to Source electricity from
 
03:23:54.769 --> 03:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
small scale in-state assets than it is
 
03:23:58.010 --> 03:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
to continue just buying wholesale power
 
03:24:00.170 --> 03:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
and paying for its delivery into the
 
03:24:02.690 --> 03:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
state so so as Cliff mentioned there's
 
03:24:05.150 --> 03:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
quite a few that I mean there could be
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
quite a number of these projects being
 
03:24:09.469 --> 03:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
built by market forces just based on
 
03:24:11.929 --> 03:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
those economics alone providing
 
03:24:15.170 --> 03:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
significant rate relief to customers
 
03:24:17.210 --> 03:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
large and small particularly through
 
03:24:19.610 --> 03:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
these Community power aggregators that
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
are beginning to launch this year
 
03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:26.030 align:start position:0%
are beginning to launch this year
mm-hmm

03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
okay representative Kaplan has a
 
03:24:31.370 --> 03:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
question yeah just a curiosity question
 
03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
you you um you mentioned you've done
 
03:24:36.050 --> 03:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
studies and you've uh you've costed it
 
03:24:38.570 --> 03:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
out the benefit of uh growth in the
 
03:24:40.429 --> 03:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
community projects as you outlined in
 
03:24:43.010 --> 03:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
your in your handout here do you
 
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
actually have uh
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know project developers that have
 
03:24:49.370 --> 03:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
contacted you in terms of 15 to 30
 
03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
megawatt utilities not under five
 
03:24:54.830 --> 03:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
megawatts is all we're looking at the 15
 
03:24:57.650 --> 03:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
or 30 would allow several of those uh
 
03:25:00.530 --> 03:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
and and yes particularly as
 
03:25:03.410 --> 03:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
um we've become more visible in the news
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
we've had numerous uh developers reach
 
03:25:09.050 --> 03:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
out to us including a number who've
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
secured very good sites and have
 
03:25:13.490 --> 03:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
interconnection POS you know figured out
 
03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
the interconnection uh that they've been
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
sort of stockpiling with the expectation
 
03:25:20.150 --> 03:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
that net metering would expand to five
 
03:25:22.190 --> 03:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
megawatts in general
 
03:25:24.830 --> 03:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
um uh but this is another alternative
 
03:25:28.010 --> 03:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
that I think uh you know they're seeing
 
03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
that this is another viable alternative
 
03:25:32.090 --> 03:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
if this actually moves ahead
 
03:25:34.370 --> 03:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
um so yes I think there's a lot of
 
03:25:37.370 --> 03:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
potential projects out there
 
03:25:40.429 --> 03:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
that that will that will make sense in a
 
03:25:42.349 --> 03:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
market-based construct
 
03:25:44.450 --> 03:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
but they also make sense under group net
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
metering so they're going to go
 
03:25:50.150 --> 03:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you've given us
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
a lot to uh think about here and I
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
apologize I had a necktied layout this
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
morning and I forgot to bring it with me
 
03:26:01.550 --> 03:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
no apology needed
 
03:26:03.469 --> 03:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
well I had hoped to avoid this but it
 
03:26:04.729 --> 03:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like we're going to be able
 
03:26:07.010 --> 03:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
to do so I had hoped that we'd hear all
 
03:26:10.370 --> 03:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
of these bills in one block and then end
 
03:26:14.210 --> 03:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
our day but it's gone on too long we
 
03:26:16.490 --> 03:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
haven't had a break now for almost three
 
03:26:17.990 --> 03:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
and a half hours so I'm gonna have to
 
03:26:19.610 --> 03:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
call a lunch break
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
and bring everybody back here at 150 and
 
03:26:25.309 --> 03:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
I apologize Senator Waters I I had hoped
 
03:26:27.070 --> 03:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
that you could
 
03:26:31.309 --> 03:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay so we're gonna break now and we'll
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
be back at 1 15. we have three more
 
03:26:37.269 --> 03:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
speakers on 166 and then we have five on
 
03:26:40.670 --> 03:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
167. so plan on being here I'd say at
 
03:26:44.210 --> 03:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
least until probably 2 30 or 3 o'clock
 
03:27:12.130 --> 03:27:12.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:28.610 --> 03:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
seems

03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:38.720 --> 03:27:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
potatoes

03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:03.790 --> 03:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:11.170 --> 03:28:11.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.170 --> 03:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.180 --> 03:28:33.769 align:start position:0%
 
benefits

03:28:33.769 --> 03:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:33.779 --> 03:28:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:54.239 --> 03:29:11.570 align:start position:0%
 
example

03:29:11.570 --> 03:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:16.250 --> 03:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:16.260 --> 03:30:18.889 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:30:18.889 --> 03:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:30.700 --> 03:30:30.710 align:start position:0%
just going to stay on the screen Museum
 
03:30:30.710 --> 03:30:52.750 align:start position:0%
just going to stay on the screen Museum
[Music]

03:30:52.750 --> 03:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.760 --> 03:31:01.610 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:31:01.610 --> 03:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:31:02.880 --> 03:32:31.929 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

03:32:31.929 --> 03:32:31.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:34.690 --> 03:32:34.700 align:start position:0%
you get more and more hours
 
03:32:58.269 --> 03:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.190 --> 03:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's a big price drop for everyone if
 
03:33:03.050 --> 03:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
you ship that scene
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
um uh low to off the low price period
 
03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
when the price bit stack is fair goes to
 
03:33:11.389 --> 03:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
the flat they only increase a little bit
 
03:33:13.849 --> 03:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
that you save a lot and we don't have a
 
03:33:13.859 --> 03:33:15.590 align:start position:0%
that you save a lot and we don't have a
dynamic

03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
dynamic
 
03:33:15.600 --> 03:33:23.750 align:start position:0%
dynamic
okay

03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:23.760 --> 03:33:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
I said

03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.929 --> 03:33:28.939 align:start position:0%
it was still trying to fit that into it
 
03:33:40.330 --> 03:33:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
all right I'm just trying to land this
 
03:33:43.380 --> 03:33:44.290 align:start position:0%

03:33:44.300 --> 03:33:48.370 align:start position:0%
airplane
right

03:33:48.370 --> 03:33:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:56.929 --> 03:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:56.939 --> 03:34:05.570 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:34:05.570 --> 03:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:18.490 --> 03:34:18.500 align:start position:0%

03:34:30.779 --> 03:34:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:41.760 --> 03:35:49.450 align:start position:0%

03:36:31.620 --> 03:36:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:36:59.210 --> 03:36:59.220 align:start position:0%

03:37:44.690 --> 03:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
and into people on to be blocked
 
03:37:47.450 --> 03:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
if it's just under the current metering
 
03:37:49.969 --> 03:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
concert you open it up
 
03:37:52.190 --> 03:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
sites that would be better under this
 
03:37:54.370 --> 03:37:54.380 align:start position:0%
but for the ratepayers
 
03:37:56.870 --> 03:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
as well because there's problems with
 
03:37:59.450 --> 03:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
the lettering or net metering is just
 
03:38:02.090 --> 03:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
don't really know what the long that Dan
 
03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
can speak to this you you don't have
 
03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:06.889 align:start position:0%
can speak to this you you don't have
necessarily

03:38:06.889 --> 03:38:06.899 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
03:38:19.450 --> 03:38:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:23.889 --> 03:38:23.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is the entire training for these
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
size projects in a better it's a better
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
alternative for these size projects than
 
03:38:33.889 --> 03:38:33.899 align:start position:0%
trying to push them into the existing
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
net meter Wisconsin
 
03:38:38.530 --> 03:38:38.540 align:start position:0%
which quite obviously
 
03:38:40.490 --> 03:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
when I
 
03:38:40.500 --> 04:18:57.070 align:start position:0%
when I
um

04:18:57.070 --> 04:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.610 --> 04:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:18:58.620 --> 04:19:00.610 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

04:19:00.610 --> 04:19:00.620 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:19:02.990 --> 04:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay everyone please take your seats
 
04:19:05.410 --> 04:19:05.420 align:start position:0%
it's 1 16. I'd like to resume
 
04:19:09.170 --> 04:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate Bill 166 we
 
04:19:10.729 --> 04:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
have one person
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
who remains to be heard from and that's
 
04:19:15.290 --> 04:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
Henry Herndon
 
04:19:15.300 --> 04:19:17.330 align:start position:0%
Henry Herndon
uh

04:19:17.330 --> 04:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:19.130 --> 04:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
who used to be
 
04:19:20.929 --> 04:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
representing someone else but now is
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
representing himself I guess so Henry
 
04:19:25.790 --> 04:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
welcome aboard and uh please give us
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
your perspective on Senate bill 166.
 
04:19:31.010 --> 04:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you members of
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I I am a consultant here in the state
 
04:19:36.170 --> 04:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
and I had the privilege of actually
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
working with this Committee in 2021 when
 
04:19:42.650 --> 04:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
House Bill 315 moved forward and really
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
made the community power act uh viable
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and realistic for the state and I'm
 
04:19:49.969 --> 04:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
pleased to sort of report to you all
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
today that
 
04:19:53.929 --> 04:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
um the fruits of that good legislation
 
04:19:55.550 --> 04:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
that good collaborative bipartisan
 
04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
legislation are coming to fruition we're
 
04:20:00.410 --> 04:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
seeing Community power programs launch
 
04:20:02.150 --> 04:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
all across the state just with the
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
Coalition Community power Coalition of
 
04:20:06.530 --> 04:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire 10 programs are currently
 
04:20:10.010 --> 04:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
going live and we'll be saving tens of
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
thousands of granite Staters tens of
 
04:20:13.849 --> 04:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars annually on their
 
04:20:17.389 --> 04:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
electricity Supply costs so that is all
 
04:20:18.650 --> 04:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
as a result of the good work of this
 
04:20:21.050 --> 04:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
committee and the collaborative process
 
04:20:21.060 --> 04:20:22.090 align:start position:0%
committee and the collaborative process
there

04:20:22.090 --> 04:20:22.100 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:20:22.100 --> 04:20:23.689 align:start position:0%
there
and

04:20:23.689 --> 04:20:23.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:26.210 --> 04:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
um I want to I'd like to sort of clarify
 
04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
I hope some of the discussion around the
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
pilots and the projects and what are the
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
options before this committee with
 
04:20:36.410 --> 04:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
regard specifically to section five and
 
04:20:39.110 --> 04:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
section uh sorry section six and section
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
seven of this bill on page four
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
um we have heard discussion about
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
pilot projects of up to five megawatts
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard discussion of Monopoly
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
utility projects of the same sort and
 
04:20:53.689 --> 04:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
we've heard discussion of a potential
 
04:20:55.969 --> 04:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
Marketplace for developing those same
 
04:20:57.530 --> 04:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
projects and I think these are sort of
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
the three Pathways available to the
 
04:21:02.210 --> 04:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
committee and I'll try to sort of share
 
04:21:04.250 --> 04:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
some I hope helpful context and then
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
answer questions about
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
um a path pot potentially forward
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
um the bill I think it does a great job
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
of laying out the framework and then
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's about sort of what can be done now
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
to directly build on the good progress
 
04:21:18.650 --> 04:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
of things like the the competitive
 
04:21:20.689 --> 04:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
market expansion under Community power
 
04:21:20.699 --> 04:21:22.670 align:start position:0%
market expansion under Community power
and

04:21:22.670 --> 04:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:22.680 --> 04:21:23.330 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:21:23.330 --> 04:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:25.130 --> 04:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
I mentioned some of the cost savings
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in these cities and towns
 
04:21:30.650 --> 04:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
Supply rates drop from 20 cents for
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
eversource or 26 Cents for Unitil all
 
04:21:35.570 --> 04:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
the way down to below 16 cents in some
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
cases as low as 12 cents in some of
 
04:21:39.530 --> 04:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
these communities so dramatic savings
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
twenty to fifty dollars a month per
 
04:21:41.760 --> 04:21:42.889 align:start position:0%
twenty to fifty dollars a month per
customer

04:21:42.889 --> 04:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
customer
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
and what the technical analysis from
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
Community power Coalition has found is
 
04:21:50.809 --> 04:21:50.819 align:start position:0%
that while this new community power
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
structure creates cost savings
 
04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
it can further create cost savings if it
 
04:21:58.969 --> 04:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
is able to contract directly within
 
04:22:01.550 --> 04:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
State generators under five megawatts if
 
04:22:03.650 --> 04:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
we can contract with those generators we
 
04:22:05.689 --> 04:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
can realize further cost Savings in a
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
competitive market structure so
 
04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
we there's not really a disagreement on
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
the value as was described by Clifton
 
04:22:14.399 --> 04:22:15.950 align:start position:0%
the value as was described by Clifton
below

04:22:15.950 --> 04:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
below
 
04:22:18.050 --> 04:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
um you know Unitil has proposed a very
 
04:22:20.210 --> 04:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
similar project realizing all of the
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
same benefits
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
avoided wholesale energy cost avoided
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
wholesale capacity cost avoided
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
transmission costs avoided ancillary
 
04:22:29.570 --> 04:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
Services costs we understand all of
 
04:22:32.090 --> 04:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
these values can be realized utilities
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
are to their credit proposing these
 
04:22:36.410 --> 04:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
projects to move forward under sort of a
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
utility monopoly-centric approach which
 
04:22:41.630 --> 04:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
I I think is good because it's you know
 
04:22:44.450 --> 04:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
one Avenue to develop these projects
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
what the opportunity that is before this
 
04:22:50.210 --> 04:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
committee is to allow both utilities and
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
Market actors to implement the same
 
04:22:55.370 --> 04:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
kinds of projects to realize benefits so
 
04:22:56.689 --> 04:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
really the question I think the question
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
this committee often struggles with is
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
when do we have monopolies do things
 
04:23:02.150 --> 04:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
when do we have Market actors do things
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
which one is more efficient when and and
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
how can we sort of set the right
 
04:23:08.450 --> 04:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
structures and the opportunity with this
 
04:23:10.490 --> 04:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill is to create in addition to the
 
04:23:12.290 --> 04:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
Monopoly structure for one to five
 
04:23:14.570 --> 04:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
megawatt projects a market-based
 
04:23:16.370 --> 04:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
structure where Community power programs
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
can do the same projects competitive
 
04:23:20.330 --> 04:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
suppliers can do the same projects and
 
04:23:22.370 --> 04:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
basically you do you do the math the
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
same way and you let the marketplace
 
04:23:26.929 --> 04:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
realize those benefits across the state
 
04:23:26.939 --> 04:23:28.429 align:start position:0%
realize those benefits across the state
so

04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:28.439 --> 04:23:30.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.469 --> 04:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's I think the question and
 
04:23:34.969 --> 04:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
um I know I'm in support of this bill
 
04:23:37.490 --> 04:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of potentially
 
04:23:39.769 --> 04:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
a collaborative process to amend the
 
04:23:42.590 --> 04:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
bill I remember sort of uh
 
04:23:45.050 --> 04:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
it was exciting a couple of years ago to
 
04:23:46.610 --> 04:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
see this very collaborative project
 
04:23:48.650 --> 04:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
process led by the chairman to bring
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
together Market actors non-profits local
 
04:23:53.450 --> 04:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
cities and towns utility companies and
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
sort of how do we flesh out public
 
04:23:56.689 --> 04:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
policy that that meets all of those
 
04:23:58.610 --> 04:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
interests it seems that there may be an
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for some sort of work
 
04:24:02.510 --> 04:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
session on this bill which has a lot of
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
potential but I don't it's kind of clear
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's not fully fleshed out as of
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
yet as to exactly how do we allow for
 
04:24:12.370 --> 04:24:12.380 align:start position:0%
these projects do we say hey utility
 
04:24:15.590 --> 04:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
voluntarily you can build these pilots
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
on a one-off basis if you'd like to do
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
we say utilities can build these
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
projects and allow Market actors to
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
propose them
 
04:24:24.410 --> 04:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
um those questions seem slightly
 
04:24:25.849 --> 04:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
unresolved and the legislation has
 
04:24:25.859 --> 04:24:26.950 align:start position:0%
unresolved and the legislation has
drafted

04:24:26.950 --> 04:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
04:24:28.969 --> 04:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
and I think that's really the decision
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee so I can I can conclude
 
04:24:32.689 --> 04:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
my remarks there and I'd be happy to
 
04:24:34.250 --> 04:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
answer questions and particularly with
 
04:24:37.729 --> 04:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
these interest in understanding like how
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
these look why these are valuable what
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
is transmission avoided cost and you
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
know how how is that realized through
 
04:24:48.290 --> 04:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
these projects I could speak to that or
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
I could speak to any other questions the
 
04:24:52.849 --> 04:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
committee may have thank you
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nader has a
 
04:24:57.290 --> 04:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
question yeah just for the record um how
 
04:24:58.490 --> 04:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
do you spell your name I couldn't read
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
your writing oh uh it's Henry h-e-n-r-y
 
04:25:07.849 --> 04:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.330 --> 04:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and by the way to the rest of
 
04:25:13.189 --> 04:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
the committee thanks to representative
 
04:25:16.130 --> 04:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
Nutter today for filling in for our
 
04:25:19.010 --> 04:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
clerk who is obviously not here today JD
 
04:25:21.290 --> 04:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
Bernardi he uh had
 
04:25:23.150 --> 04:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
a private business that he had to attend
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
to today
 
04:25:24.840 --> 04:25:26.030 align:start position:0%
to today
okay

04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:25:28.370 --> 04:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Herndon representative
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas
 
04:25:31.490 --> 04:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:25:33.290 --> 04:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
um you said you'd be willing to work on
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment specifically what aspect
 
04:25:37.790 --> 04:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
would you like to see amended is that
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:25:45.170 --> 04:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
um there's been materials proposed by
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
Clifton below there's the the language
 
04:25:49.250 --> 04:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
that is currently in this in section six
 
04:25:51.410 --> 04:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
and seven and
 
04:25:51.420 --> 04:25:52.070 align:start position:0%
and seven and
um

04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:53.870 --> 04:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
I think that yes that is what would need
 
04:25:55.250 --> 04:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
to be fleshed out I don't have specific
 
04:25:56.689 --> 04:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
language for you right now but I think
 
04:25:58.429 --> 04:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
it is a question of
 
04:26:01.910 --> 04:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
shall we allow a very limited voluntary
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
number of Pilots shall we require a
 
04:26:06.530 --> 04:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
certain number of Pilots or shall we
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
open a Marketplace to allow
 
04:26:12.050 --> 04:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
Market actors to propose and develop
 
04:26:13.910 --> 04:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
projects and I would recommend that
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
third option is actually the best public
 
04:26:18.050 --> 04:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
policy you want to avoid a death by
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
Pilot situation
 
04:26:22.010 --> 04:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
um where you know you have these Pilots
 
04:26:23.570 --> 04:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
they drag on in regulatory bodies for
 
04:26:25.189 --> 04:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
year after year and and they they
 
04:26:26.689 --> 04:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't get to the Finish
 
04:26:26.699 --> 04:26:28.070 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't get to the Finish
Line

04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
Line
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
um the committee's been successful in
 
04:26:31.309 --> 04:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
the past at implementing good public
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
policy that creates real value like the
 
04:26:35.090 --> 04:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of savings that
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
Community power is currently generating
 
04:26:40.370 --> 04:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
and I think a sort of open a Marketplace
 
04:26:43.010 --> 04:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
Third Road as opposed to restricted
 
04:26:45.410 --> 04:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
Pilots Road uh that would be my
 
04:26:46.729 --> 04:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
recommendation but that's obviously
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
something for the committee to to
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
deliberate thank you I follow up I have
 
04:26:52.849 --> 04:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
a follow-up but it's actually for
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters
 
04:26:59.450 --> 04:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:01.309 --> 04:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
Senator waters are you prepared to
 
04:27:04.010 --> 04:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
answer a question for
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay hold it until after he's done all
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
right representative Corman has a
 
04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:27:14.269 --> 04:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
Mr Herndon for taking my question so
 
04:27:16.729 --> 04:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
as you said if Community power can can
 
04:27:19.250 --> 04:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
contract with small generators that can
 
04:27:21.889 --> 04:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
actually produce even more savings and
 
04:27:23.570 --> 04:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
as I understand it a lot of these
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
savings would be due to reduced
 
04:27:28.370 --> 04:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
transmission costs so I live in Lebanon
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm actually about to go on community
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
power very happily so if Community power
 
04:27:37.729 --> 04:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon were to contract with a
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
supplier near Lebanon then presumably
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
the transmission cost is
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
saved or reduced but if they were to
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
contract with the supplier in say Berlin
 
04:27:49.969 --> 04:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
would there still be the transmission
 
04:27:52.090 --> 04:27:52.100 align:start position:0%
costs and would that limit how much
 
04:27:54.769 --> 04:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Community power could save
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
the transmission cost would be reduced
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
if the generator produces power at the
 
04:28:04.610 --> 04:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
hour of the month at which transmission
 
04:28:07.370 --> 04:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
load is highest and that's measured and
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
that's pretty simple calculation looking
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
backwards what hour of this month was
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
the peak transmission load did Generator
 
04:28:16.429 --> 04:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
X produce power at that hour of Time how
 
04:28:19.010 --> 04:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
much power that's how much less cost so
 
04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's the calculation and really the
 
04:28:22.969 --> 04:28:22.979 align:start position:0%
the factor is not whether it's in
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
Lebanon or not I believe it is whether
 
04:28:26.929 --> 04:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
it is interconnected into the same
 
04:28:29.630 --> 04:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
utility company's distribution grid so
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
if if the generator is plugged into the
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
Liberty Utilities distribution grid
 
04:28:37.250 --> 04:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
beneath the transmission grid then it
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
could if generating power at the time of
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
peak transmission cost it would reduce
 
04:28:43.969 --> 04:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
those costs directly and that's very
 
04:28:48.530 --> 04:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.050 --> 04:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
04:28:52.610 --> 04:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
04:28:54.889 --> 04:28:54.899 align:start position:0%
Herndon for taking my question I think
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
it might be helpful for the committee if
 
04:29:00.649 --> 04:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
you uh entered into an exercise to try
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
and help us understand how pilot
 
04:29:04.849 --> 04:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
projects are being used within this bill
 
04:29:04.859 --> 04:29:06.469 align:start position:0%
projects are being used within this bill
because

04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:29:09.050 --> 04:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
um I think they're you know the word
 
04:29:10.610 --> 04:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
pilot seems to be all things to all
 
04:29:10.620 --> 04:29:12.110 align:start position:0%
pilot seems to be all things to all
people

04:29:12.110 --> 04:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:29:15.050 --> 04:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
um there's a specific reference to
 
04:29:17.689 --> 04:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
utility Pilots but then there's places
 
04:29:20.450 --> 04:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
where it just says pilot and it seems to
 
04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
be a bit of a contention so if you could
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
just clarify for us what we're talking
 
04:29:24.729 --> 04:29:24.739 align:start position:0%
about here
 
04:29:26.689 --> 04:29:26.699 align:start position:0%
pilots and projects are not
 
04:29:28.490 --> 04:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
interchangeable correct
 
04:29:30.889 --> 04:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and and no they
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're not interchangeable
 
04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
um and I'll sort of recall what the
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the Department of energy
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
said about well if you have multiple
 
04:29:39.290 --> 04:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
projects they're no longer a pilot and
 
04:29:41.149 --> 04:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's he sort of seemed to view it as a
 
04:29:42.410 --> 04:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
bad thing
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and and I would I would posit that
 
04:29:46.370 --> 04:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
actually the opposite is true if you
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
know that value can be created by a
 
04:29:50.809 --> 04:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
project if you measure its production at
 
04:29:52.969 --> 04:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
a certain time why would we restrict
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
that value from being available to all
 
04:29:56.689 --> 04:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
customers in New Hampshire this is why I
 
04:29:57.889 --> 04:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
would propose to the committee that
 
04:30:00.370 --> 04:30:00.380 align:start position:0%
rather than piloting or studying this
 
04:30:02.570 --> 04:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
consider strongly the possibility of
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
allowing it through sort of the correct
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
authorizations through the Public
 
04:30:08.330 --> 04:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
Utility Commission to determine how do
 
04:30:11.450 --> 04:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
we calculate value but not restricting
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
it to only Pilots that could be
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
controlled by utilities or that
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
utilities might be able to sort of
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
have a hand in the timeline or the or
 
04:30:22.010 --> 04:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
the project development or that you know
 
04:30:23.330 --> 04:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
they could potentially obstruct those
 
04:30:23.340 --> 04:30:24.150 align:start position:0%
they could potentially obstruct those
projects

04:30:24.150 --> 04:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:30:24.160 --> 04:30:30.530 align:start position:0%
projects
[Music]

04:30:30.530 --> 04:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:32.210 --> 04:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
times on this committee we're concerned
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
with any type of unrestrained adoption
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
of anything in terms of the energy
 
04:30:39.889 --> 04:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
markets but um could you speak to if
 
04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.450 --> 04:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
in the supply
 
04:30:49.610 --> 04:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
whether that would help affect rates
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
because I think that's something we're
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
all concerned with
 
04:30:52.199 --> 04:30:53.389 align:start position:0%
all concerned with
yes

04:30:53.389 --> 04:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:30:53.399 --> 04:30:54.229 align:start position:0%
yes
um

04:30:54.229 --> 04:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:56.450 --> 04:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
so the way these projects would move
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
forward is a buyer and a seller would
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
negotiate a power purchase agreement how
 
04:31:01.849 --> 04:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
much do we want to buy so that's a
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
market price between two participants
 
04:31:05.809 --> 04:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
free of government intervention
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
and then you say if you do certain
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
things like lower transmission cost
 
04:31:12.110 --> 04:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay you for lowering this
 
04:31:14.210 --> 04:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
transmission costs now there's an
 
04:31:16.370 --> 04:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
incentive for Market actors to lower
 
04:31:18.349 --> 04:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
everyone in New Hampshire's electricity
 
04:31:22.370 --> 04:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
costs so again a key aspect of this
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
structure this Market market-based
 
04:31:26.050 --> 04:31:26.060 align:start position:0%
structure is there is no
 
04:31:27.950 --> 04:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
cross-subsidization this is not net
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
metering where the state is picking the
 
04:31:32.570 --> 04:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
price and paying the that that is paid
 
04:31:35.149 --> 04:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
out to the generator this is a negotiate
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
agreement with no possibility of
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
Shifting costs one way for or another
 
04:31:41.330 --> 04:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
but it does allow the possibility to
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
lower costs if they hit certain things
 
04:31:52.130 --> 04:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative munz did you have a
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
question no
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:32:03.290 --> 04:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
Henry is it
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
um inherent in your stated preference
 
04:32:07.439 --> 04:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
um inherent in your stated preference
for

04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
as you described at the the third option
 
04:32:15.050 --> 04:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
um for amending uh potentially amending
 
04:32:17.689 --> 04:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
section six and seven with reference to
 
04:32:20.030 --> 04:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
Pilots that
 
04:32:22.250 --> 04:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
do I am I correct that you were
 
04:32:22.260 --> 04:32:24.170 align:start position:0%
do I am I correct that you were
advocating

04:32:24.170 --> 04:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
advocating
 
04:32:26.750 --> 04:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know rather rather than allowing or
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
even requiring utilities to do one pilot
 
04:32:30.000 --> 04:32:31.010 align:start position:0%
even requiring utilities to do one pilot
each

04:32:31.010 --> 04:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
each
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh which would then give policy makers a
 
04:32:37.689 --> 04:32:37.699 align:start position:0%
limited set of
 
04:32:37.699 --> 04:32:39.290 align:start position:0%
limited set of
experiments

04:32:39.290 --> 04:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
experiments
 
04:32:43.130 --> 04:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
and data to inform future policy that
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying let there be more pilots
 
04:32:49.849 --> 04:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
let there be more experience and then
 
04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
policymakers could compare the results
 
04:32:54.889 --> 04:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
would have more they have a bigger data
 
04:32:58.250 --> 04:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
set from which to draw on
 
04:33:00.410 --> 04:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
making future policy
 
04:33:02.689 --> 04:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
yes I believe I am saying that and I'm
 
04:33:05.390 --> 04:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
saying that you know right now Unitil
 
04:33:07.730 --> 04:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
has proposed a very good project outside
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
of this construct and that's good and
 
04:33:10.670 --> 04:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
that should be allowed to move forward
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
and similarly we should allow projects
 
04:33:16.369 --> 04:33:16.379 align:start position:0%
to move forward to realize those same
 
04:33:17.810 --> 04:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
benefits for customers and have sort of
 
04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
an all of the above approach rather than
 
04:33:21.000 --> 04:33:21.769 align:start position:0%
an all of the above approach rather than
um

04:33:21.769 --> 04:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know really it's not a question of
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
should we allow utilities to do pilots
 
04:33:28.609 --> 04:33:28.619 align:start position:0%
it's a question of should we allow the
 
04:33:30.410 --> 04:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
market to develop cost-effective
 
04:33:30.420 --> 04:33:32.090 align:start position:0%
market to develop cost-effective
projects

04:33:32.090 --> 04:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:33:34.490 --> 04:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:37.369 --> 04:33:37.379 align:start position:0%
representative lowkey has a question uh
 
04:33:38.631 --> 04:33:38.641 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:33:41.810 --> 04:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about who the
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
generators are because presumably these
 
04:33:46.670 --> 04:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
would be dispatchable sources as opposed
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
to you know some of the Renewables and
 
04:33:54.289 --> 04:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
um why would these you know other
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
generators be cheaper than
 
04:34:00.170 --> 04:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
um the grid that's a very good question
 
04:34:00.180 --> 04:34:01.010 align:start position:0%
um the grid that's a very good question
um

04:34:01.010 --> 04:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
in the Unitil example you know they've
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
they've proposed this tracker to follow
 
04:34:10.010 --> 04:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
the sun right and and so you solve for
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
this issue of let's just have Solar
 
04:34:12.240 --> 04:34:13.310 align:start position:0%
this issue of let's just have Solar
without

04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:34:15.769 --> 04:34:15.779 align:start position:0%
caring when it's producing power so you
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
create an incentive where the project in
 
04:34:19.609 --> 04:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
Lebanon for example it could have a
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
landfill gas to energy power plant that
 
04:34:22.970 --> 04:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
could be this that would be a
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
dispatchable resource or you could have
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
a developer say oh I'm gonna get paid
 
04:34:30.170 --> 04:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
for lowering transmission cost if I
 
04:34:32.631 --> 04:34:32.641 align:start position:0%
attach a battery to my solar array and I
 
04:34:34.730 --> 04:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
dispatch that battery once a month on
 
04:34:36.650 --> 04:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
the transmission cost so you leave it to
 
04:34:38.750 --> 04:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
the market to say we created the
 
04:34:41.090 --> 04:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
incentive hit these monthly transmission
 
04:34:43.609 --> 04:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
Peaks and let the market figure out what
 
04:34:46.010 --> 04:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
resource or project is best equipped for
 
04:34:46.020 --> 04:34:47.631 align:start position:0%
resource or project is best equipped for
that

04:34:47.631 --> 04:34:47.641 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.570 --> 04:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
the committee I want to thank you for
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
being here to testify and then I'll
 
04:35:03.051 --> 04:35:03.061 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing finally Mr
 
04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
chair I had that question for the
 
04:35:07.310 --> 04:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
senator oh that's right okay I forgot
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
about that thank you so Senator waters
 
04:35:13.310 --> 04:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
before we start on 167 can you answer
 
04:35:15.289 --> 04:35:15.299 align:start position:0%
representative I'll Trust these
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I think you can
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
answer this
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
um so much of the discussion today has
 
04:35:22.369 --> 04:35:22.379 align:start position:0%
been on the definition of pilot programs
 
04:35:24.769 --> 04:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
and and modifying and amending the
 
04:35:27.170 --> 04:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
language when this was presented in the
 
04:35:29.689 --> 04:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
Senate was there pushback or discussion
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
on the pilot program issue or is this a
 
04:35:33.769 --> 04:35:33.779 align:start position:0%
house specific issue
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question you betcha
 
04:35:37.250 --> 04:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
there was discussion and that's why we
 
04:35:39.769 --> 04:35:39.779 align:start position:0%
ended up where we ended and why we got
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
the ever source to say they were pretty
 
04:35:44.689 --> 04:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
happy who they ended up because there's
 
04:35:46.849 --> 04:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of negotiating over that and doe
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
got itself to neutral on it my advice on
 
04:35:50.219 --> 04:35:51.109 align:start position:0%
got itself to neutral on it my advice on
this

04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:35:53.209 --> 04:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
um basically I don't I don't think
 
04:35:54.410 --> 04:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
there's any disagreement on maybe
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
needing to tweak the pilots a little bit
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
so they'll work better in the
 
04:35:58.730 --> 04:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
marketplace and the side nobody's
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
complained about moving the size of the
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
project a little bit I think the
 
04:36:03.890 --> 04:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:36:05.631 --> 04:36:05.641 align:start position:0%
um on how many
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a way to work with
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
doe and others to to kind of figure out
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
something in between on that
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
um let me just a little context too the
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
wisdom of this committee and
 
04:36:18.650 --> 04:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
particularly your chair in the way we
 
04:36:22.250 --> 04:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
got to compromise on 315 and 165 you
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
know a few years ago was to use this
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
pilot concept as a way to help the
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
marketplace but also understand what
 
04:36:30.529 --> 04:36:30.539 align:start position:0%
we're doing as we're setting policy and
 
04:36:33.170 --> 04:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
I and I I think that was a that was a
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
good move so
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
um I think that within the framework
 
04:36:37.970 --> 04:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
there I think we can make some
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
adjustments in the bill I don't see a
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
lot of disagreement frankly over this
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's a Way Forward I do think from what
 
04:36:45.890 --> 04:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
we've heard we're going to be coming
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
back to this issue and trying to do more
 
04:36:50.449 --> 04:36:50.459 align:start position:0%
as things evolve but for now I think
 
04:36:52.010 --> 04:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
there's a kind of a good little
 
04:36:54.289 --> 04:36:54.299 align:start position:0%
compromise available here thank you very
 
04:36:54.299 --> 04:36:56.330 align:start position:0%
compromise available here thank you very
much

04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:36:56.340 --> 04:36:57.349 align:start position:0%
much
okay

04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
now we can say we're officially done
 
04:37:01.730 --> 04:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
with Senate bill 166.
 
04:37:04.189 --> 04:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
and so we will move on to Senate bill
 
04:37:04.199 --> 04:37:06.170 align:start position:0%
and so we will move on to Senate bill
167.

04:37:06.170 --> 04:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
167.
 
04:37:08.810 --> 04:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
and I'll open that public hearing and
 
04:37:11.449 --> 04:37:11.459 align:start position:0%
recognize Senator David Waters Prime
 
04:37:13.849 --> 04:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill to speak to us about
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
this bill Senator Waters thank you very
 
04:37:16.849 --> 04:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman members of the
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
committee Senator David Waters District
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
4 introducing Senate Bill 167 relative
 
04:37:23.929 --> 04:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
to Green hydrogen energy and
 
04:37:23.939 --> 04:37:26.090 align:start position:0%
to Green hydrogen energy and
infrastructure

04:37:26.090 --> 04:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:37:29.631 --> 04:37:29.641 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh I put together with a
 
04:37:31.730 --> 04:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
lot of help from other people to make a
 
04:37:34.609 --> 04:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
bad pun when we're getting to power uh
 
04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
many hands make the lights work and uh
 
04:37:39.769 --> 04:37:39.779 align:start position:0%
so here I wanted to be sure that as this
 
04:37:41.631 --> 04:37:41.641 align:start position:0%
emerging industry comes forward and this
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
this fuel source that New Hampshire is
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
open for business
 
04:37:46.570 --> 04:37:46.580 align:start position:0%
um I think hydrogen has a great
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
possibility of reducing our energy costs
 
04:37:53.090 --> 04:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
and promoting uh Economic Development
 
04:37:56.209 --> 04:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
there is major industry investment
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
coming into the hydrogen space as the
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
cost of electrolyzing is expected to
 
04:38:07.369 --> 04:38:07.379 align:start position:0%
drop fast in the next few years and I
 
04:38:09.289 --> 04:38:09.299 align:start position:0%
think that we see the great potential of
 
04:38:13.369 --> 04:38:13.379 align:start position:0%
what hydrogen uh can can do
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
um uh and I just mentioned uh in terms
 
04:38:18.170 --> 04:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
of other support for this the
 
04:38:21.051 --> 04:38:21.061 align:start position:0%
Transportation Act included 7.1 billion
 
04:38:23.929 --> 04:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
dollars for pilot programs related to
 
04:38:26.209 --> 04:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
hydrogen infrastructure
 
04:38:27.890 --> 04:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
um most of the all the New England
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
states except for New Hampshire and
 
04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:33.299 align:start position:0%
uh Mid-Atlantic coaster and a Consortium
 
04:38:36.051 --> 04:38:36.061 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is considering the
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
governor's considering joining that
 
04:38:38.929 --> 04:38:38.939 align:start position:0%
Consortium might help us leverage some
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
of that 7.1 billion dollars there also
 
04:38:44.269 --> 04:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
are tens of billions of dollars for
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
hydrogen infrastructure development in
 
04:38:48.529 --> 04:38:48.539 align:start position:0%
the ira Act
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
major investments in r d stackable tax
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
credits up to 36 percent for projects
 
04:38:58.369 --> 04:38:58.379 align:start position:0%
and a price guarantee for hydrogen
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
um particularly important to Hampshire
 
04:39:01.970 --> 04:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
is that those those kinds of fundings
 
04:39:03.769 --> 04:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
might be available for New Generation
 
04:39:06.170 --> 04:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
yes but also for replacement existing
 
04:39:08.330 --> 04:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
generation that that's something that's
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
important for us also great potential in
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
Marine hydrogen
 
04:39:16.250 --> 04:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
Transportation hydrogen I suspect our
 
04:39:18.769 --> 04:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
heavy truck Fleet is more likely to go
 
04:39:20.990 --> 04:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
hydrogen than it is electrification
 
04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
we'll see but there is a lot of money
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
available for transportation hubs for
 
04:39:29.929 --> 04:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
hydrogen fueling then of most importance
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
to me in terms of offshore wind is
 
04:39:34.609 --> 04:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
offshore wind is likely to use hydrogen
 
04:39:37.310 --> 04:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
as a Storage Fuel producing it at the
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
turbine site and using it as a Storage
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
Fuel that can then be put to generation
 
04:39:46.368 --> 04:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
or industrial or other usage
 
04:39:49.130 --> 04:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
in this bill I Look to Montana to
 
04:39:52.010 --> 04:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
Illinois some of the western states as
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
to what they're trying to do about it
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I tried to put together a bill which
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
I thought would
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know kind of be right for New
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and get us into a regulatory
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
and tax framework where we could get
 
04:40:06.430 --> 04:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
some of this major investment into
 
04:40:10.250 --> 04:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
our our state so we're turning to the
 
04:40:10.260 --> 04:40:10.910 align:start position:0%
our our state so we're turning to the
bill

04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:40:12.350 --> 04:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
you know I summarize some of the
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
findings some of the things I've just uh
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
just said
 
04:40:18.170 --> 04:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
um and then uh importantly here
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
um the definitions again using what
 
04:40:21.410 --> 04:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
other states have used you see green
 
04:40:21.420 --> 04:40:23.030 align:start position:0%
other states have used you see green
hydrogen

04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
hydrogen
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
um here it's not just the gas itself but
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
also the associated clean energy
 
04:40:31.010 --> 04:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
generation fuel cells transmission other
 
04:40:32.570 --> 04:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so we'll get the whole
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
project involved with um with hydrogen
 
04:40:37.250 --> 04:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see the definition
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
starting online
 
04:40:38.878 --> 04:40:40.190 align:start position:0%
starting online
20

04:40:40.190 --> 04:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
20
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
. um
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
in a manner that produces zero carbon
 
04:40:48.410 --> 04:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
and x and co-pollutant Emissions using
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
hydrogen fuel is electrolyzed using 100
 
04:40:52.130 --> 04:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
zero carbon
 
04:40:56.090 --> 04:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
emission energy source this definition
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
has been very carefully crafted to make
 
04:40:59.948 --> 04:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
sure that it includes
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
Seabrook using its excess steam perhaps
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
to produce hydrogen which is a real
 
04:41:07.850 --> 04:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
option down there and then I think
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
importantly because of some anxieties
 
04:41:11.810 --> 04:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
people feel about the relationship of
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
hydrogens and natural gas note here
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
um that it does not include producing
 
04:41:22.610 --> 04:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
hydrogen from fossil fuel feedstock
 
04:41:23.930 --> 04:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see a little bit further
 
04:41:23.940 --> 04:41:24.708 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see a little bit further
along

04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
along
 
04:41:26.930 --> 04:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
um green hydrogen facility they're going
 
04:41:29.690 --> 04:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
to cut rather expansive definition and
 
04:41:32.570 --> 04:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
then the following from that onto page
 
04:41:32.580 --> 04:41:34.730 align:start position:0%
then the following from that onto page
two

04:41:34.730 --> 04:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:41:36.730 --> 04:41:36.740 align:start position:0%
um the other aspects of it I will
 
04:41:40.128 --> 04:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
highlight on line one storage
 
04:41:42.770 --> 04:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
that is going to be an important part of
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
these projects I uh I believe and
 
04:41:48.288 --> 04:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
regenerative fuel cells too all these
 
04:41:51.650 --> 04:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.448 --> 04:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
um then you'll see in the middle of page
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
two there is a tax credit program here
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
against the business profit tax
 
04:42:05.448 --> 04:42:05.458 align:start position:0%
I developed this like our r d tax credit
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
um and we do this in other areas and it
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
seemed like a short-term incentive given
 
04:42:14.510 --> 04:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
the enormous benefits for us in terms of
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
energy and economic development and jobs
 
04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
that this seemed appropriate I am
 
04:42:23.150 --> 04:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
grateful to um Mr Wong from dra for
 
04:42:26.090 --> 04:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
helping to work on this language he does
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
you know since we passed in the Senate I
 
04:42:29.930 --> 04:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
think we need to just change slightly
 
04:42:32.810 --> 04:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
how the tax credit is managed to make it
 
04:42:34.010 --> 04:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
even more like the research and
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
development tax credit and I've sent
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
that to electronically but I have copies
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
of that that here
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I should mention at this point the
 
04:42:43.490 --> 04:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
physical null because
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know the physical note uh says that
 
04:42:49.250 --> 04:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay get a tax credit program however
 
04:42:52.910 --> 04:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
the potential new revenues for building
 
04:42:54.470 --> 04:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
this infrastructure could be quite
 
04:42:56.690 --> 04:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
substantial so the physical note says
 
04:42:58.610 --> 04:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's basically a wash as far as they can
 
04:43:00.288 --> 04:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
tell at this point and that's why it
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
came through the through the Senate the
 
04:43:04.128 --> 04:43:04.138 align:start position:0%
way uh that it did after going to our
 
04:43:04.138 --> 04:43:05.208 align:start position:0%
way uh that it did after going to our
finance

04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
finance
 
04:43:07.850 --> 04:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
um finance committee
 
04:43:10.730 --> 04:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
and then guess what another advisory
 
04:43:10.740 --> 04:43:12.230 align:start position:0%
and then guess what another advisory
committee

04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
and we've talked about that before and
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
let me talk about why
 
04:43:18.590 --> 04:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
um this is important here
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
um it we need a green hydrogen advisory
 
04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
committee in the department of injury to
 
04:43:25.190 --> 04:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
do a number of things and these are the
 
04:43:28.670 --> 04:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
people to do it on line 32 let me note
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
that Josh Elliott says we we probably
 
04:43:33.890 --> 04:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
need to um add or designee and the
 
04:43:36.350 --> 04:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
amendment does that on line 32 so that
 
04:43:38.330 --> 04:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
it could be the designee of the site
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
04:43:40.560 --> 04:43:41.150 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
um

04:43:41.150 --> 04:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:44.690 --> 04:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
on that and then its duties
 
04:43:48.410 --> 04:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:48.420 --> 04:43:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:51.770 --> 04:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at other existing
 
04:43:53.810 --> 04:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws and Regulation
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
and funding and so they can recommend to
 
04:43:58.970 --> 04:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
us some things that we might need
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
further to do
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
um what are further opportunities to
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
integrate green hydrogen Transportation
 
04:44:07.490 --> 04:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
energy Industrial in other sectors what
 
04:44:07.500 --> 04:44:08.590 align:start position:0%
energy Industrial in other sectors what
barriers

04:44:08.590 --> 04:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
barriers
 
04:44:12.250 --> 04:44:12.260 align:start position:0%
may may still exist in statute
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
and then on lines eight through ten
 
04:44:19.490 --> 04:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
um here consider a plan to create
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
support develop a partner with a
 
04:44:24.830 --> 04:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hub in this state under Federal
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
funding provisions and determine how to
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
maximize federal financial incentives
 
04:44:31.970 --> 04:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
support Hub development so as I said the
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
governor is considering this Mark
 
04:44:38.330 --> 04:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
Sanborn of Des is kind of championing
 
04:44:40.730 --> 04:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
this aspect of the of the bills so that
 
04:44:42.890 --> 04:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
we can leverage New Hampshire perhaps in
 
04:44:44.930 --> 04:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
cooperation real estates to get more
 
04:44:47.330 --> 04:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
funding that's available from the
 
04:44:49.930 --> 04:44:49.940 align:start position:0%
federal sources
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
and then um you know in terms of
 
04:44:55.490 --> 04:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
construction of potential pipelines or
 
04:44:57.410 --> 04:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
other otherwise I'll tell you what I was
 
04:44:58.730 --> 04:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
thinking there if we're bringing in
 
04:45:01.250 --> 04:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
hydrogen off of offshore wind
 
04:45:03.708 --> 04:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
um we might want to be able to get that
 
04:45:03.718 --> 04:45:05.350 align:start position:0%
um we might want to be able to get that
to

04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
Marine hydrogen terminal because the
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
Marine vessels are going to hydrogen we
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
might want to get that to
 
04:45:13.970 --> 04:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
get the hydrogen out to
 
04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
um we're 95 and 16 come together to have
 
04:45:19.070 --> 04:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
an interstate fueling stop for trucks
 
04:45:20.990 --> 04:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to get over to peas
 
04:45:23.150 --> 04:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
because they rely on some backup
 
04:45:25.010 --> 04:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
generation down at Granite Shore power
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is now run off of jet fuel and this
 
04:45:29.650 --> 04:45:29.660 align:start position:0%
would be a whole lot cheaper and and uh
 
04:45:33.050 --> 04:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
more environmentally friendly so that's
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
um what I was looking at there and then
 
04:45:36.410 --> 04:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
I did want to point out lines 14 to 17
 
04:45:38.090 --> 04:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
because here that
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know that kind of anxiety people
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
have about fossil fuel feed stock and um
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
let me just note that under federal
 
04:45:45.240 --> 04:45:47.448 align:start position:0%
let me just note that under federal
statute

04:45:47.448 --> 04:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
it is permissible to mix up to 20
 
04:45:53.208 --> 04:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
percent of hydrogen into natural gas
 
04:45:54.530 --> 04:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:45:57.410 --> 04:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
and that is one of the projects from
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
that hydrogen Hub that's been proposed
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
including Liberty Utilities for Upstate
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
New York and it looks like they're going
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
to get a maybe 1.3 billion dollars for
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
that there's some potential of mixing
 
04:46:09.288 --> 04:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
some hydrogen into natural gas to help a
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
factory out in Keene a lot of new
 
04:46:13.368 --> 04:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
turbines today are developed that they
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
can run in hydrogen or natural gas or
 
04:46:19.490 --> 04:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
combination of the both so that's why I
 
04:46:21.050 --> 04:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
thought it was important to have have
 
04:46:22.430 --> 04:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
this in there because this is something
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
people are doing it's something that you
 
04:46:26.810 --> 04:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
know we've got to that is of interest
 
04:46:29.090 --> 04:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
and I thought having it here would be a
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
would be a good place for that that
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
issue to get get uh uh talked about
 
04:46:35.400 --> 04:46:36.288 align:start position:0%
issue to get get uh uh talked about
um

04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
and then a little bit further on I think
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
always important line 22
 
04:46:42.770 --> 04:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
um what is this all about yes about
 
04:46:44.448 --> 04:46:44.458 align:start position:0%
economic development jobs and all that
 
04:46:46.490 --> 04:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
but it's the long-term interest of rate
 
04:46:50.690 --> 04:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
payers cost effectively avoids or defers
 
04:46:53.030 --> 04:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
distribution system costs I think that's
 
04:46:55.128 --> 04:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
a pretty rock-solid principle that
 
04:46:56.810 --> 04:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
whatever we're doing energy space has to
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
be cost effective and serve
 
04:47:02.200 --> 04:47:02.210 align:start position:0%
um uh the the rate the rate payers
 
04:47:02.210 --> 04:47:02.570 align:start position:0%
um uh the the rate the rate payers
[Music]

04:47:02.570 --> 04:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:02.580 --> 04:47:04.250 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:47:04.250 --> 04:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:08.448 --> 04:47:08.458 align:start position:0%
and uh so then at the bottom of the page
 
04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
um I turn to the issue of regular State
 
04:47:11.340 --> 04:47:13.250 align:start position:0%
um I turn to the issue of regular State
regulation

04:47:13.250 --> 04:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
04:47:17.570 --> 04:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
and um I don't think our state is quite
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
an existing structure hydrogen
 
04:47:24.650 --> 04:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
like other gases is under the purview of
 
04:47:27.170 --> 04:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
the local fire marshal
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it's hard for me to imagine that a
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
local fire marshal
 
04:47:34.128 --> 04:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
um could have the expertise the
 
04:47:36.770 --> 04:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
understanding or the capacity to deal
 
04:47:39.530 --> 04:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
with what might be a major power plant I
 
04:47:42.770 --> 04:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
mean let's say you know Merrimack
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
station gets replaced by hydrogen
 
04:47:49.490 --> 04:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
um big big project or at the Seacoast or
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
elsewhere you know big project so this
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
is why I bring the State Fire Marshal in
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
here anything under 20 megawatts sure
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
locals could handle that but if you're
 
04:48:00.770 --> 04:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
doing the big project
 
04:48:02.330 --> 04:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
it really ought to it really ought to be
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshal will have the
 
04:48:07.250 --> 04:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
capacity to uh review
 
04:48:10.850 --> 04:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
um review review that uh and then lastly
 
04:48:12.410 --> 04:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little bit of language that
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
implements the uh tax credit so
 
04:48:17.570 --> 04:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
um I think enormous opportunity for the
 
04:48:17.580 --> 04:48:18.948 align:start position:0%
um I think enormous opportunity for the
state

04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:48:22.010 --> 04:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
open I want us to be open for business
 
04:48:23.390 --> 04:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
um I want that investment to come here
 
04:48:25.250 --> 04:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
both Federal money and private dollars
 
04:48:27.170 --> 04:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
to come in and I think as I said I think
 
04:48:29.330 --> 04:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
we have huge potential here
 
04:48:31.368 --> 04:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
um but it's happening now and I hope we
 
04:48:32.750 --> 04:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
can get ready through this Bill thank
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
04:48:37.448 --> 04:48:37.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator questions for Senator
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
Waters representative Corman has a
 
04:48:40.080 --> 04:48:40.850 align:start position:0%
Waters representative Corman has a
question

04:48:40.850 --> 04:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:48:42.590 --> 04:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:48:44.690 --> 04:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
Senator waters for taking my question so
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
going back to
 
04:48:49.730 --> 04:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
um yeah page three item G lines 14
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
through 17. I understand what you're
 
04:48:54.650 --> 04:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
saying about blending hydrogen into
 
04:48:56.448 --> 04:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
existing natural gas and that it's
 
04:48:59.208 --> 04:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
actually done now
 
04:49:01.850 --> 04:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
um but when we talk about hydrogen
 
04:49:05.090 --> 04:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
production from fossil fuel feedstock is
 
04:49:07.610 --> 04:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
that still green hydrogen
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
not under the definition of this bill
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why I didn't include it in a
 
04:49:15.050 --> 04:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
definition thanks for your question but
 
04:49:15.060 --> 04:49:15.708 align:start position:0%
definition thanks for your question but
um

04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know I just say in the process here
 
04:49:21.170 --> 04:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
of putting this bill together there are
 
04:49:22.730 --> 04:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of conversation a lot of
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
debate over what we're going to call
 
04:49:25.250 --> 04:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
Green hydrogen how we're going to Define
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
it can we make sure seabrook's in there
 
04:49:28.610 --> 04:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this that and there
 
04:49:30.410 --> 04:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
and then obviously people are anxious
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
about you know this kind of
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
kind of sliding into
 
04:49:38.810 --> 04:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
using natural gas or ammonia to do it
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
um but I think we've got to talk about
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
it and I think this is the place to do
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
it and you know Technologies are
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
changing I also what's important here to
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
me is that you know hydrogen is a tiny
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
tiny molecule right and um
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
and the piping you know you can't use
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
iron because it grows iron and so the
 
04:49:59.208 --> 04:49:59.218 align:start position:0%
utilities are now going over to other
 
04:50:01.368 --> 04:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
piping that can that can handle this
 
04:50:03.530 --> 04:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
because it is corrosive but then you
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
know how are you going to handle the
 
04:50:06.650 --> 04:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
Escape potential skateboard so if we're
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
going to be blending
 
04:50:09.890 --> 04:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
I want us to be very look at it very
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
carefully so that we make sure those
 
04:50:14.750 --> 04:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
those pipelines and and using it for
 
04:50:16.128 --> 04:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
that purpose there are going to be
 
04:50:18.530 --> 04:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
factories or whatever that might want to
 
04:50:21.530 --> 04:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
use both fuels so that's why I put it in
 
04:50:23.208 --> 04:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
here and I don't because it's an anxiety
 
04:50:25.490 --> 04:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
but we ought to talk about these things
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
04:50:30.050 --> 04:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
follow up right so you know I understand
 
04:50:30.060 --> 04:50:31.250 align:start position:0%
follow up right so you know I understand
about

04:50:31.250 --> 04:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:50:32.750 --> 04:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
um you know this issue about blending
 
04:50:34.310 --> 04:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
and looking into that but I guess I'm
 
04:50:37.550 --> 04:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
focusing more on uh using fossil fuel
 
04:50:39.350 --> 04:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
feed stock
 
04:50:39.360 --> 04:50:40.610 align:start position:0%
feed stock
um

04:50:40.610 --> 04:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:42.890 --> 04:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
would would you be open to eliminating
 
04:50:45.288 --> 04:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
that portion of the sentence so
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
basically uh line 16 putting a period
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
after the word uses and and removing and
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
consider policy recommendations for
 
04:50:54.590 --> 04:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
inclusion of hydrogen production from
 
04:50:56.510 --> 04:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel feed stocks so that it
 
04:50:58.270 --> 04:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
really is
 
04:51:01.010 --> 04:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
zero carbon to actually produce the
 
04:51:01.020 --> 04:51:02.810 align:start position:0%
zero carbon to actually produce the
hydrogen

04:51:02.810 --> 04:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
hydrogen
 
04:51:04.190 --> 04:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your questions I'll
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
reiterate by definition the definition
 
04:51:08.330 --> 04:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
of green hydrogen in this bill does just
 
04:51:09.650 --> 04:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
what you want
 
04:51:12.708 --> 04:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
this advisor group does not make policy
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass legislation
 
04:51:18.170 --> 04:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
it talks and makes recommendations and I
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
didn't want to close off the possibility
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
of their Heaven discussion over it I
 
04:51:23.448 --> 04:51:23.458 align:start position:0%
mean the committee will do what the
 
04:51:25.490 --> 04:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
committee wants to do but my argument is
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
that that's the benefit of advisory
 
04:51:30.050 --> 04:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
groups is that we can learn about the
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies we can hear the the
 
04:51:34.250 --> 04:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
conversations and then it's always going
 
04:51:36.410 --> 04:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
to be the legislature that decides
 
04:51:38.690 --> 04:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
whether or not to allow
 
04:51:46.128 --> 04:51:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:48.650 --> 04:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Doug Thomas has a
 
04:51:48.660 --> 04:51:49.730 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Doug Thomas has a
question

04:51:49.730 --> 04:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:51:50.990 --> 04:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:51:52.730 --> 04:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh along the same
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
line there actually uh
 
04:51:56.570 --> 04:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative Corman took part of my
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
question so I'll redirect uh in the same
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
area I'm a little confused um we were
 
04:52:03.890 --> 04:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
passed out a
 
04:52:06.530 --> 04:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
amendment that hasn't been discussed yet
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
all right I was gonna ask all right
 
04:52:12.530 --> 04:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
hold off on that okay well then
 
04:52:15.170 --> 04:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
it makes my question about paragraph G
 
04:52:17.208 --> 04:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
there mute
 
04:52:20.270 --> 04:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
moving on representative munz has a
 
04:52:20.280 --> 04:52:21.050 align:start position:0%
moving on representative munz has a
question

04:52:21.050 --> 04:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:52:23.690 --> 04:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Senator
 
04:52:23.700 --> 04:52:24.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Senator
um

04:52:24.410 --> 04:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
on on page three
 
04:52:30.530 --> 04:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
um lines eight through ten
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
um that that discussion about hydrogen
 
04:52:33.360 --> 04:52:34.490 align:start position:0%
um that that discussion about hydrogen
hub

04:52:34.490 --> 04:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
hub
 
04:52:37.490 --> 04:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
when I when I see that and I you know
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
heard your your testimony that you know
 
04:52:41.208 --> 04:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
that might apply
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
um to being a place where hydrogen from
 
04:52:47.330 --> 04:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
offshore could be stored
 
04:52:50.570 --> 04:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm recalling the the fight to
 
04:52:53.150 --> 04:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
prevent an oil refinery from being built
 
04:52:55.070 --> 04:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast
 
04:52:55.080 --> 04:52:55.610 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast
um

04:52:55.610 --> 04:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:57.890 --> 04:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
am I overreacting is this something that
 
04:53:02.510 --> 04:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question and I use
 
04:53:06.650 --> 04:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
the term hydrogen Hub because that was
 
04:53:09.288 --> 04:53:09.298 align:start position:0%
that is the term in the federal law the
 
04:53:10.850 --> 04:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
transportation act when that passed and
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
they put the initial 7.1 billion dollars
 
04:53:15.410 --> 04:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
went in there create what they called
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hubs now that encompasses a lot
 
04:53:20.208 --> 04:53:20.218 align:start position:0%
of things but it's a term that was used
 
04:53:22.010 --> 04:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
um Consortium was established out of
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
nyserda and I think it's like New Jersey
 
04:53:28.250 --> 04:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
North through all of New England except
 
04:53:29.690 --> 04:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
for us but we're considering joining
 
04:53:31.128 --> 04:53:31.138 align:start position:0%
that because they thought that if we
 
04:53:32.810 --> 04:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
came together we could propose projects
 
04:53:35.030 --> 04:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
would have a greater
 
04:53:36.830 --> 04:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
um likelihood of getting the federal
 
04:53:36.840 --> 04:53:38.270 align:start position:0%
um likelihood of getting the federal
funding

04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:53:40.250 --> 04:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
so that that's why that language is in
 
04:53:41.930 --> 04:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
there what does a hub mean what's going
 
04:53:43.310 --> 04:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
to be project
 
04:53:47.330 --> 04:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
um specific I think uh and so that's why
 
04:53:50.270 --> 04:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
it ought to be looked at here and if we
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
join the Consortium fine if we don't uh
 
04:53:55.730 --> 04:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
this group will look at the
 
04:53:59.330 --> 04:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
opportunities that might be available
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
because I think hydrogen is going to be
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
a major part of Transportation
 
04:54:06.890 --> 04:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be a major part of
 
04:54:09.050 --> 04:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
as a Storage Fuel and now how that gets
 
04:54:11.330 --> 04:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
stored is going to be a good question I
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
know there's you know I think there's a
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
desire to avoid just producing it out
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
offshore and putting it in a pipeline to
 
04:54:19.850 --> 04:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
on short
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
because that really there's all kinds of
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
issues about that of course
 
04:54:25.730 --> 04:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
in Europe what we're beginning to see is
 
04:54:27.948 --> 04:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
that they're producing it out at the
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
site and loading it onto tankers and
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
then it can go anywhere
 
04:54:33.890 --> 04:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
and it can be taken somewhere and fed
 
04:54:36.170 --> 04:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
into a power plant to produce power or
 
04:54:38.510 --> 04:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
what what have you but that's something
 
04:54:40.128 --> 04:54:40.138 align:start position:0%
that is the industry is developing right
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
now of what works best but what's going
 
04:54:43.850 --> 04:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
to work best for New Hampshire I would
 
04:54:45.170 --> 04:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
think you know we already have fuel
 
04:54:47.690 --> 04:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
storage tanks down at the Seacoast right
 
04:54:49.970 --> 04:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
and so if we have some hydrogen storage
 
04:54:51.890 --> 04:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
tanks there that might be
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
going over to do the truck the truck
 
04:54:56.510 --> 04:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
fueling or Marine hydrogen you know so
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
boats can come in and fuel up or that
 
04:55:01.850 --> 04:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
we're you know running a 50 megawatt or
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
100 megawatt
 
04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
which is what's existing now remember
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
the old wood pellet plant those become
 
04:55:08.208 --> 04:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
hydrogen yeah you're going to have to
 
04:55:09.708 --> 04:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
store some of the fuel but we're you
 
04:55:10.910 --> 04:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
know we're already storing fuel in the
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
air so I don't remember answering your
 
04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
question but this is why we need to have
 
04:55:16.430 --> 04:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
a group that kind of looks at that
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up follow-up
 
04:55:21.530 --> 04:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's probably all about what the
 
04:55:23.090 --> 04:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
size of the project is in the scale of
 
04:55:25.490 --> 04:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
it I mean do you have any sense at all
 
04:55:28.430 --> 04:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
as to how big these quote hydrogen hubs
 
04:55:28.440 --> 04:55:30.530 align:start position:0%
as to how big these quote hydrogen hubs
are

04:55:30.530 --> 04:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:55:32.448 --> 04:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
well the purple if it's actually a
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
question if you go online and look at
 
04:55:35.930 --> 04:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
you can find
 
04:55:35.940 --> 04:55:36.650 align:start position:0%
you can find
um

04:55:36.650 --> 04:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
the list of the proposals that made the
 
04:55:41.448 --> 04:55:41.458 align:start position:0%
first cut
 
04:55:43.970 --> 04:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
and the 7.1 billion
 
04:55:46.550 --> 04:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and they're all sizes all kinds of
 
04:55:49.610 --> 04:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
things from small to much bigger
 
04:55:51.470 --> 04:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
as I said though there are tens of
 
04:55:53.090 --> 04:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars
 
04:55:54.830 --> 04:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
in the ira
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
for hydrogen and treasury is not just
 
04:56:00.770 --> 04:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
making rules now
 
04:56:04.910 --> 04:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
um on on how the how that money can be
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
put out or for what kinds of projects
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we should hear pretty soon about
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
that and this is I mean what I'm trying
 
04:56:13.128 --> 04:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
to say this is why I need the bill now
 
04:56:15.770 --> 04:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
because this is coming at us is going to
 
04:56:17.628 --> 04:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
be coming out as fast and as huge
 
04:56:20.270 --> 04:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
amounts of money involved and I I think
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
this bill gives us a framework to be
 
04:56:24.830 --> 04:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
able to respond to what's coming
 
04:56:27.410 --> 04:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Doug Thomas has
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
for taking this question
 
04:56:34.610 --> 04:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
um I realized you were talking about we
 
04:56:35.868 --> 04:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
need something this fast and everything
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm curious
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
um one of your items to consider in the
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:56:47.930 --> 04:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
commission I guess or what do we call it
 
04:56:50.510 --> 04:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
advisory committee yes exactly yeah one
 
04:56:51.770 --> 04:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
of many
 
04:56:54.050 --> 04:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
um it says consider the construction of
 
04:56:56.208 --> 04:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
a dedicated hydrogen pipeline we can't
 
04:56:58.250 --> 04:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
even get a natural gas pipeline done in
 
04:57:00.350 --> 04:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
the state here and hydrogen is much more
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
flammable than than you know propane or
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
if if you want a pipeline in the state
 
04:57:08.810 --> 04:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
where you ought to build a natural gas
 
04:57:10.070 --> 04:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
one as well but I don't think it's
 
04:57:12.650 --> 04:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen either so why why
 
04:57:15.890 --> 04:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
even consider it nobody wants it
 
04:57:17.930 --> 04:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question and I look
 
04:57:20.090 --> 04:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
pretty closely at what some other states
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we've got a new industry coming and
 
04:57:25.970 --> 04:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
is recognition that you know there's
 
04:57:27.050 --> 04:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
going to be need to be some
 
04:57:27.060 --> 04:57:28.490 align:start position:0%
going to be need to be some
transportation

04:57:28.490 --> 04:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
of this I don't think we're going to see
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
a big hydrogen network but we might see
 
04:57:35.208 --> 04:57:35.218 align:start position:0%
a pipeline from the port over to peas
 
04:57:38.208 --> 04:57:38.218 align:start position:0%
or you know locally around there and the
 
04:57:39.530 --> 04:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
questions that you're raising are
 
04:57:41.990 --> 04:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
important ones do note that the bill
 
04:57:45.050 --> 04:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
clarifies too that this these this
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
hydrogen infrastructure is going to be
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
going through the SEC
 
04:57:53.810 --> 04:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
and so we will have a place that you
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
know a responsibility there for figuring
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
out what should and can't be done with
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
this new technology and the associated
 
04:58:00.718 --> 04:58:02.390 align:start position:0%
this new technology and the associated
infrastructure

04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:58:05.330 --> 04:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
I will say that I think I share all our
 
04:58:07.788 --> 04:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
frustrations whether one likes one kind
 
04:58:10.368 --> 04:58:10.378 align:start position:0%
of power source or not I don't want New
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be the black hole where
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
industry says don't go there because you
 
04:58:17.150 --> 04:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
can't get anything built it it if we're
 
04:58:18.830 --> 04:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
going to lower energy costs we need to
 
04:58:18.840 --> 04:58:20.030 align:start position:0%
going to lower energy costs we need to
consider

04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
consider
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
the these kinds of things and I and I
 
04:58:28.190 --> 04:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.288 --> 04:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
uh representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
um is thank you for this for being here
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is interesting a lot of
 
04:58:39.288 --> 04:58:39.298 align:start position:0%
hydrogen energy is being generated from
 
04:58:42.890 --> 04:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
waste from garbage does this bill in any
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
way address that methodology either
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
through the bill itself or through the
 
04:58:49.070 --> 04:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
advisory committee uh thanks for the
 
04:58:52.250 --> 04:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
question no this is hydrogen not methane
 
04:58:55.970 --> 04:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
no hydrogen is being yeah okay
 
04:58:55.980 --> 04:58:56.810 align:start position:0%
no hydrogen is being yeah okay
okay

04:58:56.810 --> 04:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:59.390 --> 04:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lewicki has a
 
04:58:59.400 --> 04:59:17.330 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lewicki has a
question

04:59:17.330 --> 04:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:17.340 --> 04:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question and um you
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
know there's there's a lot of great
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
research and reports from the EPA and
 
04:59:31.128 --> 04:59:31.138 align:start position:0%
Department of the federal department of
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
energy on their Pro their projections on
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of hydrogen production
 
04:59:38.208 --> 04:59:38.218 align:start position:0%
and um it's very it's very interesting
 
04:59:39.470 --> 04:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
what they're saying there's a couple
 
04:59:41.090 --> 04:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
things related to your question one is
 
04:59:44.208 --> 04:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
that the technology is going to improve
 
04:59:46.670 --> 04:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
so the amount of electricity needed
 
04:59:49.368 --> 04:59:49.378 align:start position:0%
to do the electrolyzing is going to be
 
04:59:51.948 --> 04:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
reduced so it becomes more more cost
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
effective so it's kind of like with the
 
04:59:55.910 --> 04:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
solar panel thing solar panels were
 
04:59:57.410 --> 04:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
super expensive now they're pretty cheap
 
04:59:58.970 --> 04:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
and they think that that trajectory over
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
the next few years for the methodology
 
05:00:03.230 --> 05:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
of electrolyzing is going to be is not
 
05:00:05.270 --> 05:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to use so much power the second
 
05:00:07.368 --> 05:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
part of it though is that you know
 
05:00:08.810 --> 05:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
because of the green hydrogen definition
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
here what is anticipated
 
05:00:13.310 --> 05:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
is that you're going to have cheap
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
source of electricity
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
that will make this possible number one
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
I think will be offshore wind
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
because that that has the potential to
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
produce a whole lot of hydrogen and it
 
05:00:26.930 --> 05:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
can electrolyzes out of salt water right
 
05:00:29.390 --> 05:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
at the turbines and then the other is
 
05:00:31.788 --> 05:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
solar I mean let's say
 
05:00:35.090 --> 05:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
that you had a coal plant somewhere and
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
you were going to take it down and
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
replace it with two or three turbines
 
05:00:41.930 --> 05:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
run by hydrogen and you're going to
 
05:00:41.940 --> 05:00:42.890 align:start position:0%
run by hydrogen and you're going to
generate

05:00:42.890 --> 05:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
generate
 
05:00:44.868 --> 05:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
the energy to do that with a couple
 
05:00:47.330 --> 05:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
hundred acres of solar on site
 
05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's the kind that's those are the
 
05:00:51.530 --> 05:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
kind of numbers that will can work for
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
this and I think that's what New
 
05:00:55.250 --> 05:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could see
 
05:00:55.260 --> 05:00:57.170 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could see
um

05:00:57.170 --> 05:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:58.850 --> 05:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
so I have a couple questions Senator
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
with regard to the tax credit
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
now the production tax credits and
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
investment tax credits created at the
 
05:01:09.770 --> 05:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
federal level for wind and solar were
 
05:01:12.830 --> 05:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
envisioned to be temporary
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
they kept getting renewed and renewed
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
and renewed and finally in the inflation
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
reduction act they were made permanent
 
05:01:23.330 --> 05:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in your testimony that
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
there are tax credits for green hydrogen
 
05:01:28.730 --> 05:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
that go up to 36 percent I think you
 
05:01:31.970 --> 05:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
said apparently so
 
05:01:35.628 --> 05:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
my question would be why do we need a
 
05:01:38.570 --> 05:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire business profits tax
 
05:01:41.690 --> 05:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
credit if there are all these federal
 
05:01:44.208 --> 05:01:44.218 align:start position:0%
tax credits available for green hydrogen
 
05:01:47.208 --> 05:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
since we know from past experience the
 
05:01:50.030 --> 05:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
tax credits never go away because once
 
05:01:53.090 --> 05:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
an industry becomes dependent upon them
 
05:01:55.070 --> 05:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
they're never going to let them go
 
05:01:57.890 --> 05:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
so my question would be why would we
 
05:01:59.530 --> 05:01:59.540 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:02:02.090 --> 05:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
subject our local New Hampshire business
 
05:02:07.730 --> 05:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
profits tax to that kind of a situation
 
05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
um thanks thanks for your uh question
 
05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that's really kind of in two parts
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
let me answer the second part first
 
05:02:14.810 --> 05:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know 2029
 
05:02:19.610 --> 05:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is over have to be renewed by the
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
legislature legislature will decide I've
 
05:02:25.910 --> 05:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
had a you know my CTE tax credit program
 
05:02:27.650 --> 05:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
I put through that's been renewed and
 
05:02:29.208 --> 05:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
there's another
 
05:02:31.850 --> 05:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
there's another r d one that has been
 
05:02:33.770 --> 05:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
renewed a couple of times but that's
 
05:02:36.170 --> 05:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
what ways and means should decide
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
um at each time and I personally only
 
05:02:42.288 --> 05:02:42.298 align:start position:0%
like tax credits of this sort
 
05:02:44.448 --> 05:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
at the startup phase
 
05:02:48.288 --> 05:02:48.298 align:start position:0%
now why do we need one in the state
 
05:02:50.090 --> 05:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to know the vagaries of the
 
05:02:52.610 --> 05:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
relationship between the federal tax
 
05:02:56.810 --> 05:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
credits and what how an industry
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
our project might it might apply or
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
might not account for certain certain
 
05:03:03.050 --> 05:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
parts of it you know in what
 
05:03:04.850 --> 05:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
relationship that might have to tax
 
05:03:06.670 --> 05:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
credits it can be
 
05:03:10.010 --> 05:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
achieved locally
 
05:03:13.128 --> 05:03:13.138 align:start position:0%
this industry can go anywhere
 
05:03:15.410 --> 05:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I think it signals that the state is
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
willing to have a little skin in the
 
05:03:19.010 --> 05:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
game here
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
um because we see the benefits
 
05:03:24.350 --> 05:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
the the potential investment the jobs
 
05:03:27.170 --> 05:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
the increase of the tax base
 
05:03:29.810 --> 05:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
here I I think are worth our making that
 
05:03:32.448 --> 05:03:32.458 align:start position:0%
relatively small investment here as as
 
05:03:34.610 --> 05:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
an incentive I should mention as well
 
05:03:37.010 --> 05:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
because I didn't before Mr chairman that
 
05:03:39.530 --> 05:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
um these projects will also be eligible
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
for 72 colon 74 if the local
 
05:03:46.368 --> 05:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
municipality wants to do the tax
 
05:03:46.378 --> 05:03:47.930 align:start position:0%
municipality wants to do the tax
deferral

05:03:47.930 --> 05:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
deferral
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
um as they do for other businesses it
 
05:03:51.170 --> 05:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't mandate it but it makes that
 
05:03:52.730 --> 05:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
possible just so see I just thought
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
these were two two little we have these
 
05:03:55.550 --> 05:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
little methods we use them for other
 
05:03:57.650 --> 05:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
other things and it's a it's an
 
05:04:00.288 --> 05:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us you know to again to
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
Signal our partnership with people in
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
state who want to make these Investments
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.330 --> 05:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
okay so you're not concerned at all then
 
05:04:13.010 --> 05:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
about the potential for these becoming
 
05:04:13.020 --> 05:04:16.550 align:start position:0%
about the potential for these becoming
permanent

05:04:16.550 --> 05:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.350 --> 05:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
well I'm a legislator you're a
 
05:04:20.208 --> 05:04:20.218 align:start position:0%
legislator not to be facetious Mr
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
chairman but we get to decide this one
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
says they go bye-bye in 2029 which seems
 
05:04:28.250 --> 05:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable five-year period
 
05:04:30.410 --> 05:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
see if they get adopted and if they're
 
05:04:32.570 --> 05:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
useful or not
 
05:04:32.580 --> 05:04:33.770 align:start position:0%
useful or not
okay

05:04:33.770 --> 05:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:04:37.730 --> 05:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:40.128 --> 05:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
saying none let's move on
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
we still have other folks we want to
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
hear from and we're actually going to
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
hear next from a couple of members of
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
our committee because
 
05:04:51.170 --> 05:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
they have amendments that they want to
 
05:04:51.180 --> 05:04:54.110 align:start position:0%
they have amendments that they want to
introduce

05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you they have amendments
 
05:04:58.490 --> 05:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
since they want to introduce to this
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill so let's have representative McGee
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
tell us about her Amendment and then
 
05:05:05.090 --> 05:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
we'll have representative Kaplan tell us
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.128 --> 05:05:16.138 align:start position:0%
actually representative if you just want
 
05:05:19.610 --> 05:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
to do it from here that's fine with me
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment I handed out to the
 
05:05:32.590 --> 05:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
committee is amendment number
 
05:05:32.600 --> 05:05:34.150 align:start position:0%
committee is amendment number
2023

05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
2023
 
05:05:39.368 --> 05:05:39.378 align:start position:0%
1345 H and it's an amendment to Simply
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
amend RSA 362 as inserted by Section 3
 
05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill by deleting sub paragraph G
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
and renumbering the original sub
 
05:05:50.448 --> 05:05:50.458 align:start position:0%
paragraphs H through k
 
05:05:50.458 --> 05:05:52.190 align:start position:0%
paragraphs H through k
uh

05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:55.250 --> 05:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
and so what what they did
 
05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
um it's not exactly what I asked them to
 
05:05:59.810 --> 05:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
do actually but uh sub paragraph G is on
 
05:06:03.410 --> 05:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
page three at line 14 and that's the
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um sentence that starts with consider
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
facilities that result in the blending
 
05:06:10.190 --> 05:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
of hydrogen into existing natural gas
 
05:06:12.530 --> 05:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
transmission and Distribution Systems
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
that serve residential commercial
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
transportation and Industrial uses
 
05:06:19.730 --> 05:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
and it was actually I asked them to put
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
a period there and remove the
 
05:06:24.530 --> 05:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
parenthetical phrase which was added as
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
part of an amendment to the original
 
05:06:28.550 --> 05:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that says and consider
 
05:06:30.770 --> 05:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
policy recommendations for inclusion of
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
hydrogen production from fossil fuel
 
05:06:35.570 --> 05:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
feedstock the reason that I wanted that
 
05:06:37.330 --> 05:06:37.340 align:start position:0%
portion of the sentence
 
05:06:40.610 --> 05:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
removed is because it is inconsistent
 
05:06:43.850 --> 05:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
with the definition as Senator Waters
 
05:06:47.690 --> 05:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
reference which is on page one line 24.
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh which says that the term does not the
 
05:06:53.390 --> 05:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
term does not include hydrogen produced
 
05:06:57.170 --> 05:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
using stream steam forming uh or any
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
other conversion technology that
 
05:07:01.850 --> 05:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
produces hydrogen from fossil fuel
 
05:07:05.690 --> 05:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
feedstock so while I do understand the
 
05:07:07.390 --> 05:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
explanation that the senator gave us
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
saying that we should investigate
 
05:07:11.690 --> 05:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
whether there would be instances where
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
it would make sense I think if we are
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
passing a bill relative to Green
 
05:07:17.890 --> 05:07:17.900 align:start position:0%
hydrogen energy
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we should do our best to keep it
 
05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
green and
 
05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
05:07:27.288 --> 05:07:27.298 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the process of
 
05:07:30.050 --> 05:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
creating hydrogen you know it's always
 
05:07:31.610 --> 05:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
going to require an energy source in
 
05:07:33.410 --> 05:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
order to split the oxygen and the
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
hydrogen but um
 
05:07:38.990 --> 05:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
the reason that we are pursuing hydrogen
 
05:07:42.890 --> 05:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
is because it's non-emitting and so
 
05:07:45.890 --> 05:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
once we open up the option of including
 
05:07:48.890 --> 05:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
gas as a source of creating the hydrogen
 
05:07:51.410 --> 05:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
then we've kind of negated the purpose
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
of pursuing hydrogen and that's
 
05:07:55.128 --> 05:07:55.138 align:start position:0%
certainly just my opinion on the subject
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
but so my bill is my Amendment to the
 
05:08:00.890 --> 05:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
bill is just designed to take that out
 
05:08:03.050 --> 05:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
for consideration of this particular
 
05:08:03.060 --> 05:08:07.310 align:start position:0%
for consideration of this particular
bill

05:08:07.310 --> 05:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.368 --> 05:08:10.378 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kaplan you want
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
to discuss your Amendment thank you Mr
 
05:08:12.718 --> 05:08:14.810 align:start position:0%
to discuss your Amendment thank you Mr
chair

05:08:14.810 --> 05:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:08:14.820 --> 05:08:15.948 align:start position:0%
chair
so

05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:15.958 --> 05:08:16.970 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:08:16.970 --> 05:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
my Amendment well first of all I want to
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank the senator for bringing a
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
what is a great Bill to to our committee
 
05:08:25.550 --> 05:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
and a forward-looking bill and I agree
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's gonna
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
allow for the establishment of very
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
important green hydrogen uh
 
05:08:32.750 --> 05:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and maybe even
 
05:08:34.368 --> 05:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and certainly
 
05:08:36.948 --> 05:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
transportation in our state so it's a
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill it's an important
 
05:08:41.868 --> 05:08:41.878 align:start position:0%
fuel source as we move to a zero carbon
 
05:08:45.288 --> 05:08:45.298 align:start position:0%
economy so thank you Senator I I just
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to offer this amendment to take
 
05:08:50.208 --> 05:08:50.218 align:start position:0%
care of some uh perhaps unintentional
 
05:08:51.770 --> 05:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
consequences that come if we're not
 
05:08:55.070 --> 05:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
careful with our definition of of what
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
is green hydrogen so I agree with
 
05:09:00.650 --> 05:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
representative McKee that um
 
05:09:02.810 --> 05:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
hydrogen produced from fossil fuel could
 
05:09:04.610 --> 05:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
not be considered green even by the
 
05:09:06.288 --> 05:09:06.298 align:start position:0%
definition of this of the statute that's
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
before us and actually hydrogen from
 
05:09:11.090 --> 05:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
natural gas is extremely carbon
 
05:09:14.208 --> 05:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
intensive it for every pound of hydrogen
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
produced you get 9 to 12 pounds of
 
05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide emissions so it's uh it's
 
05:09:22.010 --> 05:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
not what what we need if we're concerned
 
05:09:23.690 --> 05:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
with transitioning to a zero carbon
 
05:09:25.010 --> 05:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
economy it certainly doesn't have a
 
05:09:27.770 --> 05:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
place in a bill that's designed to
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
incentivize green hydrogen so my
 
05:09:30.718 --> 05:09:32.090 align:start position:0%
incentivize green hydrogen so my
Amendment

05:09:32.090 --> 05:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh just strikes that language
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.850 --> 05:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
on page three uh section uh
 
05:09:47.330 --> 05:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
the uh sorry page four under the duties
 
05:09:49.128 --> 05:09:49.138 align:start position:0%
of the advisory committee
 
05:09:52.090 --> 05:09:52.100 align:start position:0%
line uh
 
05:09:54.650 --> 05:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
16-17 It just strikes everything after
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
the comma about considering policy
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations for including hydrogen
 
05:10:00.770 --> 05:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
produced from fossil fuels feedstock
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
mine's just just simply strikes that
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
that Clause out
 
05:10:07.368 --> 05:10:07.378 align:start position:0%
uh in addition uh just to be safe you
 
05:10:08.270 --> 05:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
know just
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh there's there's us there's also other
 
05:10:13.090 --> 05:10:13.100 align:start position:0%
language on line six
 
05:10:17.448 --> 05:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
lines 14 18 and 20 that reference
 
05:10:19.550 --> 05:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
hydrogen as opposed to Green hydrogen so
 
05:10:21.890 --> 05:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
my my Amendment just basically replaces
 
05:10:24.530 --> 05:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
hydrogen with the word Green in front of
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
the hydrogen so we know we're talking
 
05:10:27.770 --> 05:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
about Green hydrogen all throughout the
 
05:10:30.650 --> 05:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:33.230 --> 05:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
um and then so the other thing that my
 
05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
Amendment does is on the first page
 
05:10:39.708 --> 05:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
under Section 7 definition of green
 
05:10:42.530 --> 05:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
hydrogen I add a line
 
05:10:42.540 --> 05:10:46.070 align:start position:0%
hydrogen I add a line
after

05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.080 --> 05:10:48.708 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:10:48.708 --> 05:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:52.030 --> 05:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
line 24 of the year of the original bill
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
after a zero carbon emission energy
 
05:10:59.150 --> 05:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
source I add the clause
 
05:11:02.690 --> 05:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh that is additional to the regional
 
05:11:04.850 --> 05:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
electric grid infrastructure as of July
 
05:11:07.070 --> 05:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 or independent of the regional
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
electric grid and the reason I add that
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
is because
 
05:11:13.250 --> 05:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
say you have a seabro and the senator
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned this himself say you have a
 
05:11:17.090 --> 05:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Nuclear Station that is
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
interested in the subsidies and the tax
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
credits available for green hydrogen and
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
decides instead of selling their energy
 
05:11:24.770 --> 05:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
into the you know forward Market or the
 
05:11:26.750 --> 05:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
iso they're going to sign a PPA with a
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen hub
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
that would actually increase our carbon
 
05:11:33.288 --> 05:11:33.298 align:start position:0%
emissions because what would replace the
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
nuclear on our default Service uh you
 
05:11:37.788 --> 05:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
know it would probably be natural gas
 
05:11:39.350 --> 05:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
maybe even coal so that would have the
 
05:11:41.390 --> 05:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of actually
 
05:11:43.250 --> 05:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
raising our carbon emissions which is
 
05:11:45.410 --> 05:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
not the purpose of pursuing green
 
05:11:47.448 --> 05:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
hydrogen so I I just thought that any
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
kind of energy source that would be
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
under the definition of green hydrogen
 
05:11:52.850 --> 05:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
would have to be something that's
 
05:11:55.490 --> 05:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
additional to the grid and that's that's
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
actually what the European commission
 
05:11:58.490 --> 05:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
includes in their definition of green
 
05:12:01.250 --> 05:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
hydrogen uh so that's why I have that
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
language there
 
05:12:02.520 --> 05:12:03.650 align:start position:0%
language there
um

05:12:03.650 --> 05:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:05.690 --> 05:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
so I mean I think that it's a great bill
 
05:12:07.970 --> 05:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
it could be improved and uh you know I'm
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
looking forward to working with the
 
05:12:11.090 --> 05:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
05:12:13.970 --> 05:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
on strengthening this bill whether we
 
05:12:16.190 --> 05:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
choose a you know line Amendment
 
05:12:18.650 --> 05:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative mcgeesman or we or some
 
05:12:19.970 --> 05:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
other router we decided to throw it out
 
05:12:22.850 --> 05:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
altogether but I welcome the senator for
 
05:12:24.530 --> 05:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward
 
05:12:26.510 --> 05:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
so Senator Waters could you come back up
 
05:12:29.330 --> 05:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
to the table and do a couple of things
 
05:12:30.530 --> 05:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:12:32.750 --> 05:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
number one give us your reaction to
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
well my reaction is I respect the wisdom
 
05:12:40.970 --> 05:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
um as a senator and uh I understand what
 
05:12:47.930 --> 05:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.940 --> 05:12:48.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:12:48.788 --> 05:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:51.170 --> 05:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
you know the a lot of discussion about
 
05:12:52.670 --> 05:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
05:12:55.970 --> 05:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
Confluence on a green hydrogen plant and
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
that the folks who wanted to have other
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
natural gas were happy to see that we at
 
05:13:02.510 --> 05:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
least could talk about it but I
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
understand what's being said about
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
striking that that that and um I I
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
understand where that's coming from and
 
05:13:11.208 --> 05:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
if that's the way it needs to go I
 
05:13:13.610 --> 05:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
respect your you know the the vote of
 
05:13:16.010 --> 05:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
this committee on I'm not sure that I
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
quite followed the parts about what why
 
05:13:21.410 --> 05:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
the part on the first page was needed I
 
05:13:21.420 --> 05:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
the part on the first page was needed I
just

05:13:22.550 --> 05:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:13:26.090 --> 05:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
I want to be sure that steam production
 
05:13:28.610 --> 05:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
of hydrogen that might be possible at
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
Seabrook is included
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
as a possibility for producing green
 
05:13:36.050 --> 05:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
hydrogen I think that's important I I
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a good that's wasted energy
 
05:13:42.650 --> 05:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
otherwise and um I I think it can help
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
us too in producing hydrogen there that
 
05:13:48.170 --> 05:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
then can be very useful to us so I I'm
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
sorry representative I didn't I couldn't
 
05:13:52.670 --> 05:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
quite hear and follow what was being
 
05:13:54.050 --> 05:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
done there if you think that some
 
05:13:55.490 --> 05:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
language changes needs to be made to
 
05:13:58.190 --> 05:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
clarify some things you want great but
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's just my Proviso there let's just
 
05:14:01.850 --> 05:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
make sure that because that that that
 
05:14:03.830 --> 05:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
that definition is worked on carefully
 
05:14:06.170 --> 05:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
with next next era and I just don't want
 
05:14:08.330 --> 05:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
to kind of get in a position where we're
 
05:14:10.430 --> 05:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
we're kind of excluding them from be
 
05:14:12.770 --> 05:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
able to do do something
 
05:14:15.948 --> 05:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
okay and number two just as I was
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledging these two folks over here
 
05:14:21.230 --> 05:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
you handed me some Amendment texts is
 
05:14:23.090 --> 05:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
this text that you want us to consider
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and what it is is this is
 
05:14:26.930 --> 05:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
from Mr Wong who maybe I don't know if
 
05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
he's still here to he may be are you
 
05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
going to testify yeah so it was the the
 
05:14:34.070 --> 05:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
in in looking again at it they said they
 
05:14:35.810 --> 05:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
needed to just shift chain make some
 
05:14:37.128 --> 05:14:37.138 align:start position:0%
changes the language about how the tax
 
05:14:38.990 --> 05:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
credit worked and that's what's there he
 
05:14:40.368 --> 05:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
also wants to make sure that the
 
05:14:42.170 --> 05:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
expiration date remember there is an
 
05:14:43.730 --> 05:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
expiration date
 
05:14:45.770 --> 05:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
um Accords with the tax year rather than
 
05:14:48.170 --> 05:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
the date that I put on it so and then um
 
05:14:49.730 --> 05:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
Josh Elliott pointed out that we needed
 
05:14:53.150 --> 05:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
to add or designee to the um
 
05:14:56.570 --> 05:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
the chair of the SEC
 
05:14:59.208 --> 05:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
okay great so we will have three
 
05:15:01.010 --> 05:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
amendments to consider when the time
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
comes representative Doug Thomas
 
05:15:05.390 --> 05:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you for taking my
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
question uh what you just mentioned
 
05:15:10.730 --> 05:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
about Seabrook uh you you the reason for
 
05:15:11.868 --> 05:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
leaving that in there is this
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
possibility of of some of their steam
 
05:15:17.930 --> 05:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
could be used for is that a
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
it is that a a a practical or a or a
 
05:15:23.040 --> 05:15:24.770 align:start position:0%
it is that a a a practical or a or a
political

05:15:24.770 --> 05:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
political
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
um uh uh way to make sure that you know
 
05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know Seabrook may like to make some
 
05:15:34.010 --> 05:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
money off of uh this process and if they
 
05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
were able to participate in this they
 
05:15:38.590 --> 05:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
would be more more willing to
 
05:15:41.390 --> 05:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
participate and and help with this uh
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming this is purely
 
05:15:44.990 --> 05:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
practical I I the technology is such
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
that there are there is capacity to make
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
hydrogen using the steam power and
 
05:15:51.530 --> 05:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good thing and and
 
05:15:54.288 --> 05:15:54.298 align:start position:0%
Seabrook has Steam so it has nothing to
 
05:15:55.730 --> 05:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
do with political it's just you know
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
practical possibilities that's because
 
05:15:59.390 --> 05:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
we have Seabrook that this would be
 
05:16:01.250 --> 05:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
useful this could be useful for him yeah
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
and for us uh what I what I meant by
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
political was that it it enables them to
 
05:16:06.958 --> 05:16:08.270 align:start position:0%
political was that it it enables them to
maybe

05:16:08.270 --> 05:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:16:11.628 --> 05:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
um help in in getting this green uh
 
05:16:14.208 --> 05:16:14.218 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen uh project going uh
 
05:16:16.250 --> 05:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
knowing that they will be able to uh
 
05:16:18.650 --> 05:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
participate yeah and profit from it yeah
 
05:16:20.628 --> 05:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
thanks for that that part see you know
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're all waiting for the treasury
 
05:16:24.110 --> 05:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
Department to drop the final regulations
 
05:16:26.750 --> 05:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
and Rule making on how that money is
 
05:16:28.368 --> 05:16:28.378 align:start position:0%
going to come be coming out of the IRA
 
05:16:31.250 --> 05:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
and I but I do know from I had some
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with some federal officials
 
05:16:36.350 --> 05:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago that um you know that
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
there there is there are particular
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
incentives for taking existing power
 
05:16:43.128 --> 05:16:43.138 align:start position:0%
plants and and being able to either
 
05:16:45.470 --> 05:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
transition transition them or utilize
 
05:16:47.150 --> 05:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
them towards green hydrogen production
 
05:16:50.570 --> 05:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
so I would hope that this would again I
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
I if we could do something to help set
 
05:16:54.708 --> 05:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
us up to leverage some of that money so
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
we can get investment here that's what
 
05:17:00.050 --> 05:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.050 --> 05:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you senator now let's get the
 
05:17:05.690 --> 05:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
dra perspective here I'm going to ask Mr
 
05:17:09.288 --> 05:17:09.298 align:start position:0%
King Wing Mong to come and talk to us
 
05:17:13.250 --> 05:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
um just a second I got your card here
 
05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere Lauren O'Sullivan right
 
05:17:22.490 --> 05:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
so let's get the DS dra's perspective on
 
05:17:25.368 --> 05:17:25.378 align:start position:0%
uh both the change that Senator Waters
 
05:17:27.650 --> 05:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
and apparently you folks uh would like
 
05:17:30.530 --> 05:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
to see and your general observations
 
05:17:32.448 --> 05:17:32.458 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
05:17:34.550 --> 05:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
this portion of the bill thank you good
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Keane Ming Wong
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
text policy Council of the dra
 
05:17:40.550 --> 05:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm Lauren O'Sullivan senior
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
Financial Analyst at the dra
 
05:17:44.930 --> 05:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
the department does not have a position
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
on this bill but seeing that uh there is
 
05:17:51.530 --> 05:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
a tax credit component uh to the BPT so
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
uh the department has taken a position
 
05:17:57.230 --> 05:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
to uh sort of try to ensure that the
 
05:18:00.410 --> 05:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is workable to to
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
administer the business profits tax
 
05:18:05.090 --> 05:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
credit that's available first off uh we
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
do think that the um the green hydrogen
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
facility is also would qualify as a
 
05:18:13.850 --> 05:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
utility property and potentially be
 
05:18:16.730 --> 05:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
subject to the utility property tax
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and then so on to us to the uh the
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
business profits tax credit as Senator
 
05:18:25.550 --> 05:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
Waters mentioned that he wanted to model
 
05:18:28.970 --> 05:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
this credit against the BPT uh similar
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
to the research and development credit
 
05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's currently available and the way
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
it works is that that is a cap amount of
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh credit that's available to be given
 
05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
out to all to the pool of applicants
 
05:18:46.750 --> 05:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
within any fiscal year
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
according to this uh proposed bill here
 
05:18:53.810 --> 05:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
that pool of credit available is five
 
05:18:57.708 --> 05:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
million dollars per fiscal year and
 
05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
therefore in order for us to make a
 
05:18:59.760 --> 05:19:01.150 align:start position:0%
therefore in order for us to make a
determination

05:19:01.150 --> 05:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
determination
 
05:19:04.788 --> 05:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
if there are applicants who applications
 
05:19:07.368 --> 05:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
that might come in that at the total of
 
05:19:09.170 --> 05:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year might exited 5 million
 
05:19:12.110 --> 05:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
we would then need to collect all the
 
05:19:14.930 --> 05:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
applications first and then run our
 
05:19:17.448 --> 05:19:17.458 align:start position:0%
calculation and then if there's an if
 
05:19:19.490 --> 05:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
the amount of credit is being applied
 
05:19:21.948 --> 05:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
for excess of five million we need to
 
05:19:25.550 --> 05:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
prorate that to each of the applicants
 
05:19:28.190 --> 05:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
um so the the way it's structured right
 
05:19:29.650 --> 05:19:29.660 align:start position:0%
now is
 
05:19:34.550 --> 05:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
if tax if year one is when the uh the
 
05:19:38.570 --> 05:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
the utility incurred a cost it would
 
05:19:40.730 --> 05:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
actually then apply to against the
 
05:19:43.368 --> 05:19:43.378 align:start position:0%
business profits tax on the second year
 
05:19:45.410 --> 05:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
so the credit would then apply to the
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
second year so it's not to the first is
 
05:19:48.350 --> 05:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
05:19:50.690 --> 05:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
so and we
 
05:19:53.208 --> 05:19:53.218 align:start position:0%
drive to some language in terms of the
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax credit uh what
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
I did not mention to Senator Waters
 
05:20:00.830 --> 05:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
earlier on and then what he did mention
 
05:20:03.650 --> 05:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
just now after I spoke to him was that
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
we wanted to add additional language to
 
05:20:07.850 --> 05:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
the end of the bill
 
05:20:11.150 --> 05:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to the cessation of the
 
05:20:15.050 --> 05:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
the BPT credit which would be on page
 
05:20:15.060 --> 05:20:16.868 align:start position:0%
the BPT credit which would be on page
four

05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:20:19.550 --> 05:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
line 12.
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
so section 7 effective date for Section
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
6 section six which is the repeal of the
 
05:20:27.050 --> 05:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh the credit against the BPT
 
05:20:29.448 --> 05:20:29.458 align:start position:0%
currently it says section six of his
 
05:20:32.570 --> 05:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
actual ticket effect January 1 2029
 
05:20:35.868 --> 05:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to propose that that the
 
05:20:37.730 --> 05:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
committee considered changing that
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
language to session six of this egg
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
shell be effective taxable periods
 
05:20:46.250 --> 05:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 31 2029 so
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
it coincides with a textbook period as
 
05:20:49.550 --> 05:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to just a
 
05:20:52.910 --> 05:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
so it's clearer that when um when the
 
05:20:58.550 --> 05:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:01.788 --> 05:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
so you said on or after January 1st on
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
or after so so you would read taxable uh
 
05:21:09.410 --> 05:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
section 6 of this act shall take uh
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
shall be effective
 
05:21:14.330 --> 05:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
taxable periods ending on or after
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:36.050 --> 05:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
anything else uh
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
nope that that's uh pretty much it
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay questions for these folks
 
05:21:44.570 --> 05:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:21:45.830 --> 05:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:21:45.840 --> 05:21:47.090 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

05:21:47.090 --> 05:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that the the pool of
 
05:21:52.610 --> 05:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
BPT tax credit is 5 million annually I'm
 
05:21:54.530 --> 05:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
assuming it's a lapsing fund and it gets
 
05:21:57.170 --> 05:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
replenished is it generally 5 million or
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
has it been for some time
 
05:22:01.910 --> 05:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
or is it does it fluctuate
 
05:22:01.920 --> 05:22:10.550 align:start position:0%
or is it does it fluctuate
foreign

05:22:10.550 --> 05:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:12.890 --> 05:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
the way it was proposed that the cap is
 
05:22:16.970 --> 05:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
5 million for every uh fiscal year
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
from when it started so um it's that cap
 
05:22:22.788 --> 05:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
is not going to change not to my
 
05:22:24.948 --> 05:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
knowledge okay and follow up
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
follow up and so you have no way of
 
05:22:29.330 --> 05:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
knowing whether the 5 million will be
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
tapped and you're saying if if you get
 
05:22:33.470 --> 05:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
more requests for credit than you have
 
05:22:35.208 --> 05:22:35.218 align:start position:0%
then you just prorate what's there and
 
05:22:36.288 --> 05:22:36.298 align:start position:0%
make sure it goes out to everybody
 
05:22:38.090 --> 05:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
that's applied that type of thing yes
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and the maximum credit would be five
 
05:22:43.730 --> 05:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
million yep
 
05:22:45.890 --> 05:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
is that I'm sorry did that answer your
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
question so 5 million could go to one
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
one project uh no so it also says here
 
05:22:53.638 --> 05:22:55.010 align:start position:0%
one project uh no so it also says here
um

05:22:55.010 --> 05:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:57.170 --> 05:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
the amount of credit which shall be used
 
05:22:58.550 --> 05:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
to offset the business profits tax
 
05:23:00.890 --> 05:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
liability this is in the amended
 
05:23:02.448 --> 05:23:02.458 align:start position:0%
language that Senator Waters sentence
 
05:23:02.458 --> 05:23:03.410 align:start position:0%
language that Senator Waters sentence
yes

05:23:03.410 --> 05:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:23:03.420 --> 05:23:04.010 align:start position:0%
yes
um

05:23:04.010 --> 05:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:06.890 --> 05:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
for subsequent Tax Repair shall be 10 of
 
05:23:09.948 --> 05:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
the qualifying cost and shall not exceed
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
500 000 for any taxable period okay so
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
for any any one applicant yeah yeah
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:22.128 --> 05:23:22.138 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions
 
05:23:25.128 --> 05:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
representative not her
 
05:23:27.288 --> 05:23:27.298 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh for the record how do
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
you spell your last name
 
05:23:33.170 --> 05:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
w-o-n-g oh thank you I forgot what your
 
05:23:34.970 --> 05:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
name was I knew it I wouldn't have had
 
05:23:38.090 --> 05:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:40.368 --> 05:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
okay so if I understand it correctly
 
05:23:42.410 --> 05:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
then that this bill because it provides
 
05:23:44.448 --> 05:23:44.458 align:start position:0%
for a six-year tax credit
 
05:23:46.430 --> 05:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
of five million dollars no more than
 
05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
five million dollars a year that would
 
05:23:50.090 --> 05:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
be a 30 million dollar tax credit over
 
05:23:53.208 --> 05:23:53.218 align:start position:0%
the life of this program
 
05:23:56.208 --> 05:23:56.218 align:start position:0%
I believe it would actually be more like
 
05:23:58.128 --> 05:23:58.138 align:start position:0%
a five-year
 
05:23:58.138 --> 05:23:58.868 align:start position:0%
a five-year
um

05:23:58.868 --> 05:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:03.890 --> 05:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
yeah so 25 million okay thank you
 
05:24:07.850 --> 05:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:09.948 --> 05:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none thanks to you folks for
 
05:24:11.930 --> 05:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
being here thank you appreciate your
 
05:24:14.868 --> 05:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
patience it's been a long day I know
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
now we'll hear from Griffin Roberge from
 
05:24:18.530 --> 05:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy to get the
 
05:24:20.030 --> 05:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective on this
 
05:24:20.040 --> 05:24:26.030 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective on this
legislation

05:24:26.030 --> 05:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.050 --> 05:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:32.510 --> 05:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman
 
05:24:33.590 --> 05:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
um I know there are a number of
 
05:24:36.288 --> 05:24:36.298 align:start position:0%
amendments kicking around I'm going to
 
05:24:38.150 --> 05:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
try to keep it simple
 
05:24:40.550 --> 05:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
um department is neutral to the bill as
 
05:24:42.530 --> 05:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate no comments
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
underneath the Amendments uh heck that I
 
05:24:46.128 --> 05:24:46.138 align:start position:0%
haven't seen
 
05:24:46.138 --> 05:24:46.910 align:start position:0%
haven't seen
um

05:24:46.910 --> 05:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:49.250 --> 05:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill is obviously a tax
 
05:24:52.550 --> 05:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
policy Bill we are not a tax agency dra
 
05:24:53.930 --> 05:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
was here to answer questions so we'll
 
05:24:56.930 --> 05:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
defer any feedback
 
05:24:56.940 --> 05:24:57.530 align:start position:0%
defer any feedback
um

05:24:57.530 --> 05:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
on the tax policy provisions of this
 
05:24:59.520 --> 05:25:00.288 align:start position:0%
on the tax policy provisions of this
bill

05:25:00.288 --> 05:25:00.298 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
um I think Senator Waters has spoken
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
quite a bit uh regarding the definitions
 
05:25:07.610 --> 05:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
um in the bill I think the Departments
 
05:25:09.770 --> 05:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
only observation will be pertaining to
 
05:25:12.050 --> 05:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
section 3 of the bill which begins on
 
05:25:14.570 --> 05:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
page I'm sorry uh deals with the
 
05:25:16.190 --> 05:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
advisory committee established under
 
05:25:18.050 --> 05:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill that's page
 
05:25:18.060 --> 05:25:19.128 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill that's page
two

05:25:19.128 --> 05:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:25:21.530 --> 05:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
line 26.
 
05:25:24.590 --> 05:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
um as noted in the fiscal note the
 
05:25:24.600 --> 05:25:25.810 align:start position:0%
um as noted in the fiscal note the
department

05:25:25.810 --> 05:25:25.820 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:25:29.208 --> 05:25:29.218 align:start position:0%
does feel that uh what is it um would
 
05:25:31.128 --> 05:25:31.138 align:start position:0%
not have a creating this advisory
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
committee would not have
 
05:25:35.690 --> 05:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
um any type of fiscal impact however in
 
05:25:37.190 --> 05:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
talking internally the department does
 
05:25:39.288 --> 05:25:39.298 align:start position:0%
feel that uh the legislature should
 
05:25:41.150 --> 05:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
maybe consider creating a legislative
 
05:25:43.730 --> 05:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
study committee rather than an Advisory
 
05:25:46.670 --> 05:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
Group to examine these issues earlier I
 
05:25:48.890 --> 05:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
would have suggested a study commission
 
05:25:50.810 --> 05:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
but I realized that the House and Senate
 
05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
have different rules on that regarding
 
05:25:55.250 --> 05:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
legislative makeup but we defer on that
 
05:25:57.890 --> 05:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
on that on that front to the to the
 
05:25:57.900 --> 05:25:59.390 align:start position:0%
on that on that front to the to the
legislature

05:25:59.390 --> 05:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
05:25:59.400 --> 05:26:00.110 align:start position:0%
legislature
um

05:26:00.110 --> 05:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:03.590 --> 05:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
we would we submit that obviously this
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
advisory committee has a lot of agency
 
05:26:05.280 --> 05:26:06.770 align:start position:0%
advisory committee has a lot of agency
heads

05:26:06.770 --> 05:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
heads
 
05:26:08.750 --> 05:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
um as I think has been expressed earlier
 
05:26:10.730 --> 05:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
in site evaluation committee testimony
 
05:26:14.330 --> 05:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit leery of of uh
 
05:26:16.368 --> 05:26:16.378 align:start position:0%
engaging advisory committees that are
 
05:26:19.128 --> 05:26:19.138 align:start position:0%
heavily dependent on full-time agency
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
heads taking the lead or designees that
 
05:26:24.530 --> 05:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
come on and off as time goes on so we
 
05:26:25.850 --> 05:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
figure maybe a legislative study
 
05:26:27.410 --> 05:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
committee might be something to suggest
 
05:26:30.050 --> 05:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
here if that is not of interest to the
 
05:26:30.060 --> 05:26:30.948 align:start position:0%
here if that is not of interest to the
committee

05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:26:33.650 --> 05:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
um I would respectfully suggest going a
 
05:26:35.270 --> 05:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
little further and making one slight
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to The Advisory advisory
 
05:26:39.650 --> 05:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
committee and that is striking entirely
 
05:26:43.550 --> 05:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
The Language online 32.
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
um the chair of the site evaluation
 
05:26:47.628 --> 05:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
committee for two reasons one I know
 
05:26:49.368 --> 05:26:49.378 align:start position:0%
when Senator Waters Amendment he
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
suggested uh putting or designee as is
 
05:26:54.288 --> 05:26:54.298 align:start position:0%
under statute right now the chair of the
 
05:26:57.610 --> 05:26:57.620 align:start position:0%
SEC is the chair of the puc
 
05:27:00.890 --> 05:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
we are just concerned about giving a
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
member potentially two votes on a
 
05:27:03.240 --> 05:27:04.490 align:start position:0%
member potentially two votes on a
committee

05:27:04.490 --> 05:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and even with the or designee
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
language it still invites the potential
 
05:27:10.010 --> 05:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
for that occurring
 
05:27:11.570 --> 05:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
um that's one reason the second reason
 
05:27:14.090 --> 05:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
is there's also a duty for the commit
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
for the advisory committee in uh
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
considering the construction of a
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated hydrogen pipeline or network
 
05:27:22.730 --> 05:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
of pipelines to serve users of hydrogen
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the extent that that might require
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee approval I
 
05:27:28.850 --> 05:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
don't think we want a member of the site
 
05:27:31.550 --> 05:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee giving giving
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
feedback on that
 
05:27:35.448 --> 05:27:35.458 align:start position:0%
um with that
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
um happy to take any questions that
 
05:27:39.530 --> 05:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has one okay
 
05:27:47.990 --> 05:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
05:27:48.000 --> 05:27:50.570 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
robash

05:27:50.570 --> 05:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.690 --> 05:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
how much hydrogen infrastructure exists
 
05:27:55.850 --> 05:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire today if I had a tanker
 
05:27:58.850 --> 05:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
truckload of hydrogen who would buy it
 
05:28:01.490 --> 05:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
who could use it sure and and thank
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't think
 
05:28:05.208 --> 05:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
I have an immediate answer to that but I
 
05:28:07.010 --> 05:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
would Circle back to Senator Waters
 
05:28:10.070 --> 05:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
comments is that certainly there is
 
05:28:12.530 --> 05:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
um a big potential for an expansion of
 
05:28:14.628 --> 05:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
this type of energy technology in the
 
05:28:14.638 --> 05:28:15.830 align:start position:0%
this type of energy technology in the
future

05:28:15.830 --> 05:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:28:15.840 --> 05:28:16.610 align:start position:0%
future
um

05:28:16.610 --> 05:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:19.070 --> 05:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
trying to measure out what may or may
 
05:28:20.330 --> 05:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
not occur in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:28:22.610 --> 05:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
in the future I couldn't guess
 
05:28:24.230 --> 05:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I could certainly ask around the
 
05:28:25.430 --> 05:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
department to follow up with you on your
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.208 --> 05:28:32.218 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:28:34.250 --> 05:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
05:28:36.110 --> 05:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
um you just said that the chair of the
 
05:28:38.510 --> 05:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
SEC is also the chair of the puc is that
 
05:28:40.788 --> 05:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
always or just currently nope that's all
 
05:28:42.170 --> 05:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question first
 
05:28:42.180 --> 05:28:42.948 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question first
off

05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
off
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
um that's always been okay the case in
 
05:28:49.970 --> 05:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:54.050 --> 05:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:28:57.288 --> 05:28:57.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Vaughn
 
05:28:58.910 --> 05:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
and call on our last speaker on this
 
05:29:07.190 --> 05:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:10.610 --> 05:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
welcome back to sdne
 
05:29:17.208 --> 05:29:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.218 --> 05:29:22.430 align:start position:0%
 
happened

05:29:22.430 --> 05:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.490 --> 05:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.500 --> 05:29:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
purchase

05:29:30.590 --> 05:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:29:34.910 --> 05:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
I will dispenser the bio because I think
 
05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard it before and it's on the
 
05:29:39.410 --> 05:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
on this testimony but um thank you for
 
05:29:41.690 --> 05:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
allowing me to come before you today uh
 
05:29:43.490 --> 05:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
I am in support of this bill and I'm
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
acting as a sole individual I'm not
 
05:29:48.890 --> 05:29:48.900 align:start position:0%
representing any other organization
 
05:29:51.170 --> 05:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill you'll hear some
 
05:29:53.150 --> 05:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
common commonalities of what you've
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
heard before this bill provides
 
05:29:56.750 --> 05:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
excellent basis for adding green
 
05:29:58.430 --> 05:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
hydrogen facilities and infrastructure
 
05:30:00.830 --> 05:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
to enable renewable energy generation in
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
it provides a much-needed definition of
 
05:30:06.770 --> 05:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen in its production from
 
05:30:08.868 --> 05:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
clean energy resources
 
05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
and green energy or excuse me green
 
05:30:13.730 --> 05:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
hydrogen has a potential service of as
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters said as a Storage Fuel
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
from offshore wind energy that's thus
 
05:30:20.090 --> 05:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
solving the intermittency issue of
 
05:30:22.970 --> 05:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
onshore offshore wind it also increase
 
05:30:25.010 --> 05:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
the reliability of electric generation
 
05:30:25.020 --> 05:30:26.510 align:start position:0%
the reliability of electric generation
and

05:30:26.510 --> 05:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:30:28.250 --> 05:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
um it's it's also fairly well known that
 
05:30:31.368 --> 05:30:31.378 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen can also be reformed into
 
05:30:31.378 --> 05:30:33.050 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen can also be reformed into
ammonia

05:30:33.050 --> 05:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
ammonia
 
05:30:35.270 --> 05:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh they're chemically similar ammonia
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
has hydrogen in it with nitrogen and in
 
05:30:40.368 --> 05:30:40.378 align:start position:0%
fact it's used as is transportation fuel
 
05:30:45.050 --> 05:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
in in shipping and we're seeing in other
 
05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
foreign markets where uh hydrogen is
 
05:30:49.490 --> 05:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
actually being converted ammonia then
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
ship being shipped to places like Japan
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
where then it's reformed back to
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
hydrogen it's a much simpler fuel Taxi
 
05:30:58.550 --> 05:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
transport not as hazardous as just a
 
05:30:59.868 --> 05:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
hydrogen itself
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I did uh my my um
 
05:31:05.868 --> 05:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
um support for this this bill is subject
 
05:31:08.270 --> 05:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the same amendment that was proposed
 
05:31:10.610 --> 05:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
by uh representative McGee and that's
 
05:31:13.730 --> 05:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
that section 2G for the advisory
 
05:31:16.490 --> 05:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
committee and to remove the language uh
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
quote unquote and consider policy
 
05:31:19.550 --> 05:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations for inclusion of
 
05:31:21.170 --> 05:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
hydrogen production from fossil fuel
 
05:31:23.390 --> 05:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
feedback and I think that is
 
05:31:25.788 --> 05:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the intention of of
 
05:31:28.850 --> 05:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:31.250 --> 05:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my testimony thank
 
05:31:32.750 --> 05:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
you very much appreciate it questions
 
05:31:37.970 --> 05:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:40.430 --> 05:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:31:40.440 --> 05:31:41.570 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
chair

05:31:41.570 --> 05:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:31:44.448 --> 05:31:44.458 align:start position:0%
um this uh is going to piggyback on a
 
05:31:46.850 --> 05:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
question that representative Doug Thomas
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
asked earlier
 
05:31:52.250 --> 05:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
um if we if we go to this hydrogen as a
 
05:31:53.448 --> 05:31:53.458 align:start position:0%
field Source we're going to have to have
 
05:31:56.448 --> 05:31:56.458 align:start position:0%
pipelines do you see any pushback in New
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on establishing new pipelines
 
05:32:01.250 --> 05:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I think we've all been down the road
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
it might be an extremely difficult thing
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do yeah but keep in mind that
 
05:32:07.250 --> 05:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
elsewhere around the world especially in
 
05:32:09.110 --> 05:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
the UK
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
um oh what number the pipelines in the
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
UK are being converted from natural gas
 
05:32:14.930 --> 05:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
to hydrogen transmission
 
05:32:17.208 --> 05:32:17.218 align:start position:0%
so there was some compatibility within
 
05:32:18.470 --> 05:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
those debt infrastructure that's
 
05:32:21.050 --> 05:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
currently in the ground so I wouldn't
 
05:32:23.030 --> 05:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
write off our current infrastructure as
 
05:32:24.850 --> 05:32:24.860 align:start position:0%
being also supported transmission of
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
hydrogen and and to also um address the
 
05:32:30.530 --> 05:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
issue about a hydrogen Hub
 
05:32:32.330 --> 05:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
um that's a technology and actually term
 
05:32:34.490 --> 05:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
used in the in the um the current
 
05:32:36.890 --> 05:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
natural gas transmission Market you've
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
probably heard of the term Henry Hudson
 
05:32:42.530 --> 05:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
Hub it's a hub down in New York City
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
where they basically use that as the
 
05:32:47.330 --> 05:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
pricing mechanism for for methane uh
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
natural gas so a hub of this nature for
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
for hydrogen perhaps using the same
 
05:32:56.090 --> 05:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we have in place could
 
05:32:57.170 --> 05:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
actually be a concept that could
 
05:32:59.570 --> 05:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
actually work I have a follow-up
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
05:33:05.930 --> 05:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
um what would a hydrogen leak look like
 
05:33:05.940 --> 05:33:07.190 align:start position:0%
um what would a hydrogen leak look like
hmm

05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
it's a you can't see it well okay I
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
think it's odorless
 
05:33:14.930 --> 05:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
and you probably know after it's all
 
05:33:16.550 --> 05:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
released and you might have an explosion
 
05:33:20.110 --> 05:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
so it's a highly inflammable gas
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's very reactive it wants to go back
 
05:33:25.070 --> 05:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
to being part of water
 
05:33:28.810 --> 05:33:28.820 align:start position:0%
and that process is very energy
 
05:33:31.730 --> 05:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
emitting process so how do you identify
 
05:33:32.690 --> 05:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
it there are special instrument
 
05:33:34.368 --> 05:33:34.378 align:start position:0%
instruments like they use for methane
 
05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
for natural gas but is there land
 
05:33:39.010 --> 05:33:39.020 align:start position:0%
contamination I'm sorry land
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
contamination that wouldn't be a problem
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
because it's a gas okay
 
05:33:44.510 --> 05:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
evolves into the atmosphere not in this
 
05:33:46.910 --> 05:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
world thank you sorry
 
05:33:50.208 --> 05:33:50.218 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds ask a question
 
05:33:51.708 --> 05:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman another
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
follow-up to
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas's question
 
05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
about the referenced opposition passed
 
05:34:01.690 --> 05:34:01.700 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
new pipelines do you think it's possible
 
05:34:07.010 --> 05:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
that a significant part of such
 
05:34:10.910 --> 05:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to pipelines in the past was
 
05:34:10.920 --> 05:34:12.170 align:start position:0%
opposition to pipelines in the past was
do

05:34:12.170 --> 05:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:34:15.170 --> 05:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
to the fact that
 
05:34:18.170 --> 05:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
those proposals represented
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
massive investment in fossil fuel
 
05:34:24.730 --> 05:34:24.740 align:start position:0%
infrastructure which would then be
 
05:34:27.470 --> 05:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
socialized and which would then be
 
05:34:30.350 --> 05:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
required to be paid off in other words
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
those Investments would have locked us
 
05:34:35.390 --> 05:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
into that use of that fossil fuel for 30
 
05:34:38.810 --> 05:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
to 50 years and that's why at least some
 
05:34:42.288 --> 05:34:42.298 align:start position:0%
of that opposition was so vociferous I'm
 
05:34:44.090 --> 05:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
not an expert on pipelines but I think
 
05:34:46.850 --> 05:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
there is some some truth to that many
 
05:34:48.890 --> 05:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
people have looked at natural gas as a
 
05:34:52.610 --> 05:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
transition fuel to a carbon-free uh
 
05:34:55.250 --> 05:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
energy environment sometime in the later
 
05:34:56.810 --> 05:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
part of this first half of the century
 
05:34:58.610 --> 05:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
so I think many people in opposition
 
05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
those pipelines didn't want to see those
 
05:35:02.930 --> 05:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
stranded costs being put in the ground
 
05:35:06.050 --> 05:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
and then would continue the industry for
 
05:35:08.288 --> 05:35:08.298 align:start position:0%
many years into the future
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
there may be less opposition to
 
05:35:14.330 --> 05:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
pipelines that have hydrogen because
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's a climate-friendly fuel so there
 
05:35:19.490 --> 05:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
may indeed be less opposition to that
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
but right this at this point for me it's
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman actually it's
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
just a point of clarification since
 
05:35:33.770 --> 05:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is lighter than air it is less
 
05:35:35.868 --> 05:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
likely to explode than a heavier than
 
05:35:38.708 --> 05:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
air gas like methane which will puddle
 
05:35:41.090 --> 05:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
dehydrogen will go up and it's likely to
 
05:35:43.070 --> 05:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
do no more than ignite and it's not
 
05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:48.650 --> 05:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for that point of
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
clarification a physics experiment right
 
05:35:50.638 --> 05:35:53.090 align:start position:0%
clarification a physics experiment right
yes

05:35:53.090 --> 05:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:55.070 --> 05:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions I want to
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to help us
 
05:35:59.930 --> 05:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
understand the issues involved and
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 167. thank you and seeing I
 
05:36:05.208 --> 05:36:05.218 align:start position:0%
that I have no more pink cards I'm going
 
05:36:07.070 --> 05:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on Senate
 
05:36:11.628 --> 05:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
Bill 167 and conclude our activity for
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
the day I'll remind members that we're
 
05:36:17.830 --> 05:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
meeting again next Monday the 17th of
 
05:36:21.288 --> 05:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
April and potentially next Tuesday the
 
05:36:21.298 --> 05:36:23.030 align:start position:0%
April and potentially next Tuesday the
18th

05:36:23.030 --> 05:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
18th
 
05:36:25.970 --> 05:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
that will depend almost entirely on how
 
05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
long it takes us to get through the
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
remaining Senate bills I believe there
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
are three of them
 
05:36:33.410 --> 05:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
because we want to do an exact session
 
05:36:36.050 --> 05:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
after that so if it takes us six hours
 
05:36:38.990 --> 05:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
to get through those three bills then we
 
05:36:41.150 --> 05:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
may not finish our exact session on
 
05:36:43.310 --> 05:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
Monday we may carry over into Tuesday
 
05:36:45.550 --> 05:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to notice it for both days
 
05:36:47.570 --> 05:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGee you had a question
 
05:36:49.788 --> 05:36:49.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I wanted to
 
05:36:52.250 --> 05:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
revisit the concept of having a work
 
05:36:56.390 --> 05:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
session on Senate bill 166.
 
05:36:58.550 --> 05:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
we said we would discuss it after but if
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
we break now and don't come back till
 
05:37:01.730 --> 05:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
Monday we will we'll have lost another
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
week so I'm just wondering whether
 
05:37:05.628 --> 05:37:05.638 align:start position:0%
there's any place that we can fit in a
 
05:37:07.368 --> 05:37:07.378 align:start position:0%
time for that and add it to the schedule
 
05:37:12.110 --> 05:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:12.120 --> 05:37:12.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:37:12.890 --> 05:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
why don't I schedule the work session on
 
05:37:15.120 --> 05:37:16.490 align:start position:0%
why don't I schedule the work session on
one

05:37:16.490 --> 05:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:37:19.550 --> 05:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
66 for the first order of business next
 
05:37:19.560 --> 05:37:20.810 align:start position:0%
66 for the first order of business next
Monday

05:37:20.810 --> 05:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we can spend an hour talking about
 
05:37:24.590 --> 05:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
it and then we'll do the public hearings
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
on the remaining Senate bills how's that
 
05:37:28.368 --> 05:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
that'll be great and in order to do it
 
05:37:29.628 --> 05:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
in that amount of time I hope people
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
will do their homework and come prepared
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
to talk about what they think should be
 
05:37:35.208 --> 05:37:35.218 align:start position:0%
in the bill if anything
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative Munns I had a
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you Mr chair I was
 
05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
going to ask similar question about 167
 
05:37:43.128 --> 05:37:43.138 align:start position:0%
I mean there seems to be a lot of
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
amendments floating around on that on
 
05:37:48.050 --> 05:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
that is that worth having a work session
 
05:37:51.288 --> 05:37:51.298 align:start position:0%
or subcommittee to try to craft a single
 
05:37:54.110 --> 05:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that potentially would work
 
05:37:55.970 --> 05:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
well we do need to craft a single
 
05:37:57.890 --> 05:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment because you can't come out of
 
05:38:00.050 --> 05:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
committee with multiple amendments
 
05:38:01.788 --> 05:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
you can't do floor amendments like you
 
05:38:04.490 --> 05:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
can on the house floor so we do need a
 
05:38:06.288 --> 05:38:06.298 align:start position:0%
single Amendment whether it's a
 
05:38:09.650 --> 05:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
combination of the McGee Kaplan and
 
05:38:11.868 --> 05:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
Waters Amendment or
 
05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
some different Amendment we do need an
 
05:38:14.520 --> 05:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
some different Amendment we do need an
amendment

05:38:16.070 --> 05:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:38:19.010 --> 05:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
um why not I let since the two of you
 
05:38:20.750 --> 05:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment why don't I let
 
05:38:24.110 --> 05:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
you guys work out what a joint Amendment
 
05:38:25.850 --> 05:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
would look like you have a copy of
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters Amendment
 
05:38:28.080 --> 05:38:29.448 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters Amendment
okay

05:38:29.448 --> 05:38:29.458 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay I'll get you one representative
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%

05:38:39.288 --> 05:38:39.298 align:start position:0%
sheet and online numbers for the four
 
05:38:41.090 --> 05:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
bills that we heard today representative
 
05:38:42.890 --> 05:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
closure would give those to us if he
 
05:38:44.810 --> 05:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
were here but he's not uh you want to do
 
05:38:44.820 --> 05:38:45.830 align:start position:0%
were here but he's not uh you want to do
it

05:38:45.830 --> 05:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:38:48.650 --> 05:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
okay I'm happy to do it sure uh go see
 
05:38:48.660 --> 05:38:49.670 align:start position:0%
okay I'm happy to do it sure uh go see
represent

05:38:49.670 --> 05:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:38:52.368 --> 05:38:52.378 align:start position:0%
um Christy officer our
 
05:38:53.930 --> 05:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
committee researchers she'll give you
 
05:38:59.510 --> 05:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:01.730 --> 05:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
so let me find a copy of the senator
 
05:39:08.570 --> 05:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
would you hand this to representative
 
05:39:10.320 --> 05:39:33.070 align:start position:0%
would you hand this to representative
McGee

05:39:33.070 --> 05:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:34.910 --> 05:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
