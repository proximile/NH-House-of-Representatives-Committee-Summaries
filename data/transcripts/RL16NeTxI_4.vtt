um i wanted to take a quick minute and
do

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
start off with the pledge of allegiance
 
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
we'll do that on at every meeting
 
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
um if everybody why don't uh bob you
 
00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 align:start position:0%

lead us off here sure
 
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
well i i even have a flag here like this
 
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
oh well i got one right over there okay
 
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:10.630 align:start position:0%
 
justice

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
if i was technologically advanced i
 
00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
would just be able to post
 
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
up a nice waving flag or something like
 
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
it didn't work um anyway uh
 
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
i wanted to aside from me i wanted to be
 
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
officers i guess uh bob greene
 
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
is for me over in the upper right corner
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
will be vice chair
 
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
there's bob's hand and uh and our clerk
 
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
will be vanessa sheehan um
 
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
vanessa's probably um
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
new to everyone here um i've never met
 
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
vanessa in in person we've had quite a
 
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
few phone calls vanessa is a
 
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
freshman representative so we'll have
 
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
every chance in the world to
 
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh to play dastardly tricks on vanessa
 
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
here along the way
 
00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
um vanessa why don't yeah if you
 
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind uh
 
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
and i am i'm still a little curious too
 
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
um i've not heard who will be the the
 
00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 align:start position:0%
um uh ranking member on the democratic
 
00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
level are you
 
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
i am okay i thought so so
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
uh we have to call you ex-chairman or
 
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
um chairman emeritus or something like
 
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.070 align:start position:0%
um chairman emeritus or something like
that

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start position:0%

ranking member i'm in my 18th term
 
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
and very happy to be with this committee
 
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
good group of people we've got some
 
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
interesting issues
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
this year doug ray is a deputy ranking
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
damn is doug
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
available yep right there
 
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
yep hi dad um hello that's that's
 
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.790 align:start position:0%
yep hi dad um hello that's that's
important

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh and and most of this conversation is
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
for the folks that
 
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
are our new colleagues more than
 
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.830 align:start position:0%
are our new colleagues more than
anything

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
everyone else um our old pals and
 
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
and we've already heard this probably 15
 
00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
and we've already heard this probably 15
times

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
each this is one of the most experienced
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
groups i think that um exists in the
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
house if you
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
added up everybody's hours of service
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
which um
 
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
is a good and a bad thing it's a
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
double-edged sword for the uh
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
for their their freshman representatives
 
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.430 align:start position:0%
for their their freshman representatives
um

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
part of that is good because you'll be
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
um learn from some real experienced
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
representatives obviously the bad part
 
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
representatives obviously the bad part
is

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
um we may tend to talk in
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
in um shorthand at some point and uh
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
and we may tend to go a little faster
 
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.789 align:start position:0%
and we may tend to go a little faster
than

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
you may like so i'm giving you
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
open invitation at this point to um
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
stop us at any point um and
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
and ask you know where are we what are
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
we doing
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
it's actually one of the reasons that i
 
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
asked vanessa to be
 
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
our clerk uh because i figure vanessa
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
will be sitting
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
next to me and can jab me with a sharp
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
pen and say
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
stop you i don't know what you're saying
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
please slow down or do some of those
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
things so
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
um this is this is gonna be
 
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
a learning curve for a lot of us um
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
because of the zoom and and the way that
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
we're operating
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
but but we have a slight advantage the
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
people that have been here
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
before because we know at least some of
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
um if you can think about the the uh
 
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
the poor freshmen um they've got to
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
learn the process and
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
um incorporate all of their zooms at the
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
and and as um we just heard a few
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
minutes ago
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
some of this is still yet to be ironed
 
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.790 align:start position:0%
some of this is still yet to be ironed
out

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
so um we're we're all in the same boat
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
so feel free anytime anytime there's a
 
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.790 align:start position:0%
so feel free anytime anytime there's a
question

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
to just uh just stop us
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
and and find out what's going on um we
 
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
used to have a rep named david murakami
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
some of us remember him
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
david was a rep from nashua
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
i steal from him frequently
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
um a line that he used um starting any
 
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.710 align:start position:0%
um a line that he used um starting any
meeting

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it and he used to say i'm really
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
good with names
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm really good with faces i'm just
 
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
not really good at putting the two of
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
them together
 
00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 align:start position:0%
so i'll do everything i can
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
to make sure i know everyone
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
i would it's a little more difficult
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
with zoom
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
than it is with individual meeting of
 
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.350 align:start position:0%
than it is with individual meeting of
people

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
um i'm much more
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
used to being able to talk to somebody
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
in the hallways of the lob
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
and and getting to know them that way
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's it it's impossible on zoom i think
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
um and i think that's one of the
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
problems with it that
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
that we'll find it that legislating
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
isn't as easy as it
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
used to be when you see somebody in the
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
um i also need to
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
i would be remiss if i didn't um make
 
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.550 align:start position:0%
i would be remiss if i didn't um make
sure

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
everyone realized that uh we have
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
probably well not probably we have
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
the top committee researcher in the
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
whole organization maybe in the world
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
so we are blessed with having
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
pam smarling here with us today
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
for for everyone that um
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
has not met pam i encourage you to take
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
a few minutes and do that
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
pam um as our researcher
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
will be well i should let pam describe
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
what she does rather than putting words
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
into her
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
into her mouth go ahead pam if you have
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's what i'm here for um
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
and you'll all realize that you've
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
you've also got a chairman
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's prone to hyperbole but that's
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
the way yeah that's true that is true so
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
um i i am pam smarling i i
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
serve as the researcher for the
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee and a resource in general
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
i mean as legislation is filed
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
with the committee i provide background
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
research legislative history
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the chairman you know would
 
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.710 align:start position:0%
whatever the chairman you know would
like

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
that's that's possible to obtain um
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
i try to give to you in advance of the
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
hearing um
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
if that's how the question comes or if
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's after the hearing sometimes a
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
question is raised then
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i can answer after the fact before
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
you vote on the bill clearly
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
i do work you know it's an important for
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
you to know that i work for three other
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know committees the house commerce
 
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.990 align:start position:0%
you know committees the house commerce
committee

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
executive departments and administration
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
and election law
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
um so they are very busy committees and
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
all like voted to be
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
in on all the places at once but i am
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
accessible to you by email
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
is probably the best way or or certainly
 
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:29.270 align:start position:0%
is probably the best way or or certainly
phone

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
um and i've been around for a while i've
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
been around for
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
over 30 years so i i do have some
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
some uh extensive background files
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i look forward to working with all of
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
you and going forward
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
um as as the one thing that i will
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
mention here is
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
um access to pam and and
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
access to pam's work
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm requiring all of that come through
 
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
i'm requiring all of that come through
me

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
that is that's pretty standard operating
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
procedure in here that
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
the chair needs to know what's going on
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
and pam doesn't need uh
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
whatever we have 15 masters um
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't help pam and it
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't help the process of the work
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so anything comes through me that
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
um we also have a committee assistant
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
um and i have to confess i've not met
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
carrie before um some of you may
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
i i am hearing great things
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think we'll have
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
obviously any issues same rules
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
kerry is um is assigned to us
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
kerry also has other committees which i
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't know do you know pam the other
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
committees that she is
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know no okay um
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
but at some point we'll meet carrie as
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
well and um
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
and have her introduce herself to all of
 
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.870 align:start position:0%
and have her introduce herself to all of
us

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
then we so i guess from there where i
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
want to head
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
most everyone here is anxious i'm sure
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
to hear about two topics
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
um committee hearings and executive
 
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.990 align:start position:0%
um committee hearings and executive
sessions

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
um committee hearings are going to be
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
set up in a
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
in a hybrid model i would call it and i
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
should point out too
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
everything i'm going to tell you from
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
here on out is as i understand it
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
now there are some things that are still
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
being ironed out i believe
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
but we will be operating committee
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
hearings on a hybrid
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
model hopefully some of us will
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
be in the lob i plan to always be in the
 
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.630 align:start position:0%
be in the lob i plan to always be in the
lob

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
lob
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
for hearings um
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
you can certainly zoom in to the
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
hearings and we'll operate kind of
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
as we are right now i guess um
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
there are plans for and i think they
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
were installed yesterday or today do you
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
know pam the
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
air exchangers that um i saw them on
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
friday being
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
carried into the rooms okay well there
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
you go you're ahead of me
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
um i thought they were coming in uh um
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
maybe they said they would be activated
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
as of today right
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
or just in boxes you know so it wasn't
 
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.910 align:start position:0%
or just in boxes you know so it wasn't
wasn't

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
installed but they were so the theory is
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
that that will
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
um make make us safe
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
so the option still exists for hearings
 
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:46.630 align:start position:0%
so the option still exists for hearings
where

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
um the public will be um
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh on zoom we will um
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
have some members in person that's
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's how that will stand and that's
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
why it's important for me to get used to
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
or or bob as our technological uh
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
leader um to figure out how to promote
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
people to
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
um to being able to talk and to provide
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
testimony after all that is
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
our uh raise on that that's our reason
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
to be here
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
um to hear from public and uh and to
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
pay attention everything else
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
from the committee hearing portion
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
um committee hearings will be as normal
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
um we will do virtually everything we've
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
always done
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
we will be attentive we will um
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
not be i i'm certain none of us will be
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
um balancing our checkbooks or or
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
competing with facebook or eating cocoa
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
crispies while we're watching
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
um any of our
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
any of our people coming and testifying
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
i will also ask them for this
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
the same courtesy um
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
i don't need you know parking dogs and
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
every other thing in the background
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
while we're trying to pay attention to
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
what they're
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing um i also i'm a stickler
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
on making sure that the information that
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
they give us is
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
um is pertinent and is not re
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
repetitive um if at all possible i
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
understand that uh
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
some people may come in and not see what
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
has been taught
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier so we may have to
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
put up with some of it but um
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
likewise i don't think it's a good idea
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
as i talk about
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
cocoa crispies i don't think it's a good
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
idea for us to have anything
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
on our desks that appear like we are not
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
paying attention to
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
um the panelists so if we are or the
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
attendees actually
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
um so you know it would be great if um
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have uh anything
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
um like kung pao chicken or something
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
for lunch or
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
or a mixing bowl or anything that we're
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
doing trying to
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
multitask we are here to see those
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
attendees and listen to their
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
them educate us um everything else works
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
the same you um
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
if you can get my attention with a
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
raised hand i'll make sure you're on a
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
list and you're called and you can ask
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
the attendees any
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
questions you want um follow-ups are all
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
everything comes through the chair just
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
like we've always done
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that i can make this work as
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
easily and as seamlessly as it always
 
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.750 align:start position:0%
easily and as seamlessly as it always
has

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
if i can do half as good a job as
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
our previous chairperson then i'm be
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
tickled pink so um that's
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
that's great up there's a hand go
 
00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.269 align:start position:0%
that's great up there's a hand go
whatever

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah good how are you i'm representative
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
beth richards i think this is our first
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
time to kind of
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
meet yes um in semi-person but uh
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
quick question to follow up on um the
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
hybrid model
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
and um would and your comment about the
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
kung pao chicken
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
um do you have to be kung pao chicken
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead um but uh
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
do you if we are hybrid in do you want
 
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
do you if we are hybrid in do you want
us

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
face like this um potentially a
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
background or
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
are we able to just be name only or
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
a stock photo so
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
for my preference it would be great if
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
if the attendees actually saw who they
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
are it's a little off-putting for me
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
um to just have a symbol uh
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know right now all i'm seeing of
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
janet is just a telephone symbol
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
um i i think
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
we should try to make this as much as
 
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.790 align:start position:0%
we should try to make this as much as
possible

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
as a real hearing um i think we should
 
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.030 align:start position:0%
as a real hearing um i think we should
be

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
um having people be able to talk to all
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
even though we look like the brady bunch
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
up here um
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
it is i think it's important to have
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
yeah sure um right now i'm in my
 
00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:19.350 align:start position:0%
yeah sure um right now i'm in my
business

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
um alone in my office
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
but there will be times i imagine
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
my children are in a hybrid model as
 
00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.110 align:start position:0%
my children are in a hybrid model as
well

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
with their school and so when we all get
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
on um
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
if i'm in the home situation depending
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
on the date
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
um there i imagine
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
and have experienced that it would be
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
better for me at times to be able to
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
turn off my videos so that
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
if they need to be doing something that
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
demands more
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
so um can i we find it
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine okay so can i understand
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
who is saying
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
to the best of our ability um to be
 
00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:02.710 align:start position:0%
to the best of our ability um to be
present

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
and at times when we can't either via
 
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:05.829 align:start position:0%
and at times when we can't either via
phone

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
or for streaming or other things to
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
be a name or a picture right as i
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
anticipate it we will all be
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
muted um with with the exception of me
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
probably um and then um
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
and then so if if your children are
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
um interrupting you they're not
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
interrupting us
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
um and and so feel free
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
you know obviously there's no style
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
points for
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
for any of this so they're teenagers so
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
talk to me but uh it'll be more on
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%

chairman i i
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
neglected to um make sure that you read
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
the script at the opening of the
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
roll call so that we knew where we are
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%

um learning curve it's all part of the
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
learning curve
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
um i think we so we left off
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
um with the committee hearings that
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
and i think we covered everything there
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
unless there was any
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
concerns or questions about that um
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
could i make a comment mr joe i was just
 
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.630 align:start position:0%
could i make a comment mr joe i was just
gonna

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah i just wanted to note that
 
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.190 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah i just wanted to note that
um

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
we we do need to use the elect better to
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
use the electronic
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
um hand raising feature
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
so it's it's natural and you know a more
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
casual setting to just
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
raise your hand i can't raise my hand
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
electronically because i'm the host
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
and i guess presumably i
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know shouldn't have to but um all of
 
00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
you know shouldn't have to but um all of
you

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
have the ability to raise your hand by
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
by pressing the button at the end of the
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
bottom of the participants list there
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
a raised hand option
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
probably um a co-host might not have
 
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.470 align:start position:0%
probably um a co-host might not have
that

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
but it's something to be aware of and
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
when you do raise your hand
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
you um pop to the top of the list
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the order that those hands are raised
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
so the chairman can
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
call you in invoices yeah it is nice and
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
and you may sometimes deviate from that
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
i know if somebody has spoken a number
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
of times
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
you might say i'm gonna skip that person
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
because you know the second person
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
hasn't spoken at all yet
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know so that it's obviously your
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
choice but
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's handy because that happens in
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
the attendee side and also the panelists
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
side and it just
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
helps you maintain order do you know
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
pam y on my screen anyway
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
so claire claire's hand is raised but
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
then the
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
others are just a blinking red dot
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
is that is that indicating that they are
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry claire's hand um the others
 
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.149 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry claire's hand um the others
don't

00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
i i don't get i don't get any others
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
are you referring to the breaking red
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
dot that's in the uh participant window
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes because that means that just means
 
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.230 align:start position:0%
yes because that means that just means
we're

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
recording the meeting right for the
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
three of us hosts i think that's what
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
that refers to
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
it is yes yeah it's that
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
cloud with a red dot in it it's a what
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know it looks like a it's like a
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
cloud symbol yeah
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um okay so that means that uh
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
only the co-hosts are being recorded no
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
no no no the whole meeting
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
is being recorded i i frankly don't know
 
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:41.669 align:start position:0%
is being recorded i i frankly don't know
why

00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
the request i think it just it just
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
reminds us
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we control that so claire's hand is
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
raised does that mean claire you would
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
no yes okay
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
my question is and i and i heard uh
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
everything i think about the hearings
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
and the hybrid the options for zoom in
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
the public for zoom
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
did we talk about exact session at all
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
and or did i miss that
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
um you have not missed that but i
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
haven't finished with the
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
with the committee hearing yet okay
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's some requirements with that as
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
well that need to be
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um done pam do you have something else
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
first i just
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
while we're sort of still talking about
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
raising hands
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that representative
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
ruyard's hand is still
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
up she can lower it too and i think it's
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
handy if you
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
if each member raises and lowers their
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
own hands it's
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's otherwise they all stay up or or
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
you as the host can lower them
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
right but it's not it's one less thing
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
to do if
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
members raise their own hand and lower
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
it once they're recognized
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah oh sure this is this is
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
what we're here for to
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
kind of thing like having a rehearsed uh
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
committee meeting um so there are also
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
in this hybrid model we also have
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
um to the committee and
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
one of which is you need to notify
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
bob the vice chair whether you intend to
 
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.149 align:start position:0%
bob the vice chair whether you intend to
be

00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
in person or on zoom for that hearing
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that has to do with making
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
the link goes to you that's correct and
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we end up with
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
everyone using the the panel list call
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
in and zoom link rather than
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
using the public one um which gets
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
a little bit to janet's question about
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
why does she show up as an
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
attendee rather than a panelist on on
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
here but um
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
i would think um it shouldn't be much
 
00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:56.830 align:start position:0%
i would think um it shouldn't be much
different

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
much of a heavy lift for people to just
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
get in touch with bob and say i plan on
 
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.950 align:start position:0%
get in touch with bob and say i plan on
being

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
in on zoom where i plan on being in the
 
00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:06.630 align:start position:0%
in on zoom where i plan on being in the
hearing

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
is that correct pam is that the reason
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
why so that we know
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
who's who's here and why or where
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
well so we know who to send the links to
 
00:29:18.399 --> 00:29:18.789 align:start position:0%
well so we know who to send the links to
and

00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
who to anticipate in the building so
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
we're aware of who's in the building and
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that the seating will work and
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
whatever else might need to be done in
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
the room itself
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
to that end i would think we need to
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
have one
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
email address for everyone that's going
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
to be used
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
for this transmission of the link for
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
for zoom and we also need one telephone
 
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.830 align:start position:0%
for zoom and we also need one telephone
number

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
so that we can identify who's calling in
 
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
so that we can identify who's calling in
and

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
and put them in the right spot i would
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
guess that's correct too pam
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay so um
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
if that can be provided um we really
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
don't have a chat
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
area or something but how would you like
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
pam that information to be transmitted
 
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:11.430 align:start position:0%
pam that information to be transmitted
to

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
you or does that stay with bob
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
what that single number for everyone
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
the idea would be to use the same email
 
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.669 align:start position:0%
the idea would be to use the same email
address

00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
for all your legislative business
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
including the zoom
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
um links so that is
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
smith for um you know i think yesterday
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
he sent out an
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh an email to all members with that
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
request so if the clerk's office knows
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
um you know has that information then
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
then i can
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
get it from him for all of my committees
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
as so we have that central
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
location and then phone numbers
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
i think would be the same thing
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
to email me um as well
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay me on what you're sending me send
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
to paul just so i
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
have it as well but paul really is the
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
the central processing for
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
for contact information okay
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
um it's also a cautionary note that um
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
no one will
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
share that zoom link to with anyone else
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
um i asked today for
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
the the public email link um
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
which is available to share but um but
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
not the individual one that is sent to
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
each of us
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
um correct pam
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct if you share your
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
personal link
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
then we'd have a bunch of greg hills
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
is what's posted in the house calendar
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's publicly available
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
and therefore certainly very
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate to share all the committee
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
hearings will be
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
recorded will be on youtube um
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
even though the public will be
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
testifying only on
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
zoom um
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's everything i have on the
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
committee hearings anybody else have
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
you're good doug um no i just wanted to
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
just be clear so
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
if i just want to know for sure who do
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
we if i'm going to attend remotely or if
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to attend remotely
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
what's the advance notice you need how
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
how much in advance and
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
exactly who do we send it to do we send
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
it to bob uh representative green i'm
 
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:39.830 align:start position:0%
it to bob uh representative green i'm
sorry

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
um or do we uh and and how far in
 
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.509 align:start position:0%
um or do we uh and and how far in
advance

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
advance
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
would be necessary i just i just think i
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
just want to have that nailed down
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
i would say it's 24 hours um how i think
 
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.870 align:start position:0%
i would say it's 24 hours um how i think
the

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
the catch is it pam when does the link
 
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:56.549 align:start position:0%
the catch is it pam when does the link
get

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
sent and then there's a reminder an hour
 
00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.669 align:start position:0%
sent and then there's a reminder an hour
before

00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
i'm caught in the binder i've been doing
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
it two days in advance
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
myself i know we're it we're entering
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
you know a general protocol that's
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's being developed right now so i
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's going to continue
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
to be the protocol
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that we'll know soon and then
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
really firm up these these questions
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
it should go to representative green or
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee assistant or
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
i think it would be handy for for
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
multiple community
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
services to know that or who i'm sorry
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
house committee services somebody in my
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
office you know
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
so again i'm going to make i'm making a
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
note of it you know
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
ann fitzgerald has asked us to to you
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
know maintain a list of all these types
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
of issues and questions to make sure
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're included in the final
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
protocols and so we'll okay
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
so to be determined i guess but but it
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
two days is the default at this point 48
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
hours is the default and then if it
 
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.430 align:start position:0%
hours is the default and then if it
changes

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
i will let everyone know
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
there was one other thing that popped
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
into my head well oh and
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
so at this point i'll i'll go a little
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
bit behind the scenes
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
at um at some point all committee
 
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.710 align:start position:0%
at um at some point all committee
hearings

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
we are going to have a double room
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
um in order to maintain social
 
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.750 align:start position:0%
um in order to maintain social
distancing

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
distancing
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
at some point shortly i hope we will
 
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:41.909 align:start position:0%
at some point shortly i hope we will
have

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
the schedule of what days we will be
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
assigned for that double room
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
and um and that my understanding is we
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
will have the double room for
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
that day so it would be nice
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
just based on the number of bills we
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
have it would seem that we could almost
 
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.390 align:start position:0%
have it would seem that we could almost
do

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know two full days um of hearings
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
and have that single double room and
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then schedule exec sessions and then
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
be out of here
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
um but that's the plan as it stands
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
i haven't i don't know what that day is
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
i've only heard from one person
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
so far that of a day that they can't
 
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:22.950 align:start position:0%
so far that of a day that they can't
make

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
um hearings so it may be a good idea if
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
you shoot me a text or an email or
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
something and say
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
um you know these are these are
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
impossible days for me
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
um i i'm hopeful
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
that it's going to work out so everybody
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
is available when
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be especially where
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have to drive
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
who knows an hour or two hours or three
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
hours to get here you know if you can
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
just take an hour out of your day
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
and be available for hearings that would
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
be great
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
um as soon as i know what day we've been
 
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.470 align:start position:0%
um as soon as i know what day we've been
assigned

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
assigned
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's when i'll start working on
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
scheduling the hearings
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the more information that you give me
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
the better
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
um as far as trying to schedule all of
 
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
um as far as trying to schedule all of
this

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
um that should cover hearings executive
 
00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
um that should cover hearings executive
sessions

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
um executive sessions will be
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
in person um executive sessions will be
 
00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
in person um executive sessions will be
in

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
the lob in this this room assigned to us
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have um the opportunity to zoom
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
executive sessions um that's
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
that's how things will be done we will
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
ask that all representatives if you can
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
make the if you can't make the executive
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
session you contact your
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
ranking member or maybe your deputy
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
ranking member i don't know that's up to
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
ranking member i don't know that's up to
you

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask all republicans will
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
get a hold of me
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
or vice chair green and
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
and let us know that's for purposes of
 
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
and let us know that's for purposes of
substitutes

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
substitutes
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
um more than anything else
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
and at this point as soon as we know
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a great i you know
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
our first hearing i would think
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a whole bunch of new
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
information to be shared
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
i don't intend to
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
hold executive sessions on the days of
 
00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:34.150 align:start position:0%
hold executive sessions on the days of
hearings

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's my intention who knows if in the
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
middle of a hearing we all look at each
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
other and say
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
this is a great idea let's all do it now
 
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.030 align:start position:0%
this is a great idea let's all do it now
um

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
that will be noticed in the calendar
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
that we can do that
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
um but um but we will
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully hold all our hearings and then
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
hold uh
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
i would think an executive session day
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
and um and obviously if we can't do
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're going to be doing um
 
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:04.950 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're going to be doing um
zoom

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
meetings and there's going to be a
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
hybrid setup of
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
in person and out of person or
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
in zoom in and in the lob
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
we really can't do an executive session
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
anyway if we're going to do
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
all of them in person so
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
that kind of will take care of itself
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
and that's all the questions i have
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
or all the answers i have at the moment
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any questions on
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
executive sessions i don't see any hands
 
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.310 align:start position:0%
executive sessions i don't see any hands
raised

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have three people with us today
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think that we invited
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
and these for the freshmen are usually
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
these are our um
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know round up the usual suspects
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
kind of people um
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
they are with us often in the in the
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee room
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to give them the opportunity
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
to address you
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
and tell you a little bit about what
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
um it looks to me like terry
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
is the only oh no jim's on here as well
 
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.030 align:start position:0%
is the only oh no jim's on here as well
so

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
right now we have terry path
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
harry can i promote you or allow you to
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
talk here i'm going to try to get you
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
promote you to a panelist
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
there yet you see him
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
he's in a panelist column oh there we go

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
a little lag he's somewhere in between
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
for a while but yeah
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like star trek when you uh
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
when they're
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
transmitted from yeah there looks like
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm transmitted aboard the starship
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
yeah there you go oh look where you are
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%

business of the legislature
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
on and that's about the uh upcoming
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussion on the uh on the portraits
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
and different collections throughout the
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
facility and there's a jurisdiction
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
issue that she's going to address with
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
her piece of legislation so i'll be
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
visiting you
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
testifying on that piece of legislation
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
but it's uh it's great to meet the new
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
members and
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
the former members and returning members
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
i should say
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh good to see you guys again and it'll
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
be interesting to see how this
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
all plans out now one of the areas of
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility i have is the gcts
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
division which is our it division and
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's been really uh
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
put to the test and we've done a lot of
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
recent building with our
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
it platforms lately and actually
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
preliminarily leading up to the pandemic
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
which i wouldn't say is foresight i
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
thought it was uh it was more or less a
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
necessity because
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
we had so many legacy programs that we
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
were using to
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
promote our legislative process we
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
really had to get a consultant on board
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
and rebuild our whole platforms
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
right up and including our disaster
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
recovery platforms
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
so fortunately we did that we went to
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
the cloud we have the ability with teams
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
software programs that we put in place
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
as well as rebuilding our full
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
server base and software protection and
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
virus protection capabilities so we've
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work there as well
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
so again i will be visiting you on a led
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation that
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh that affect what i do and i oversee
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll also be available on a regular
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
basis along with attorney
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
um cianci it's a question uh
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
historically that we have some
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
experience with
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
that may come up within your committee
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman as always if
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%

00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%

issue or information you need i'm always
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
available for this committee
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
as any committee's really in the whole
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
general court but this one i'm in front
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%

00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
when pieces of legislation come up
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
affect the operations of the legislature
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%

information

00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
paul terry and myself tend to
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
take an interest in this committee
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
because this committee's purview
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
is uh over matters which uh involve the
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
legislature itself sort of its internal
 
00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
legislature itself sort of its internal
workings

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
workings
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
so we tend to keep an eye out on those
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
issues and to provide you with the best
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%

on the hybrid uh model over zoom
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're not aware that that any decision
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
has been made that those are going to
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
have to be in person um and that's of
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%

um for uh for an executive session
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%

to verify
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%

uh to our new section of mason's manual
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
that that does have a brand new chapter
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
on remote hearings
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
um in in sort of establishing guidelines
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
on determining
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
this is all good reason why we have you
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
folks here today
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
so is there were there any other items
 
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:09.990 align:start position:0%
so is there were there any other items
that

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
came up in the chairs meeting that
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
obviously i missed that uh
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
that should have been that should be of
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
interest to
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
the committee uh actually uh yes mr
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
chairman if you don't mind um
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
i i would just would just let you know
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
that there is going to be a new um
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh a new tool for testifying on
 
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.829 align:start position:0%
uh a new tool for testifying on
legislation

00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh that is being worked out on our web
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
where people will be able to file
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
essentially a pink card
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
right out on the website and at the end
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
of of their
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
sort of registration process there is an
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
email link that will direct
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
them to send an email to the committee
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
if they have testimony that they wish to
 
00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:53.829 align:start position:0%
if they have testimony that they wish to
be

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
included so this is this is something
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
literally has been rolled out today um
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
and uh it is if you're interested to see
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
how it looks it is actually live on the
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
senate uh page as well
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
they they uh they started this week uh
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
in earnest with their hearings as well
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and have been utilizing the system
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh some of the back end uh stuff on how
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh to um determine the order of
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and those sorts of things
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
those those details will be worked out
 
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.990 align:start position:0%
those those details will be worked out
individually

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
individually
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh with you and and your committee
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
technical person
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll we'll go from there
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to uh to mention that
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
that that is uh
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
that is sort of a new obviously piece to
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
our legislative landscape here
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
how about blue sheets uh so
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
so it's the same thing so essentially
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
what what it is is you
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
you sign up on the website and um
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's you either market you're you're in
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
favor or opposed
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you also uh mark if you want to
 
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
and you also uh mark if you want to
speak

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh so it's it's uh very similar to to
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
how we have it set up now except we've
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
sort of combined
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
both forms into one it actually would
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
look a lot like what we were used to
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
with the senate
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
it it yeah i i didn't want to use those
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
yes we are we are we are making those
 
00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.510 align:start position:0%
yes we are we are we are making those
folks

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
um anything else paul that you would
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
like to discuss with the committee
 
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
like to discuss with the committee
members

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh thanks mr chairman yes um i i i
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think you all know me um i'm paul
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
smith i'm your your house clerk
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
um you uh yes this is this is basically
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
the only committee i hang out in
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
um uh with with no disrespect to the
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
other committees this is the one
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
though that obviously has uh the most
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
meaning for
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh for for what we do internally in our
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
processes and that's why
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
you will see me from time to time uh
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
chiming in on legislation
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
um and and usually uh well always i
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
don't take a position on the legislation
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
i simply
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
present to you sort of information uh as
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
i have it historical pieces that sort of
 
00:49:58.559 --> 00:49:59.109 align:start position:0%
i have it historical pieces that sort of
thing

00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know if you do see me it's
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's not because
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
um i i'm unhappy or or i'm trying to
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
give you heartburn
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's just because i just uh you know
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
um well and i'm sure having looked at
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
the legislation that's before your
 
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.510 align:start position:0%
the legislation that's before your
committee

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you can you can understand why
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
you'll probably be seeing me
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
on some of those issues so the heartburn
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
a side benefit i know the heartburn is
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
is usually on my end
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
based on based on uh you know various
 
00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:32.690 align:start position:0%
interpretations of rules and whatnot
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:35.109 align:start position:0%
interpretations of rules and whatnot
[Laughter]

00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
so for um new members
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
you should realize that paul used to be
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
one of us
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
um how many years were you
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
just um you know it was it was it was a
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
long time ago uh when when i didn't have
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
any of these things
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
um yes when i was uh when i was actually
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
when i was a senior in college i ran for
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
a seat in the house
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i actually served on this committee
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
so that's why i
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
i and i was a clerk in my second term of
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
this committee so i obviously i feel a
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
great attachment to legislative
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
administration for
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons great
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
um i'm hopeful i didn't cut off jim did
 
00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:18.470 align:start position:0%
um i'm hopeful i didn't cut off jim did
you

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
um did you have a war that you wanted to
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
include or
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh we kind of got sidetracked with the
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
idea of uh
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
executive sessions thank you mr chairman
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually all i'll say is uh ditto
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
you'll tend to see the two of us
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
together because we
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know paul takes a lot of times the
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
historical aspect the rules aspect
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'll take the legal aspect they
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
intertwine and again
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
as paul said i'm i if i do come to
 
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.910 align:start position:0%
as paul said i'm i if i do come to
testify

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
it will never be to take a position on a
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
bill um but it will just
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
be to point out maybe technical defects
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
in a bill
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
or to provide you with information that
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
may not be apparent from the bill
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
as much as pam is your your researcher
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
and your resource for the committee
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
you should also consider and paul and
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
terry as you heard
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
as a resource to this committee just
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
based upon the nature of the
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
the subject matter that you deal with so
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um are either of you willing
 
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:17.990 align:start position:0%
thank you um are either of you willing
to

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
so representative richard i've
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
unmuted you um you have a question you
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
have your hand up
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
i do um thank you mr chairman
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
um paul you referenced um
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
the new section in masons
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
um and was that i forgive me i have not
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
read the entire calendar
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
um was that included in there or
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
a place for us to link and review that
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
section ourselves
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
well so um mason's
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
is unfortunately extremely copyrighted
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the um the various leadership
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
offices do have several copies
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
um and you are certainly able to
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
purchase a copy yourself
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
either a hardbound uh i will also
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
mention um that for the first time
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a digital version uh where
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
you can download the digital version
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
um and it is a a reduced cost you do
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
log in on the ncsl website ncsl
 
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.430 align:start position:0%
log in on the ncsl website ncsl
publishes

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
publishes
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
um the mason's manual every every 10
 
00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:31.349 align:start position:0%
um the mason's manual every every 10
years

00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
the the work however is produced by
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
my association the uh the american
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
society of legislative clerks and
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
secretaries we have a commission
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
that is a 10-year commission that works
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
on on updating those things
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
um but there is a new chapter chapter 57
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
um and it begins with 32 and it talks
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
specifically about
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh remote meetings and and the reason i
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
mention that is because although
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
um in our our rules that we've adopted
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
our emergency rules we reference
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
certain things um and and we also as you
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
heard at the beginning of the meeting
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
reference the governor's emergency order
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
and those sorts of things
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh there is guidance uh so in the event
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
that the emergency order goes away and
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
our rules expire
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
um there is guidance for how we could
 
00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:17.270 align:start position:0%
um there is guidance for how we could
conduct

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
um these these hearings in a remote
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
fashion um
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know provided we we do establish
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
some to do that
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
so so you know that's that's why i
 
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.230 align:start position:0%
so so you know that's that's why i
mentioned

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
specifically we we do sort of have some
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
some guidance
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
on on how to conduct these uh these
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
meetings beyond
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh just the emergency order which we've
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else i don't see any other hands
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
