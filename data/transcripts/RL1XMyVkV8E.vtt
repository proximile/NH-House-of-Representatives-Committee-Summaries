1338

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open the public hearing on
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
1338 an act establishing a committee to
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
study imposing attacks on manufacturers
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
based on the cost of
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
to dispose of single-use products and
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
product packaging materials
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is representative reed
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative reed you want to
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chair and thank you
 
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee for
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
welcoming me this is my first time ever
 
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
in my three terms to be before ways and
 
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
means i think it took me three terms to
 
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
work up the courage to put in anything
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
that would come before you
 
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 align:start position:0%
um and this is still just a study
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
nothing uh
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
still nothing too ambitious uh for the
 
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
record my name is ellen reed i represent
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
rockingham 17 new market and new fields
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
and um i want to start by actually i
 
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
want to start by saying the chair of the
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee that i clerk representative
 
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.110 align:start position:0%
committee that i clerk representative
lang

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
lang
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
is not here and i've already ripped him
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
good for for showing up late and missing
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
he is coming yes he is coming um but i
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
want to start um with kind of a
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situation
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
can you imagine
 
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.030 align:start position:0%
can you imagine
if

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
maybe in the days of the industrial
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
revolution and the factories started and
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
we had allowed them without any
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
restraint to continue dumping all the
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
toxic waste that they could create into
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
our rivers and streams unmitigated no
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
restrictions and instead of putting
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions on them what we did is we
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
demanded that every municipality create
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
a giant public spending program
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
at the taxpayers expense in order to go
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
and filter that waste out of the streams
 
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
and rivers that these companies were
 
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.749 align:start position:0%
and rivers that these companies were
polluting

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
polluting
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
can you imagine that giant massive
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
public spending program at the cost of
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers that we were allowing to
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
exist instead of simply requiring that
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
those manufacturers those companies
 
00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
those manufacturers those companies
either

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
not pollute those rivers or pay to clean
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
up those rivers
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
it would be an affront i think to
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
everyone of any political leaning that
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
we would do that to taxpayers
 
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
we would do that to taxpayers
and

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
the sad situation is that is exactly
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
what we've allowed to happen with solid
 
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.590 align:start position:0%
what we've allowed to happen with solid
waste

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
waste
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
essentially we've allowed companies with
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
no incentive on
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
reducing their packaging or reducing
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
their single use items or
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
making those items out of uh easier to
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
recycle or easier to dispose of
 
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.749 align:start position:0%
recycle or easier to dispose of
materials

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
we've given them no incentive to to be
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
conscientious about that
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
because we since the beginning have had
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
towns operate these solid waste
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
management programs at the expense of
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
so this the situation we have is
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
actually a well understood phenomenon in
 
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
economics it's called externalization
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
so our capitalist system is supposed to
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
work in that
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
you as a manufacturer or producer of a
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
product incorporate all the costs
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
associated with creating your product
 
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.830 align:start position:0%
associated with creating your product
into

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
the actual cost of the product and once
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
you take all those costs into effect you
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
sell that item at a profit and you work
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the competitive market in order to to
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
bring your costs down but we are not
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
doing that because they're allowed to
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
externalize the cost of these things
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
that they produce the disposal of these
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
so what happens is because they have no
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
incentive to reduce their cost reduce
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
their packaging make it out of easier to
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
dispose of materials they very
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
frequently will create products that
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
and this has been a well understood
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
phenomenon especially in food that have
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
bigger packaging but the same amount of
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
food in the packaging to make the
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
consumer think they're buying a bigger
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
product that's been over the last 15
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
years or so that that's been
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
a trend
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
and they also will make it fancier make
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
the package feel heavier all at the cost
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
again of taxpayers who have to
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
foot the bill for disposing of these
 
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.830 align:start position:0%
foot the bill for disposing of these
products

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
and as we know
 
00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:38.790 align:start position:0%
and as we know
whereas

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
recycling programs used to be relatively
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
easy still at a cost to the towns
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
because of the situation with china
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
towns in many many towns have had to
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
reduce their recycling programs much of
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
the waste ends up in landfills even
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
though the people of the town actually
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
think that they're recycling those
 
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
think that they're recycling those
materials

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
so this externalization of costs at the
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
expense of the taxpayer
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
is bad it is essentially theft they're
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
saying this is a cost we have associated
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
with creating a product but we're not
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
actually paying for that cost we're
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
letting someone else foot the bill
 
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.629 align:start position:0%
letting someone else foot the bill
um

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.909 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
if we could and make them internalize
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
those costs as they should then tax
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
rates for taxpayers will go down
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
especially in the form of property tax
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
which as we all know is uh very harsh in
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
this state because most of the mean the
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
solid waste is conducted on the
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
municipal level
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
so this idea
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
is that and it's
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's my idea that i've been kicking
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
around for five or six years
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
is that we simply tax manufacturers of
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
those goods single-use products or
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
a disposable packaging that we tax them
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
at a rate commensurate with how much it
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
costs for us to dispose of it
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
so if they're creating something that is
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
in a compostable or biodegradable
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
package or single-use product that would
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
be a very small amount if any if they're
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
doing something that's like a really
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
impossible or difficult to recycle
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
material or toxic material which many of
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
these materials are like styrofoam or
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
what have you
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
then we would tax them more and the idea
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
is that that money would then be
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
distributed to the entities mostly
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are actually having
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
to do the disposing and cover those
 
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.590 align:start position:0%
to do the disposing and cover those
costs

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
i obviously know
 
00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.110 align:start position:0%
i obviously know
that

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is uh well first of all that we
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the market share in the
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
country to kind of impact the
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and put incentive on them
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
in this way so i've proposed that the
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
study include the idea of an interstate
 
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.670 align:start position:0%
study include the idea of an interstate
uh

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
an interstate uh
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
what's the word
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
compact yes thank you i couldn't buy i
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't reach for the word an
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
interstate compact um so that if a
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
certain amount of certain percentage of
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
the population of the country were to
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
sign on then it would go into effect
 
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.190 align:start position:0%
sign on then it would go into effect
um

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.389 align:start position:0%
um
also

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
also
the

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
hold on if you think about i imagine and
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
this is just speculation because this is
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
just a study and i'm just i don't have
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
the expertise to put an actual
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
full-fledged bill before you but i'm
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
asking for for us to study this new idea
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
that most likely the tax would be mere
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
pennies on a product
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
if you think about the actual cost of
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
actually disposing of for example a
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
anyway uh
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
i guess that's basically everything i
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
have here to cover
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
the it's a new idea
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's has a lot of potential i
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
know new ideas are scary but we haven't
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
studied it before i know a lot of people
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
have reticence in doing another study
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
committee but this is one that hasn't
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
been done so i ask that you understand
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that this is worth a look and and uh
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
vote to have a study committee on this
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll happily take questions
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
representative reed
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about an interstate
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
compact do you know of any other states
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
that have a similar bill before them
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
that or we want to be the tip of the
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
sword here
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
on this issue i think on an inter yes i
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't know of any states that have this
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
particular idea like i said this came
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
out of my own noggin
 
00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.389 align:start position:0%
out of my own noggin
but

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
i think for an interstate compact it's
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
pretty safe to be the tip of the sword
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
right because she doesn't go into effect
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
until other states do sign on so
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's okay to be the tip of the sword in
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
that case
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
uh representative elmi followed by
 
00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:52.389 align:start position:0%
uh representative elmi followed by
representatives

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
representative reed
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
is there on i'm sorry actually that this
 
00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:02.069 align:start position:0%
is there on i'm sorry actually that this
bill

00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
was titled with the word tax in it yeah
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
me too i'm not sure
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
there is a large amount of study on
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
landfills going on in
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
and would you
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
do you think that there is enough
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
information about what is easily
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
recyclable and what isn't
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
that um this wouldn't have to be covered
 
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.269 align:start position:0%
that um this wouldn't have to be covered
first

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
i might add i'm
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
i'm from lebanon city of lebanon the
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
landfill manager there is the most
 
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
landfill manager there is the most
uh

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.550 align:start position:0%
uh
creative

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
creative
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
maybe in quite a few states
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the country and on has been teaching
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
us about what
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
can be recycled by him which is totally
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
different than what can be recycled by
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
casella et cetera et cetera and um
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if there's any kind of
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
the landfill operators around the
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
country have have put together enough
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
information about in general i mean you
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
can point out to styrofoam but the fact
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that black plastic is less recyclable
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
than clear plastic
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
in most places but not all
 
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
in most places but not all
uh

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
makes could make this difficult if that
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
hasn't been ironed out yet
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
what do you know about that thank you
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'm so glad you brought this up because
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
it is a point that i was struggling to
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
remember as i was going through but i
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
intended to talk about it so um so
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
the understanding the physical science
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
the material science of the actual
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
materials is well understood what it
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
takes to recycle this type of material
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
versus that type of material which is
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
why very clearly put into the study
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee taxing different uh
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
materials at different rates based on
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
the ease of proper disposal so you're
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely right not all recycle we talk
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
about recyclables if it's a toggle
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
switch they are not created equal some
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
materials are technically recyclable but
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the product you get at the end is
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
poor quality and it costs a lot of
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
money and effort and time to actually go
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
through that process so it's not really
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
worth it
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
so the point is there's no incentive
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
right now in a manufacturer to prefer
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
one to another because they don't they
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
don't really care once it's out of their
 
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.189 align:start position:0%
don't really care once it's out of their
store

00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
store
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
they're done with it
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
but the taxpayer is left with the burden
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
so yes we do understand the physical
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
science very very very well in terms of
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
what what actually the landfills are
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
having to deal with that's something
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
that a study committee like this
 
00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
that a study committee like this
could

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
survey and find out in the municipal
 
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.389 align:start position:0%
survey and find out in the municipal
landfills

00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
about what percentage of the waste you
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
deal with is this type versus that type
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
and what do you think it would cost
 
00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
and what do you think it would cost
follow-up

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up
 
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up
on

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
that being the case the technology of it
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
inclined to allow
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
if we could figure out how to merge this
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
into a study committee
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
over at ena
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
if they are so inclined would that be
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
okay that would be probably preferable
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
again we understand the technology
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's needed the problem is is that
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's up to the taxpayer to afford the
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
technology to do all these different
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
kinds of recycling right now if we end
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
up taxing manufacturers based on how
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
much they are putting a burden on
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers right now we tax them at that
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
rate then we can
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
we can get the funds to properly dispose
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
of everything that they create and i
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to be clear this is limited in my
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
study committee outline to single use
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
and and packaging right so it's not like
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
clothing or other you know furniture
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
stuff like that
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
but yes i i would be happy for this to
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
be merged so that we can get as much
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
information from the towns and from the
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
industries that deal with recycling as
 
00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:06.550 align:start position:0%
industries that deal with recycling as
possible

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:10.470 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
this is going to apply to manufacturers
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
how do you do you anticipate it also
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
applying to foreign manufacturers and if
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
so how would we actually tax them
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
again it's a study committee because i i
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
freely admit i don't have the economic
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
or mathematical or technical engineering
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
expertise to know all the details that
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
should go into such a complex idea but
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's a new idea and i think a study
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
committee could find out that kind of
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
information and land on whatever the
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative reed for presenting to us
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
today um in your in in your statements
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
earlier you talked about uh the cost of
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
goods what it takes to prepare the cost
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
of goods from a manufacturing point of
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
view and how that is passed down in the
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
price to the consumer
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
what is the difference in the consumer
 
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.669 align:start position:0%
what is the difference in the consumer
paying

00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
taxation on their end to take care of
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
this type of a service and that tax or
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
fee being
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
included in the price of the good that
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
is passed down to the to the consumer
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
well a tax is involuntary right like you
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
don't get to to choose whether or not
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
but you can choose whether or not to buy
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
it uh buy a product on a shelf based on
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
the cost so it's this doesn't the idea
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
the study is a study but if the idea
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
ever were to come to fruition
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't prevent any manufacturer
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
from creating a giant styrofoam
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
disgusting package or whatever but then
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
that cost would be reflected in the cost
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
of the item and that consumer can decide
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's worth it to them
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
which is the choice that they don't have
 
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.430 align:start position:0%
which is the choice that they don't have
now

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh mr follow thank you thank you mr
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
chairman uh i'm i i didn't quite
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
understand your i don't know if you
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
understood my question
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
the price if if this if this tax or fee
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
is imposed on the manufacturer they
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
would probably
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
wrap that into the cost of the good
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
right right
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is if that isn't
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
wrapped in to the cost of the good and
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
the good is too much then the consumer
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
would decide not to buy them correct and
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
that also provides an incentive to the
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to not do those exact kinds
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
of things right but yes it doesn't
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit that and so the consumer can
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
make the choice whether or not they want
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
to pay that extra bit of money for the
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
extra sized box that can't be recycled
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
yada yada whereas right now those things
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
are being bought
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
with no
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
kind of consideration for that price and
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
yet all of the taxpayers equally have to
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
fund the disposal of those items thank
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
for other questions
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm listening to you looking at my
 
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.710 align:start position:0%
so i'm listening to you looking at my
pen

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
pen
 
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
pen
so

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
so many manufacturers depend to me this
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
is a disposable pen
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
basically in your definition
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
when this pen is disposed of
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
because this disposable pen the pen
 
00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
because this disposable pen the pen
company

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
paper mate
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
have this tax imposed on them
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
but when i get when i buy the package of
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
pens it's in a paper carton
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you paper papermate isn't
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the paper carton they have
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
another manufacturer that does that and
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
i have uh buy like 10 pens at a time in
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
a package
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.590 align:start position:0%
so that
that

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
company would have to be taxed and and
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
in this case is just using a simple
 
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.789 align:start position:0%
in this case is just using a simple
example

00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.070 align:start position:0%
example
so

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
these these guys may be based in ohio
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
the package company may be based
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere else could be based overseas
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
i i know this is i know you want to
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
study but this just begs the question
 
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
study but this just begs the question
about

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
how practical this would be
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
because there's so many companies that
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
this would impact i mean
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
how do you keep track of that i mean how
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
how do you tax that i i don't know and
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
are we talking about
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's like three questions so far in
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay so first of all i personally don't
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
consider the pen uh single use but the
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
the point remains you can point to any
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
number of things that are single use
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
your example is valid um your question
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
is they the the manufacturers who
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
produce the end product that gets sold
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
to the consumer they use a number of
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
people and sources of of different
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
materials and whatever
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
my point is that they end up they're the
 
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.710 align:start position:0%
my point is that they end up they're the
end

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that produces the item that
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
goes to the consumer so they pay that
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
tax if they don't want to use if they
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay as much of a tax they
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
use another source or another type of
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
material so that will end you don't end
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
up directly taxing those manufacturers
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
of the original items because they're
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
not creating the consumer end product
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
but what you end up having is a market
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
incentive for them to go through other
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
manufactures or other sources of those
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
materials that are more easily disposed
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
disposed of or more cheaply disposed of
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
properly so that's that's my thought but
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
again as you pointed out this is
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
a study and so this is the kind of
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
question that could be discussed
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
but i don't see it as overly complicated
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
or difficult to you know to an
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
unworkable idea because you're not
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
taxing all of these manufacturers of all
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
these different materials that are
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
selling to manufacturers you're taxing
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
the end
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
product which then has an impact on the
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
so when
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
your vision of this because you talk
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
about tax and i heard the conversation
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a tax bill but it sounds
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
like it is
 
00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:47.909 align:start position:0%
like it is
uh

00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
i mean are we talking about business
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
taxes businessing up taxes is that what
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
you're envisioning i mean
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
technically this is a tax on
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so this would be a kind of
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
business tax very specific to what they
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
are creating so if they don't want to
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
pay that tax and yes that does get
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
passed on to the consumer as
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative nunes pointed out and i
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out the value of that but if
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
they want to pay that tax and they don't
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
want their product to be more expensive
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
then all they have to do is use
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
more recyclable materials
 
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.310 align:start position:0%
more recyclable materials
more

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
compostable materials biodegradable
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
materials less packaging in general
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
smaller packaging
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's all they have to do so i
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate that that's what they will do
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
rather than pay more tax
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
and in fact the way i had it listed is
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
that if they use those good types of
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
materials they wouldn't pay any tax now
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
having said that this is a tax reduction
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill because what this does is reduces
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
people's property tax that they're
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
currently paying to dispose of some
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh representative
 
00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.789 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh representative
reed

00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
reed
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
would this uh when we tax cigarettes we
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't tax
 
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
don't tax
altria

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
altria
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
we don't tax white
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh philip morris yeah we tax the uh
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
distributor in new hampshire
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
to the retailers
 
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.630 align:start position:0%
to the retailers
on

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that this we'd have
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
to do something like that sure
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
that the just like uh representative
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
abrami's example is well are we taxing
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
the original manufacturer of the
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
materials themselves you if you tax the
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
distributor then if in essence what
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're doing is putting that market
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
pressure on the manufacturers so it's
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
the same the same proc process in
 
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
the same the same proc process in
principle

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
principle
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
representative reed had you considered
 
00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:47.669 align:start position:0%
representative reed had you considered
how

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to determine
 
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.630 align:start position:0%
you're going to determine
the

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
amount of the tax and that's going to
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
vary from manufacturer to manufacturer
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
it i don't see it varying from
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturer manufacturer because this
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
is based on the actual disposal the cost
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
of properly disposing a particular
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
material per pound or per ounce or
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
whatever per ton
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change between manufacturer
 
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.669 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change between manufacturer
manufacturer

00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
the how that gets applied to the
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturer does because they make the
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
decision whether or not they create
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
something that's really difficult to
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
attack or to dispose of or they create
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
something that's like all biodegradable
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
and composable they they determine how
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
much they get taxed by that but the
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
actual rate would stay the same per the
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
for the material
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
so if the material was styrofoam would
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
be one one right and if it was cardboard
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
or another type of material would be
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
another rate that's the idea but again
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
this is a study committee and it's a new
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
idea so it needs study
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
but it's a powerful idea it has lots of
 
00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:58.549 align:start position:0%
but it's a powerful idea it has lots of
potential

00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
well i personally wouldn't be keeping
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
track of it
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
but what i'm not sure what you mean
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
about keeping track in terms of
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
the state i imagine department of
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
revenue which is right behind me would
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
have to um keep track of some of that
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
and then there would be
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
distribution to the towns right based on
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
the number of pounds so this does have
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
an administrative cost associated which
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
because of the situation
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
we can incorporate into that tax because
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
that administrative cost is part of the
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
have you come up with any suggestions on
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
who makes the decision on the
 
00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:37.269 align:start position:0%
who makes the decision on the
distribution

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
distribution
but

00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
so no because this is a study committee
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i trust that the committee knows
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
better than me any study committee who
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
has experience would know better than me
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
about how that should properly be
 
00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:48.390 align:start position:0%
about how that should properly be
administered

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
administered
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.470 align:start position:0%
my question
um

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
following up on what
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
had just said regarding the
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
administrative costs in which you said
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
dra behind you would
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
follow up how
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
i i just can't get beyond you're talking
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
about a fractional cost for styrofoam a
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
fractional cost for
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
the uh plastic that the
 
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.310 align:start position:0%
the uh plastic that the
pen

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
pen
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
comes wrapped in
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
a fractional cost for the uh the hanger
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
how about
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
how how can you figure that out without
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
increasing the cost of the pin from 99
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
cents to
 
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.070 align:start position:0%
cents to
99

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
99
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a bit of hyperbole if
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
you don't mind me saying 99 cents to 99
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cost a hundred dollars to
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
dispose of a single pin um but
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the question about administration is
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
um is a valid one but i presume that
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
this would be mostly done from by
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
reporting from the manufacturers
 
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.549 align:start position:0%
reporting from the manufacturers
themselves

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
we have sold x number of units
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
each unit contains x number of ounces of
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
styrofoam x number of ounces of
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
cardboard x number of ounces of whatever
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
so that is easy math multiplication they
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
sold this many units in new hampshire
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
times the number of pounds of each type
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
of material in that unit they can report
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
and it's simple math from there
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay so what you're saying
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's a tax after the fact
 
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.630 align:start position:0%
it's a tax after the fact
yes

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
sure i mean again this is a study
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
committee but if they find out a better
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
way to do that then that's fine but yes
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
you can so it wouldn't necessarily at
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
the end result then obviously any
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
increased cost
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
will be passed on to the consumer but
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
it's not a per unit tax necessarily
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
unless the powers that be decided that's
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
easier to do
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
but you can simply ask for the reporting
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
for the previous year and then send them
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
the dra is not
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
trained in chemistry
 
00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:10.470 align:start position:0%
trained in chemistry
on

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be important to get the
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
the people that are in their uh
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
their landfill sure i brought up the dra
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
strictly as the administrative or part
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
and important part of the administrative
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
section of this in terms of you know
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
putting out the the numbers uh
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the you know to the manufacturers and
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
how much they're going to owe in taxes
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
and then distributing that to the towns
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
but that's just the administrative
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
section how each of those rates is
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
determined would be up to experts i mean
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is very common for departments to
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
have communication perhaps they should
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
have better communication at times but
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's very common for that information to
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
pass back and forth and to your previous
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
point um just like we would be combining
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
two study committees from two different
 
00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.830 align:start position:0%
two study committees from two different
committees

00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
yes we would have communication between
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
the experts and the people doing the
 
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:10.950 align:start position:0%
the experts and the people doing the
administration

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
know before representative
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
romney asked you another question
 
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.950 align:start position:0%
romney asked you another question
is

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
why is it that you limit a study
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
four members of the house two from each
 
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.990 align:start position:0%
four members of the house two from each
party

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
and one member of the senate
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:29.430 align:start position:0%
um so
two

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
two reasons um i know in years past that
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
there were always two members of the
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
senate in order to have complete
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship i wanted equal numbers
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
from the house from both parties and i
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
can say that since i'm an independent um
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
and i uh the senate even though in years
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
past there was always two members per
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee they would always amend these
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
study committees to only have one member
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
of the senate because senators typically
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
feel very overworked so since we know
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's what they're going to do most
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
likely just have one have equal numbers
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
in the house and then you have an odd
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
number of committee members
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
okay the reason i ask that question is
 
00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:08.630 align:start position:0%
okay the reason i ask that question is
because

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you refer to the dra
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
and i would imagine
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
also the environmentals
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
why won't you have
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
them as
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
tired that's more of a study commission
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
from what i understand um rather than a
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'm happy very very happy to do that as
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
it stands now it's legislative and they
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
solicit the information from the dra
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
environmental services anybody else the
 
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
environmental services anybody else the
town

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
waste disposal entities they they can
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
solicit that but if this committee
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
prefers it to be a formal study
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
commission where you have all of those
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
members actively is part of the
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
commission and i'm happy for that too my
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that's harder to do
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
than a study committee
 
00:30:56.559 --> 00:30:58.789 align:start position:0%
than a study committee
representative

00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
one more
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
i'll make it a
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
given the national scope of what you're
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
trying to do here
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't it be better that you take
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
this idea to
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
to your
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
our federal congress people senator you
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
know house members and senators
 
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.070 align:start position:0%
know house members and senators
and

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
see if there's merit
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
for them to study it
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
versus new hampshire studying this would
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
you believe that i think that the
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
federal government is rather
 
00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:31.990 align:start position:0%
federal government is rather
dysfunctional

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
and would you believe further that i
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh i have seen many many movements
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
across the country that have started
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
with state laws and then ended up
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
becoming federal law because federal law
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
does that anybody else wish to testify
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
dave gervais
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
will you
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
i i normally don't get overly agitated
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
over study committee bills and so i had
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
not intended to testify on this
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
but i thought it was important to
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
because ultimately
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
you folks are going to be voting on this
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill and i thought at least one member
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
of the public ought to be participating
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the hearing to
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
just a couple of thoughts coming from
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
the from the previous testimony part of
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
what makes this
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
idea problematic
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
is it is solely focused on new hampshire
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and which leaves us with a
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
couple of questions
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
how would the manufacturer be taxed if
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're producing a single use product
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
but exporting it to other states or
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
other countries so it's not affecting
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
landfills in new
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire how would what we refer to as
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
foreign manufacturers meaning they're in
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
another state or another country but
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
importing goods into new hampshire be
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
taxed i don't think the state has the
 
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.350 align:start position:0%
taxed i don't think the state has the
ability

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
to tax them although i suppose
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
you could prohibit them from importing
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
product into the state if you chose to
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
another concern is why are we focusing
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
just on manufacturers
 
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.630 align:start position:0%
just on manufacturers
the

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
items in question go don't go directly
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
from the manufacturer to the consumer
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in general sell their
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
product in bulk to distributors
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
distributors sell that product to
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
retailers retailers sell it to consumers
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
why aren't we extracting some form of
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
tax along the whole
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
supply chain as it gets to consumers
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
including consumers because they're the
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
ones who are purchasing the product
 
00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:06.389 align:start position:0%
ones who are purchasing the product
um

00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
reps of all me made it an interesting
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
observation and and i'm happy to say uh
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative almi that i agree with
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
you completely
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
on this it's unfortunate this bill was
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh used tax in the title because it
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
ended up in this committee and and
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
with all due respect and i work with
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
this committee closely i don't think
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
you're the appropriate committee to be
 
00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:30.389 align:start position:0%
you're the appropriate committee to be
discussing

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
whether a study of of single-use waste
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
is is a good idea or a bad idea i
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
thought representative almi had a
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
terrific suggestion i don't know how one
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
goes about it but i'm sure there's a way
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
to suggest to legislators who are
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
working with environment and agriculture
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
on solid waste
 
00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.909 align:start position:0%
on solid waste
studies

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
studies
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the solid waste issue in the
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
state which we all recognize as a
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
significant issue to also consider
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
ideas such as this is a part of the
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
study that they already have in place so
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you for the opportunity
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
to testify i will fill out a pink card i
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to provide the committee
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
with some opposing thoughts as you look
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
toward executing the bill
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony mr gervais
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
dave du
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
prone to the idea of going after the
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
distributors of the products inside of
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire what
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
problems do you see with that
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
if any
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
aside from the general idea which you
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
may not like
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
for me it starts with the general idea
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
which i think is problematic but there's
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
all kinds of other problems that that
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
have already been um
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
identified by by your colleagues on the
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
committee which is how do you track this
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for the information
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for the enforcement
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
how is this
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
woven into an audit of the company
 
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.670 align:start position:0%
woven into an audit of the company
there's

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
there's
and

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and then again you know
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
if it's limited to manufacturers and
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
distributors should it also be uh
 
00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:18.150 align:start position:0%
distributors should it also be uh
include

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
retailers and should it also include
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
consumers the ones who are purchasing
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any any
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
study committees or commissions out
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
there that are looking at solid waste
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
right now well that's that's an
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
excellent question and and i have to
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
answer um
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
as you know because we've worked closely
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
together for a number of years that's
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
not an area within bia that i focus on i
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
have my colleagues that do
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure just in scanning the bills
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
i have seen things related to
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
solid waste and i wish i could be more
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
concrete but but it's just not my area
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
of expertise so i'm unsure about the
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that may be going on
 
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.230 align:start position:0%
legislation that may be going on
well

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
let me just uh
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
question for the chair thank you dave
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
question for the chair yes can we have
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
our researcher research that to see if
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
there are any active it sounds like
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
representative lang may have mr chairman
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
i just scan the uh ena
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
their their build list
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
while they have only ones they have one
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
study commission relative to
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
site planning for landfills but that's
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
it and then they also have a bottle bill
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
for a disposable type of product that is
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
all that's over there right now so i
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't see any bills that this would
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
cleanly attach to at all
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not talking about
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
miss chair i'm not talking about bills
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about existing commissions
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
or study committees that are out there
 
00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.430 align:start position:0%
or study committees that are out there
already

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
because we have plenty of them that are
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
turning away on different topics
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
again they just closed one that was they
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
repealed one last year that was in that
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
it finished its work and closed it okay
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
but okay that's just for discussion
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
duvet for taking my question
 
00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:20.710 align:start position:0%
duvet for taking my question
uh

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better for a new
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire study commission instead of
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
just disregarding
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
out of hand
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
i take it the knot of the head is yes
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize that was a question
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
for a study commission instead of
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
you're asking do i think we should do
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
the study committee rather than just
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
saying it's a bad
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
idea i didn't see a bad idea
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
well i guess
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't mean to put words into
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
your mouth
 
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.750 align:start position:0%
your mouth
um

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's probably an an unworkable
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
idea but
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.630 align:start position:0%
you're right
it

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
maybe deserves a closer look but i'm
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
suggesting rather than
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
having it as a study committee that is
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
focused so narrowly on establishing
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
attacks on single-use products that it
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
be woven into a broader
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
review of issues relating to landfills
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the state and to representative
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
abrami's question
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
i suggest because there's a whole
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
department within environmental services
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
that deals with this issue it would be
 
00:39:49.359 --> 00:39:50.390 align:start position:0%
that deals with this issue it would be
worth

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
talking to the commissioner
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
saying we've had this issue identified
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
in legislation
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
what do you think might be the best
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
approach to
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
to either getting an answer to this or
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
having it become a part of a larger
 
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
having it become a part of a larger
review

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.790 align:start position:0%
review
representative

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
well this was just
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
like a previous one a comment today i
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
think it was yesterday the ena
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
did an entire day of landfill work
 
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.069 align:start position:0%
did an entire day of landfill work
and

00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the ena committee
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
seem to be quite interested in
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
doing something about our landfill
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
problem which is becoming quite critical
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
that they would you ought to talk to the
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
chair of ena as well
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%

nobody else
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
testifying far against the bill and
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
closing the public hearing on house bill
 
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.069 align:start position:0%
closing the public hearing on house bill

1338.
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
the message here
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:32.470 align:start position:0%
mr chair
yes

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.270 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.150 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
question came up before about people who
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
are watching this
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
remotely and there's a mechanism for
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
their signing
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes their support i don't support and we
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
were going to come back to that i don't
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
know how we're going to get back to it
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
because i think we learned that it's not
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
until the end of the day that you know
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
how many people have signed up
 
00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.150 align:start position:0%
how many people have signed up
so

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
so
yes

00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
there was a email that came out
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
describing a procedure for testifying
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
for or against
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
and it refers you to the general court
 
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.710 align:start position:0%
and it refers you to the general court
website

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
it would tell you what length
 
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.510 align:start position:0%
it would tell you what length
to

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
click on and then you can
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
sign in and support or not
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe when we have our work
 
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.750 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe when we have our work
sessions

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
we could have a report with respect to
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
maybe when we have the work sessions on
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
each bill which may lead to executive
 
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.950 align:start position:0%
each bill which may lead to executive
sessions

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
a piece of
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
the introduction of each bill would be
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
and these are the numbers
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
for that bill
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
where we're seeing news reports about
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
bills and they often have numbers of
 
00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:01.270 align:start position:0%
bills and they often have numbers of
people

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
who signed in pro and con it's part of
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
the picture so we need to be sure we
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.430 align:start position:0%
have that
picture

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
picture
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
right we're having a work session on all
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
of our bills
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%

uh right guys
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%

you all can see that the public can see
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
that and it totals the support and
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
opposition so i just pulled up 1338
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
and online we have eight in support and
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
two opposed

so that's something everyone can access
 
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.790 align:start position:0%
so that's something everyone can access
now

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
and then when we do the work session
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
we'll update the information
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.710 align:start position:0%
 
anything

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
you'd be satisfied with just the number
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
of yes four and number against is that
 
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.710 align:start position:0%
of yes four and number against is that
correct

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
i for the record i am representative
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%

convert this into a study committee
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
um but the idea and the tent is
 
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.190 align:start position:0%
um but the idea and the tent is
really

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.069 align:start position:0%
really
well

00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
basically allow
 
00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.950 align:start position:0%
basically allow
renters

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
renters
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
to come together
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
and own
 
00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:17.430 align:start position:0%
and own
their

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
building and create equity
 
00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:21.030 align:start position:0%
building and create equity
in

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
what we are seeing is a climate where
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
people cannot afford to to own homes and
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
even if they wanted to there's just a
 
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.109 align:start position:0%
even if they wanted to there's just a
shortage

00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
so it was is not being funded correctly
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
in the current bill
 
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.750 align:start position:0%
in the current bill
and

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
they are adopting this in other states
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
but to make it perfectly fit with new
 
00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:46.230 align:start position:0%
but to make it perfectly fit with new
hampshire's

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
departments and to fund it properly we
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
would need to study this a little bit
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
further and since it is a
 
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.069 align:start position:0%
further and since it is a
really

00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
good idea i think there's merit in
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
studying this
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
and that's all i ask from the committee
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
today and i am completely open and
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
amenable to any amendments that you
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:10.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.839 --> 00:48:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
2022-0178

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
 
h

00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:22.230 align:start position:0%
h
yes

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
and to replace the bill as is yes
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
and so it will be a study committee yes
 
00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
and so it will be a study committee yes
please

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.829 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
romney thank you
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you for your testimony
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
can you just
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
you say it sounds like you you're saying
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
that other states have done something in
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
this arena
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh can you define exactly what a limited
 
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.589 align:start position:0%
uh can you define exactly what a limited
equity

00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
equity
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
cooperative is
 
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.270 align:start position:0%
cooperative is
basically

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
a land or a
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
an area such as an apartment building
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
be purchased at rate value
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
by grants or other programs and then
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
sold back to the renters
 
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.589 align:start position:0%
sold back to the renters
at

00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
market value or a lower rate that they
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
can afford
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
so that they can all
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
basically own the building together be
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the taxes
 
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.309 align:start position:0%
responsible for the taxes
and

00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
basically it's it's like a version of
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
small home ownership but
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to understand so
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
let's say there's an apartment building
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
with 20 units
 
00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:39.910 align:start position:0%
with 20 units
and

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
they managed to say yeah all the renters
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
say yeah we wish we could own this
 
00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:45.270 align:start position:0%
say yeah we wish we could own this
building

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then we can
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
charge itself well they have to pay for
 
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.870 align:start position:0%
charge itself well they have to pay for
that

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
but what you're saying is
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
they may or may not be able to finance
 
00:49:55.119 --> 00:49:56.630 align:start position:0%
they may or may not be able to finance
that

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
so they may be looking for other means
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
other grants or whatever to help them do
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
this so i i'm just is that am i
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
interpreting this correctly yes and
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
there are uh programs available for this
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
that we have not tapped into which is
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
why i think it's necessary to start
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
studying this and see
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
what we can accomplish and
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
give to our citizens at you know another
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%

thank you for your question as i um
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to it because it was
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
kind of it i feel like it
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
it dissolved a little bit no offense but
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying did i work with
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
the loan housing
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
have you do you know what the new
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire community loan fund is yes in
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
fact they helped me write this amendment
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay and there isn't a program which is
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
why they've expressed interest in this
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
and that this bill isn't ready for prime
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
time and out of respect for all the
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
stakeholders this is why i'm proposing
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment change
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you do you suppose you could have
 
00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.150 align:start position:0%
thank you do you suppose you could have
them

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
talk to us
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
um we have an awful lot of experience in
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
this area i i suppose i can have um some
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the people that work over there yes
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
um and maybe they're even in the
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
audience today um what we're
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
experiencing though is a really low rate
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
of people testifying at the state house
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
as you've seen
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i i can't
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
control or force any of the people
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
that have been involved in any of the
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
legislation process this year to come
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
and testify unfortunately but
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
i can give you their information and
 
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.670 align:start position:0%
i can give you their information and
i

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they're always willing to have
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative for being here today um
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
when you talk about uh the initial
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
funding of the purchase of the building
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
coming from a grant program how's that
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
grant funded in your eyes
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
from donors or federal funding
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
we have to take a look at what other
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
states are doing and how they're getting
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
their money and that's exactly what this
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee should do
 
00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.829 align:start position:0%
committee should do
thank

00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
you representation
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
i i think at one point during your
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
testimony you said that it could be
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
purchased potentially for a little less
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
than market value
 
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.710 align:start position:0%
than market value
but

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
why would an owner sell it for less than
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
market value or did you mean the fact
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
that those grants would help it
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
be purchased more easily you're correct
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
um that the
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
the grants would purchase
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
at market value or however this
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
trust would be set up
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
they would be giving the seller market
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
rate value so the seller wouldn't be
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
losing any sort of money on this
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
and then what this is designed to do is
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
then resell it to a group of people that
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
maybe can't afford market rate value
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.150 align:start position:0%
further questions
alan

00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
alan
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you talk to the new
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing finance authority
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is at this point the chief source
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire-based housing funding
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
i may have there have been a lot of
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
meetings on this and a lot of
 
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.150 align:start position:0%
meetings on this and a lot of
stakeholders

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
and um we have been meeting actually for
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
over a month going back and forth on
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
what would be the best course of action
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't ready for prime time and we had
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
discussed even pulling the bill but
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
because this is such an important idea
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
and has so much value to people in our
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
communities that
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's not enough supply to meet the
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
demand i think it would behoove us and
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
it would be a disservice if we just
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
didn't even look at all options
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:54:59.359 --> 00:55:00.390 align:start position:0%
okay um
you

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
provided us with this amendment this
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
amendment completely changes it to a
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
study and it's very specific
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
what you want to study
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
how how it's going to be financed or any
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
it says the benefit of utilizing limited
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
equity cooperatives to stabilize rents
 
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.870 align:start position:0%
equity cooperatives to stabilize rents
etc

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
to use
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
the use in other states of limited
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
equity cooperatives to purchase
 
00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
equity cooperatives to purchase
and

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations for future legislation
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
to facilitate the formation of limited
 
00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.589 align:start position:0%
to facilitate the formation of limited
equity

00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
equity
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
so it's like starting
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
new right
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
and and yes and with all due respect mr
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
bringing those studies and those
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to the table for future
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislation i would hope that they would
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
give you the correct information on how
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
it should be studied to put in future
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislation okay
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
i think what would really
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
help i know would help me
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
consider this study proposal
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
a communication it could be in writing
 
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.870 align:start position:0%
a communication it could be in writing
from

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
a community loan
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
provides information about limited
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
equity cooperatives and how
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know in a general way because of
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
studies of study study is supposed to
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
dig into this
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
this is an idea worth exploring so right
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
now we just have a few words and your
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
brief description
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
but we don't really have enough
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
i think to
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
without that kind of
 
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.829 align:start position:0%
without that kind of
background

00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much and i again as
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
stated at the beginning of my testimony
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm open to amending this to include
 
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.470 align:start position:0%
i'm open to amending this to include
um

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:21.349 align:start position:0%
um
key

00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders again i i don't want to
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
overuse that word but
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
the housing authority the finance
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
they can be a part of this committee and
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
i can go ahead to ols and redraft this
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
if we were going to go forward with this
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
we need something from the housing
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
finance authority and from the community
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
loan fund about how they think
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
this will be helpful
 
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.030 align:start position:0%
this will be helpful
and

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
you either depend on us to try to make
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
of course um what is my yeah what how
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
long are you going to give me
 
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.589 align:start position:0%
long are you going to give me
and

00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
am i understanding correctly that
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
you possibly don't trust the fact that i
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
got help writing this entire thing from
 
00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.150 align:start position:0%
got help writing this entire thing from
them

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
well we don't know
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
we only have you here because you say
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
they won't come but they could have sent
 
00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.190 align:start position:0%
they won't come but they could have sent
something

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine
 
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine
and

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
for the matter of time if we all agree
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
we want to do something we're going to
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
exact next week but if we don't all
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
agree we're we've got until the 17th i
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
think it is of february
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay so can i un let me for
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
clarification you do agree that this is
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
a good idea but you don't want to move
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
forward until you get actual
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
confirmation from the people that helped
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're supposed to opine
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
but personally
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
i need more information
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
if not we have
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
first one is brandon
 
00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:25.510 align:start position:0%
first one is brandon
larry

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
larry
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
from the rights and democracy i believe
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
brandon lemay i am from manchester new
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i am representing rights
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
and democracy
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
we are a grassroots group of members who
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
wish to engage both electorally
 
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
and on the policy side of things
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
so i also represent our manchester
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
housing work group called the manchester
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
housing alliance
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
and they were a big push behind
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative knight for sponsoring
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
this bill uh so i'd also like to thank
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative knight for um for
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
obliging us before you go any further
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
are you testifying for on the amendment
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
or the bill itself uh in the uh for the
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
amendment sorry thank you for asking
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.390 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
um

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah um we are actually looking to
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
start our own limited equity co-op um
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
and we got the idea for this bill when
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
we were talking with zachary palmer of
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
who are associated with the community
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
loan fund
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to field any other
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
questions you have about limited equity
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
co-ops and land trusts
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
specifically the reason why we want to
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
just turn this into a study bill is
 
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.190 align:start position:0%
just turn this into a study bill is
originally

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of the language was copied from
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
what vermont was doing
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
but after a lot of discussion with both
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
l-chip and other stakeholders we
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
realized that you know new hampshire
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's its own state and what works in
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
vermont isn't going to work in new
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire so a big reason why we want to
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
have this be a study is because we want
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
to see how we can best
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
synchronize this into the way our state
 
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.789 align:start position:0%
synchronize this into the way our state
works

01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah um
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
one thing i wanted to emphasize is
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
nationwide we have only about 200 000
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh residential units that are actually
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
ada compliant
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
and we see a huge need for those with
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities to have accessible housing
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
so big part of what we would be doing is
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
serving a lot of underserved uh folks
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to housing
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
um also we want to serve those who are
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
making you know anywhere from like you
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
know zero percent to even like fifty
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
percent of like the uh
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
median income so
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
um i would be more than happy to take
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have um and also
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
be really happy to oblige to get
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
community loan fund uh involved here
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative romney thank you mr thank
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like you're a group
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit i would imagine yep
 
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.309 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit i would imagine yep
um

01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
sounds like your group is moving forward
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
without legislation
 
01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.349 align:start position:0%
without legislation
yeah

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:04.150 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
do we really need legislation for this i
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
mean forget about the study part of it
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
you know we can study this
 
01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:11.829 align:start position:0%
you know we can study this
but

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
why would we need legislation to make it
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
easier for you to do what you're going
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
to do or
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so when i was talking to financiers
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
for this um
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
some of which are uh not-for-profit uh
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
sources like the community loan fund but
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
also if we wanted to try to get any sort
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
of financing from like a private equity
 
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.309 align:start position:0%
of financing from like a private equity
firm

01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
firm
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
they would like to see some sort of
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation uh bankers like to
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
be a hundred percent sure uh when they
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
give money
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh so uh there's no there's nothing
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
saying that we can't do it but there's
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
also nothing saying that we can like
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly do it so uh they would like
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
to see some legislation in place
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification thank
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
you yeah further questions
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative elmy
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
i work with homeowners associations
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
condominiums and
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
the few cooperatives that are are out
 
01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.430 align:start position:0%
the few cooperatives that are are out
there

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.470 align:start position:0%
there
uh

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
in my other hat
 
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.829 align:start position:0%
in my other hat
and

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
there there is a cooperative law which
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
is very old now but which uh
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
includes all businesses but also
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
includes housing
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh it isn't terribly specific on housing
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you've looked through
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
that to see
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
where you think changes ought to be made
 
01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.870 align:start position:0%
where you think changes ought to be made
to

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
allow this specific type of i don't know
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
what you mean actually about
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
the difference between limited equity
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
cooperative and a
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
a regular housing cooperative
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yeah um and to be honest um i'm
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
actually not entirely 100 sure of the
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
difference uh either i know that
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
specifically um there are just uh
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
different ways different grants that you
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
can get if you're a limited equity co-op
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
this is exactly why i think we need to
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
study bill is so many states have done
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
so many different things
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
and we need to really assess what has
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
been done and what would really make
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
sense here
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
so actually appreciate you mentioning
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
that but yeah as you said i couldn't
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
find we couldn't find anything that was
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
like specifically you know enabling this
 
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:22.950 align:start position:0%
like specifically you know enabling this
or

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
disallowing it
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony all right
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
sheila

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
representing the
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
nature conservatory

and
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
you're talking
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
about the bill or the amendment the
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
original bill um i have not had a chance
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
to see the amendment language
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
as we can all agree l-chip is an
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
extremely popular program having not
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment language i'm not
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking to the amendment
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to come and urge the
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
committee to itl the original bill 1407
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions as i said i
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the amendment language
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
housing affordability
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
is a huge issue as a young person living
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i know that the nature
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
conservancy is not a housing
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
organization and so we thank the
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors for introducing
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
an amendment that does not include the
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
l-chip program because we don't see the
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
l-trip program as a savings account that
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
we can withdraw from to put a band-aid
 
01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:58.870 align:start position:0%
we can withdraw from to put a band-aid
over

01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
other issues that frankly are not in the
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
statute so i will be respectful of the
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
committee's time leave it at that and i
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to itl the original
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill thank you happy to answer any
 
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.789 align:start position:0%
bill thank you happy to answer any
questions

01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative sean mr chairman uh
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
so you're just talking about the l-chip
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
savings account the ability to
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
get into it to use for
 
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
get into it to use for
this

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
equity housing
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
correct and i i'm speaking to it
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition of that because the
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
original bill text was seeking to expand
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
the scope of the l-chip program to fund
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and while affordable
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
housing is a critically important issue
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
in the state we don't feel that l-chip
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
would be that uh source of funding
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
especially because the number of
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
applicants for l-chip keeps increasing
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
every year and there are not enough
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
funds in the l-chip program to actually
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
meet the demand right now so essentially
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
the original bill pulling from l-chip to
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
fund affordable housing would be a tiny
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
tiny band-aid on what we can all agree
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
is a massive issue
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative almighty
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your
 
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.069 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your
testimony

01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah i i can say i'm looking at
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
at line five of the original bill it
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
says because currently your mission is
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
natural cultural and historic resources
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
and then they tacked on promotion of
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for residents
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
correct that's way astray i guess is it
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
would you it's your view that this is
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
way astray of the original purpose of
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
l-chip uh yes in my humble opinion it is
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to agree that
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
aside from the financial part of this it
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
would cost
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
l-chip an enormous amount of time effort
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
and new personnel to deal with an issue
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
that they do not deal with at all
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
which is very complicated
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative and i just
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
want to be transparent with the
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee when we saw the bill released
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
we were very concerned and so we did
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
reach out to the bill sponsors we have
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
been communicating with them they did
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
indicate that l-chip is not the best way
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
to go about this and so while we
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate them looking for a solution
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
and looking to a program like l-chip
 
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.349 align:start position:0%
and looking to a program like l-chip
which

01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
is incredibly effective and incredibly
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
popular it really should be a template
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
for them not the savings account that
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative malloy
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
this may be a question of the committee
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
or the chair what is the amount in the
 
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.709 align:start position:0%
or the chair what is the amount in the
l-chip

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
l-chip
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
what's the preparation now for that does
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
anybody recall
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
did you say that again what is the l
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
chip uh balance what is the
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
appropriation for l-chip right now
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%

01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%

what i'm hoping is that if
 
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.110 align:start position:0%
what i'm hoping is that if
both

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
parties after they have their caucuses
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%

up literally out of a garage with
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
with next to nothing they had only a few
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
when they started up and started making
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%

01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
which was just a computer kit
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%

and
uh

01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know rock bands that that
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
literally the only assets they have is
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
their is their musical gear
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
um i was part of a uh for a while a game
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
development uh startup company and those
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
companies are starting with uh virtually
 
01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.109 align:start position:0%

no

01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
revenue to speak of and no initial
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
assets to speak of so
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
money's tight
 
01:35:43.679 --> 01:35:44.709 align:start position:0%
money's tight
the

01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
the the three things that the bill is
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
proposing to do is give you that
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
five-year exemption from having to pay
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
the annual filing fee
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
it exempts you for five years from the
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax and it allows
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
you to defer for five years the business
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if legislative services
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
stuck to that
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
meticulously this went through about
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
four different redrafts
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
to try to get the the exact language
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
that i was trying to get and uh
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think they even suggested that i might
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to go through another redraft or a
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee amendment in the end but um
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
that that was the intent the intent was
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
where you have very very small
 
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.350 align:start position:0%
where you have very very small
businesses

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.629 align:start position:0%
businesses
that

01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
that don't have money that can't afford
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
to sit down with an attorney
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
where you have
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
several different entrepreneurs
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
from around new england
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
i thought that it would be a good idea
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
if one of them could say
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
hey i live in new hampshire and we have
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
this easy llc startup
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
approach where you don't have to pay any
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
filing fees at all initially and you can
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
defer whatever your not only your taxes
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
but you can defer your tax filings for
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
up to five years
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
so since most of these
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
really small startups shoestring
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
startups uh
 
01:37:02.239 --> 01:37:05.350 align:start position:0%
startups uh
never

01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
either never turn a profit or never make
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
enough money to justify
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
turning into a full-size business i felt
 
01:37:11.679 --> 01:37:12.550 align:start position:0%
turning into a full-size business i felt
that

01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.590 align:start position:0%
that
that

01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
a pretty good alternative
 
01:37:18.159 --> 01:37:18.950 align:start position:0%
a pretty good alternative
for

01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
for companies that maybe only have a
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
small percentage chance of of ever
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
making it big
 
01:37:24.639 --> 01:37:25.910 align:start position:0%
making it big
um

01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
i've talked with some members of the
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee and i've talked with people
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
downstairs in the uh in the state house
 
01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:32.790 align:start position:0%
downstairs in the uh in the state house
and

01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
budgeting office and
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
dra and whatnot and
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
they've liked the general concept
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
of having some kind of tax deferment or
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
tax exemption for new startups of course
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
new york state has the most famous
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
startup plan which is that they get a
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
10-year complete tax exemption but they
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
have lots and lots of restrictions on
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
that and they have to stay
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
in new york state over the long run but
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is looking at the fact that
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
that in new england you can have several
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs and they can be in
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
different states but we want to have as
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
many of those new startups start up in
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as possible so that they
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
then gradually grow expand create jobs
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
and and maybe convert to a different llc
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
or s or c corporation
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
so that was the that was the intent of
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
the bill is just to
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh recognize that those types of
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
startups aren't aren't necessarily going
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
to be generating any revenue for a while
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
um certainly won't be generating very
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
big profits for a while but we want to
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
kind of maximize the number of new
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
startups that are attempted here in new
 
01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:35.189 align:start position:0%
startups that are attempted here in new
hampshire

01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony would
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
you take questions
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
sure thing
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you max um
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
so you have section three in the bill
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
too establishing a study committee
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
can you explain what the purpose of that
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
is please uh that was added in by
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh legislative services and they didn't
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
give me a clear explanation for why they
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a study committee added
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
into it but that was their decision okay
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:39:06.719 --> 01:39:08.310 align:start position:0%
further questions
representative

01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
dra would have no cognizance of
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
these startups
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
for five years is that the way it would
 
01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.229 align:start position:0%
for five years is that the way it would
operate

01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
no they would file with the secretary of
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
state corporate division and they would
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
they would actually have a corporate
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
filing but they wouldn't
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh in most cases they wouldn't uh do the
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
100 a year annual
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
filing and and part of the reason for
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
that there are lots and lots of garage
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
band startups there are lots of small
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
businesses that
 
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
never amount to anything
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so it did it didn't make sense
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
from my viewpoint to
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
kind of flood the secretary of state's
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
office and the um
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
the dra with with filings for companies
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
that aren't yet profitable and aren't
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
likely to be
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
profitable soon
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
mr chairman follow-up follow-up i'm a
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
little confused i never knew we had a
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
filing fee
 
01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.910 align:start position:0%
filing fee
in

01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.870 align:start position:0%
in
dra

01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
and the person behind you is shaking his
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
head are you sure you're not talking
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
about the one in
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
in the department of state
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
they when i talked to the secretary of
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
state's office actually when i talked to
 
01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:28.470 align:start position:0%
state's office actually when i talked to
the

01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
the corporate division they said that
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
there's a 100 a year filing fee
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
even if you don't make any money you
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
still have to file that fee every single
 
01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.430 align:start position:0%
still have to file that fee every single
year

01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's in the secretary of state's office
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
it's not in dra
 
01:40:46.159 --> 01:40:47.109 align:start position:0%
it's not in dra
right

01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
um so you would be what you really want
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
to do is to exempt
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
the filing fee in the corporate
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.189 align:start position:0%
and then
in

01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
dra exempt
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
bet for five years and defer the bpt to
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
the fifth or sixth year correct
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
and do you
 
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.790 align:start position:0%
and do you
know

01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
about on
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
particularly restaurants
 
01:41:14.719 --> 01:41:15.910 align:start position:0%
particularly restaurants
that

01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
they very frequently start as llc's
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
and very frequently die within the first
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
five years and restart immediately
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
thereafter as a different restaurant
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd see a lot i actually see a lot
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
of turnover in seabrook we've had
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
in fact there are certain
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
locations that look good but that every
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
single business that opens up at certain
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
locations ends up closing down usually
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
within three or four or five years
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
so if those are locations that are never
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
going to generate a profit they're not
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop someone from trying
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is simple
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
if if this is a
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
an exemption of the fee but a deferral
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the tax
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
what would then happen to the llc or the
 
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
startup that
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
fails after three years are they going
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
to be forgiven for the
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
the taxes that would have accrued over
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
those three years or
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
well if they fail they're not there
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's no business profits tax
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
to pay if they're if their net earnings
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
over five years is negative
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
then there's no tax to be there's no tax
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
liability to be paid to the state in
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
that case anyway
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
but if they did
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
have any if they started off strong and
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
then failed within that five-year period
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
and they didn't pay the bet would they
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
then be responsible for it they would
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
never be responsible for the first five
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
years of bet that's the exemption that's
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
um and then the bpt is what is what gets
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
deferred deferred
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
i talked to legislative services and i i
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
tried to get them to include a provision
 
01:42:57.119 --> 01:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
tried to get them to include a provision
saying

01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
that that business in order to maintain
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
this has to maintain
 
01:43:02.239 --> 01:43:03.590 align:start position:0%
this has to maintain
um

01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.030 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient liquidity sufficient sellable
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
assets to cover whatever their their
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
outstanding tax liability might be great
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
representatives did you have your hand
 
01:43:20.159 --> 01:43:21.109 align:start position:0%
representatives did you have your hand
up

01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
good morning i think
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning
 
01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.550 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning
um

01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not uh maybe i'm missing this but um
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill provides for a tax
 
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.950 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill provides for a tax
deferral

01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
deferral
 
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
for any tax for a period of five years
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's that's how it's stated
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
shall be granted the tax deferral for a
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
period of five years
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
to be qualified for that
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
it has to be a qualified llc
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
with a payroll of no more than a hundred
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year
 
01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.390 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year
so

01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
if they get the deferral
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to it because they've
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
they get a five-year exemption but then
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
what if their payroll goes up
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
in the third year
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
are they still quite are they still
 
01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.390 align:start position:0%
are they still quite are they still
eligible

01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh if something happens in the third
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
year where they need more full-time
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
employees and they go over the one
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar limit then they
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
would no longer at that point continue
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
to be a qualified llc so they'd have the
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
deferment for the first three years but
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
they could they wouldn't get it for the
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
full five years at the at that three
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
year point where they need to exceed
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
that they're no longer one of these
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
little tiny
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
startups say now okay so that's the
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i understand how
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
much value this is going to add because
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
if i'm if i'm not mistaken the current
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
bet tax doesn't kick in until 150 k
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
so you don't even have to worry about
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
this 100 k limit it's not going to kick
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
in to 150 and then as far as the bpt
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
that was increased i believe it's
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 92 k until you
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
have at least 92 000 in profits or
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
thereabouts there's no bpt tax
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
so isn't that isn't the current law
 
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.310 align:start position:0%
so isn't that isn't the current law
enough

01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.189 align:start position:0%
enough
to

01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
be able to get somebody going without
 
01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
having paying taxes well the payroll and
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
revenue are two different things i'm
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
assuming this is this is a business that
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
can have
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
two or three or four entrepreneurs
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh starting in there and i assume that
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to be working full-time i
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know obviously envisioned i'm not
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
you know in seabrook so we have a lot of
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
landscaping roofers plow businesses
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
and they're usually family businesses so
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily have a large
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
payroll but if they if they had you know
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
two plow trucks if they had two work
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
trucks i could i could foresee them
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
having you know certainly well over a
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in revenue but
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to have the whole family
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
working it
 
01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.030 align:start position:0%
working it
um

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
so it's possible to not have any payroll
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
at all and just have a family-owned
 
01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:25.669 align:start position:0%
at all and just have a family-owned
business

01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's going for several years and they
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
could have
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
over five years they could potentially
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
have close to a million dollars in total
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know they could have two hundred
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year in
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
in total revenue coming in
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh just be working the business
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
themselves or an automotive shop or a
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
collision shop or
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
or any type of business like that just
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
when they're first getting started and
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
they have it they haven't hired more
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
than maybe one or two employees
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
um they're they're pretty small they
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
might have relatively high revenue
 
01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:58.070 align:start position:0%
might have relatively high revenue
um

01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
but if if there is in fact some type of
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
business profits that that just that
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
business profits would be deferred and
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
the bet would be exempt
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
so under under current law that
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
particular bit type of business right
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
now might have some bet
 
01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.350 align:start position:0%
now might have some bet
liability

01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.719 --> 01:47:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
for a lot of brand new startups um where
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're not familiar with the business
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax and especially people who
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
have just moved here
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
or if they have
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
three or four people and only one of
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
them lives in new hampshire and none of
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
them is an expert on the bet the b-e-t
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
can be kind of confusing and it can
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
discourage people from setting up a
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
business here
 
01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:42.790 align:start position:0%
business here
follow-up

01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up so on the bpt when you say
 
01:47:45.119 --> 01:47:46.390 align:start position:0%
follow-up so on the bpt when you say
deferred

01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
deferred
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
um so if if
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
it gets added to so after five years
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't it suddenly
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
become something that it's that in
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
itself could hurt them because now they
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
suddenly have to pay this chunk of
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
money after five years
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it is it that's true but it is
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
better being able being able to defer a
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
tax especially when
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
the state tax
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
is deductible on your federal tax as a
 
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.550 align:start position:0%
is deductible on your federal tax as a
cost

01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
defer you know you don't have to take
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
the full five year deferment you could
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
take a three or four year deferment
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
whatever ends up being most advantageous
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
on your on your your federal tax returns
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
so if you can take a larger
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
cost say in your fourth year you may be
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
able to save
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of money on your your
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
federal tax return
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
the hundred thousand dollars
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
on payroll
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
what does that include
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
does that include uh the benefits of the
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
social security and all that
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
um that was just meant to in sorry that
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
was just meant to include
 
01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.709 align:start position:0%
was just meant to include
um

01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:56.719 --> 01:48:58.629 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
actual payroll the actual wages
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh in the same way that we uh
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
account for it when you're figuring out
 
01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.390 align:start position:0%
account for it when you're figuring out
uh

01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
um social security wages or unemployment
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
wages that calculation on your
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
should have been spelled out as wages
 
01:49:13.599 --> 01:49:14.390 align:start position:0%
should have been spelled out as wages
then

01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:15.350 align:start position:0%
then
okay

01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.950 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:19.109 align:start position:0%
okay
it

01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
when you have two people
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's hard to
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
keep a payroll
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
under a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
if if they're going to be
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
why did you pick a hundred thousand i
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
initially i was gonna say none i was
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
gonna say zero if you wanted to have you
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
know an independent contractor or
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
contract some of the work out
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and i i i kind of thought this
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
through i'm trying to say this is for
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
really small companies that don't even
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
have any employees but someone might
 
01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.589 align:start position:0%
have any employees but someone might
hire

01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
hire
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
get at some point during the year they
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
have to hire a secretary they have to
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
hire a truck driver to make deliveries
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
or do do some type of work and i said
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
well there's got to be a you know a cap
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
you can't just have it be
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know a billion dollar fab lab or
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
something like that i didn't want to
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
have big business
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
um taking advantage of this
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
and you know not paying any
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
tax at all this is meant for like for
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
really really small home-based
 
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:26.950 align:start position:0%
really really small home-based
businesses

01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
and businesses that just have one small
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
simple shop it's it's actually not meant
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
for them to have employees at all but if
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
they were gonna hire someone temporary
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
or seasonal or have two people working
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
that didn't want them to just suddenly
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
automatically lose this tax deferment
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
just on that
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative brown you have a question
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank mr chair uh thank uh thanks for
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
the question again
 
01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:54.550 align:start position:0%
the question again
so

01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
i'm more concerned about the mechanics
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
of how this would work
 
01:50:58.159 --> 01:50:59.350 align:start position:0%
of how this would work
uh

01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
i would assume that they have to file
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
each year a return
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
for the dra to keep track of
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
of any profits that they do make no
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
let's say the five year period
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
but you know but that's number one uh
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
so you would agree that they'd have to
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
file each year correct
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
what dras mentioned in the in their
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh analysis is that it would be
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient to take whatever your federal
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
tax filing is and send them a copy of
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
that okay that would be fine
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then the funny thing in our state is
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know the interplay between the bet
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
and the bpt
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not going to try to
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
articulate how whether there's an impact
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
i think we need to hear from the dra how
 
01:51:40.239 --> 01:51:40.950 align:start position:0%
i think we need to hear from the dra how
that

01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
all plays out
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
or even whether it's advantageous
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh to the filer and
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
to to to have this to to use this
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
because of the interaction of bpt and
 
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.070 align:start position:0%
because of the interaction of bpt and
bet

01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
bet
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
well one offset's the other
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
but i guess you're already offsetting
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
that you have to pay the bet so i guess
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's a benefit well
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
my thing was most most
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
states don't have a business enterprise
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
tax there are some unusual taxes that
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
they have in other states and there are
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
a few things that we don't have in new
 
01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:17.270 align:start position:0%
a few things that we don't have in new
hampshire

01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
but sometimes when you have
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
people looking at putting together
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
startup and they're thinking you know
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or new hampshire or
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
they're thinking maine or new hampshire
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
if they're looking at the possibility of
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
being hit with a tax liability that they
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
don't understand that's confusing and
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have somebody they don't have
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
a legislator there to explain it um
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll say i don't even
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
understand what this is so we don't know
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
what the worst case scenario is so they
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
end up just they'll they would file in
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
another state
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know better the devil you know than
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
the one that you don't
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
um and i've had to explain the bet even
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
to people who
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
how it how it uh
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
whatever business enterprise tax you pay
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
is credited towards your business
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
profits tax and i've had to explain that
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
to people even who've lived here their
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
whole lives and it can be a little bit
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
confusing um if you're not used to it
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%

familiar with forming new business
entities

01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
with that context i just wanted to let
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know i have a few concerns with your
 
01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.830 align:start position:0%
you know i have a few concerns with your
bill

01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
primarily because
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
of some of the language that's included
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
which i think may have been or may lead
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
to unintended consequences
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
to begin with i i would just like to ask
 
01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.070 align:start position:0%
to begin with i i would just like to ask
um

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.350 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.709 align:start position:0%
um
why

01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
have you authored the bill that only
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
llcs and not other business entities
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
here in the state
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's just it was just a draft idea
 
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.550 align:start position:0%
uh it's just it was just a draft idea
as

01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
we had conversations last year about
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
with other members of the committee and
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
it was just to propose something to get
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
an idea in front of the committee
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
this committee has talked about
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
some type of startup
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know tax exemption or something over
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
the years and we kind of had it
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
most of the members who've been here for
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
a while want to have actual language in
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
front of them
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know like an actual bill before they
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
start rewriting something rather than
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
just having something that's conceptual
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
so it really needed to have a bill come
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
in and i i thought that an llc
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
llcs tend to have a lot of tax and
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
liability benefits so i see a lot of
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
businesses start up as an llc right now
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
so that's why i went with the ll easy
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
llc or qualified llc startup okay um but
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
um just as a matter of comment it may be
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
worth considering other business
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
entities as well as llc's
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
the other another issue that i've
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about
 
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:24.870 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about
um

01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
well uh let's just head to the sect or i
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
guess page two roman numeral four it's
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
on line four
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
this is the section that speaks about
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
when a termination for this deferral
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
might occur
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that um particularly
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
with the permissive language here
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if a business uh
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
falls out of satisfying the requirements
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
it should automatically terminate uh
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
rather than be possible um
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
given that you know we are a revenue
 
01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:58.149 align:start position:0%
given that you know we are a revenue
committee

01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
seeking to help support our state
 
01:56:00.239 --> 01:56:01.189 align:start position:0%
seeking to help support our state
function

01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
by collecting those revenues so i don't
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
believe we should leave it up to an llc
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
to to determine whether or not it should
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
qualify um
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
so maybe that's something to consider
 
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
did you notice that language issue
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
before no what i said what i suggested
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
to legislative services was that that
 
01:56:21.199 --> 01:56:22.390 align:start position:0%
to legislative services was that that
the

01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
exemption and the deferment would only
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
be maintained as long as they continue
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
to qualify and then if there were some
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
calendar year that came along where they
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
maybe exceeded the hundred thousand
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
dollars for payroll or
 
01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
dollars for payroll or
um

01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
failed on some qualification that they
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
would then have to
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
change that year to a different type of
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
llc or a different type of incorporation
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
so i guess
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting that your intent is
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
not translated here
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
in this language that wouldn't be the
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
first time
 
01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:52.709 align:start position:0%
first time
yeah

01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
and then another issue that i have um
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
just down in the
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair a follow-up thank you
 
01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair a follow-up thank you
um

01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
just in the third section where you're
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the committee being
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
established um
 
01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh you state in the third roman numeral
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
that the committee shall study the
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
procedure for formation of llc companies
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
in ways in which the process could be
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
simplified or modified
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
to support business startups
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
are are you aware of
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
the simplicity of the current llc
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
formation capabilities on the secretary
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
of state's website in which um it's
 
01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.229 align:start position:0%
of state's website in which um it's
simply

01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
electronic submission
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
that does not require
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
even legal counsel to do so
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of filling out a few
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
fields and paying a fee
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
i actually went through that process
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
with a startup
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
and it did require several calls to
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office to their
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
corporate division
 
01:57:54.159 --> 01:57:57.750 align:start position:0%
corporate division
and

01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
100 a year filing fee
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
to refile every year
 
01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.390 align:start position:0%
to refile every year
was

01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
surprising to me
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
how do i say this
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
if you really had a business that's
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
really running on a shoestring that
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year every year is
 
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:19.669 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year every year is
is

01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
you know something that they might spend
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
on signs or something that might be
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
trying to spend on software or buying a
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
new laptop
 
01:58:25.599 --> 01:58:26.629 align:start position:0%
new laptop
um

01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
or buying you know new musical gear for
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
a band
 
01:58:29.599 --> 01:58:30.470 align:start position:0%
a band
um

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
when you have businesses that are
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
starting up on a real real shoestring
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
and it's it's
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say it's for fun but
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's just it's it's
 
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.430 align:start position:0%
it's just it's it's
it's

01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
unlikely that the business is going to
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
be profitable
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
you're taking lots and lots of
 
01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:48.629 align:start position:0%
you're taking lots and lots of
businesses

01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
that are running on a shoestring and
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
their their
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
their ultimate success rate is pretty
 
01:58:54.159 --> 01:58:55.430 align:start position:0%
their ultimate success rate is pretty
low

01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
low
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to just
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
exempt them from any feed that i that i
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
possibly can under this
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
to kind of give them the best shot
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
possible of finally breaking even and
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe growing into something maybe
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
actually employing people and hiring
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
their first 5 or 10 people and
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
doing something but
 
01:59:16.229 --> 01:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
when they're when they're first starting
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
out every single dollar is
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know kind of critical
 
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
i i had a i had a business that was uh
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
literally i think it was in a flea
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
market and i i think my
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
revenues were about 100 or 200 a weekend
 
01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:34.950 align:start position:0%
revenues were about 100 or 200 a weekend
so

01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
um they're they're running on a real
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
shoestring and the chance of a a
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
business like that being can you speak
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
under the mic oh i'm sorry
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
i i had a business one time that had
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
gross revenues of literally like one or
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
two hundred dollars per weekend
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
in total sales and net profits were
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much zero for that business
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
um and it's just keeping the thing open
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
and trying to see if that business can
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
can somehow
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
you know expand and uh
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
build some type of customer base and
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair no further questions
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
i think it would just be a lot of
 
02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:14.629 align:start position:0%
i think it would just be a lot of
conversation

02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you mr chair i'd like to
 
02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:17.830 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you mr chair i'd like to
ask

02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
ask
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative hacken phillips could you
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
re-identify those two areas you
 
02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
re-identify those two areas you
mentioned

02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm looking for roman numeral
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
four on page two and i see roman numeral
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
six on page two oh i'm sorry
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's roman numeral six i apologize i
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
must read that uh it's just
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
line four okay page two
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
i was looking at uh the third section
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
about the committee in roman numeral
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
three on line thirty
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
two thirty one three two
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
oh i see it now thank you
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh what
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
do you do about on
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
cases like an entrepreneur that we have
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
in my
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
city which who
 
02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:10.310 align:start position:0%
city which who
uh

02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
carries about
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
20 to
 
02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.070 align:start position:0%
20 to
40

02:01:15.070 --> 02:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
40
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
llcs in his portfolio he
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
he puts every single um
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
store or whatever he's doing in a
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
separate llc to protect them which is
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
common practice actually
 
02:01:31.199 --> 02:01:32.070 align:start position:0%
common practice actually
um

02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.430 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
on so
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
he at any one time is likely to have
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
several of these startups does he
 
02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.510 align:start position:0%
several of these startups does he
qualify

02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
because each one of them is considered a
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
tax entity
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
each one each one would qualify for the
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
tax deferment um
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
the reason i went for a tax deferment is
 
02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:53.669 align:start position:0%
the reason i went for a tax deferment is
i

02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
i look at law in terms of how would
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
somebody abuse it if they really you
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
know if they're really trying to abuse
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think that law especially on
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
commerce i don't think that law is good
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
unless somebody's really tried to you
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
know scrutinize it and make sure that uh
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
it it's hard to take advantage of
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i i could foresee
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
there are some people who have 10 20
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
different llc's right now and they would
 
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
try to take advantage of whatever tax
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
exemption or tax credits that we come up
 
02:02:26.159 --> 02:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
exemption or tax credits that we come up
with

02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why i thought a tax deferment
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
where they're they're deferring the
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
but at the same time they're still going
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
to be paying the interest so he'll get
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
to the end of the five years and they'll
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
still owe the tax
 
02:02:39.679 --> 02:02:41.589 align:start position:0%
still owe the tax
um

02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
he won't
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't completely get out of paying
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
any tax he would still pay the business
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
profits tax if if he has a profitable
 
02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.950 align:start position:0%
profits tax if if he has a profitable
company

02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up and so
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
if he
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh he is not paying the bet
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
so he would have to pay full freight on
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
the bpt at five years unless
 
02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:05.350 align:start position:0%
the bpt at five years unless
he

02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
cuts that business takes that business
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
out and replaces it with something else
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
is that the way it would work well but
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
he would have filed federal
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
tax returns also and if say that he had
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
had a hundred thousand and
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
profits on a particular llc every year
 
02:03:24.629 --> 02:03:24.639 align:start position:0%
for five years
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
um he's still going to have some tax
 
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
liability on that on that llc so by the
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
end of the five years
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's deferred but it's it's still
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
accumulated the tax liability is still
 
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
against him
 
02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.870 align:start position:0%
against him
yes

02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
as i look at this bill i see deferral
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
for both the bet and the bbt i'm not
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
seeing exemption
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be an exemption for the
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax and a deferral
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
on the business profits tax well
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
can you point to the language that
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh legislative services might have aired
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
this is like i say this is the fourth
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
draft of this
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill so some of the earlier drafts did
 
02:04:58.800 --> 02:04:59.910 align:start position:0%
bill so some of the earlier drafts did
have

02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
an exemption from bet so
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay so i just want to point out an
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to the committee that the
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
dra note
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh speaks of deferral
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
not exemption
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
and therefore concludes that basically
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
there's a timing issue here which may be
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
an incomplete conclusion by the way
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
but not and not a
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
loss due to an exemption and in the bill
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
i have a pink card from
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
dan mcguire representing the
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
granite state taxpayers in opposition to
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is dan
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
mcguire i'm here representing granite
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
i'm here today mostly to talk about the
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
following bill but i figured
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is somewhat similar to things
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
i've testified on the past that i'll
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
just briefly
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
explain why we we would oppose it
 
02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:15.589 align:start position:0%
explain why we we would oppose it
and

02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
all my remarks are about sections one
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
and two section three we have no opinion
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
on it might very well be a good idea i
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:06:23.199 --> 02:06:24.550 align:start position:0%
don't know
um

02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
it seems similar to i've testified in
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
the past here against the research and
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
development tax credit
 
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
which is a special purpose kind of tax
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
credit for for particular kinds of
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
businesses and it seems to us that this
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
is somewhat similar it's it's a special
 
02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:42.550 align:start position:0%
is somewhat similar it's it's a special
purpose

02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
tax break whether it's deferral or
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
exemption that we can talk about that
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
but but it's a special purpose
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
to code for a particular kind of
 
02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:53.430 align:start position:0%
to code for a particular kind of
business

02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
and and in general
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
we're much more in favor of uniform
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
taxes applied to all
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
in a certain category in all businesses
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
special breaks for this kind for that
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
kind that sort of thing right um if you
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
pass this kind of of a of a special
 
02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
pass this kind of of a of a special
purpose

02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
tax law
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
it it only encourages others to say wait
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
why don't you give me a special thing
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know i'm very worthy and so on and
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
you start fighting over who is more
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
worthy than who else and all that sort
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
of thing it's it's much more beneficial
 
02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
to just have a uniform
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
low tax rate for everyone
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
um and not try to pick winners and
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
losers and so that's why we're opposed
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:48.560 align:start position:0%

i
wish

02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
wish
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
that i had come up with uh this
 
02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:05.669 align:start position:0%
that i had come up with uh this
monologue

02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
monologue
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's said far better um in this clip
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
that i have right here uh that with the
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
permission of the chair i'd like to play
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the committee because i think it
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
helps illustrate my point
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
what is it you want to do i just i have
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
a little one minute video clip here that
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
i think makes an illustrated point and
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's in the voice of somebody that
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think members of the committee
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
would appreciate uh and it would very
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
much help my testimony if i could play
 
02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:32.070 align:start position:0%
much help my testimony if i could play
it

02:16:32.070 --> 02:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
i will
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
that's enough to make him the richest
 
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
man in the world by far and possibly the
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
richest human being in all of human
 
02:16:49.359 --> 02:16:50.389 align:start position:0%
richest human being in all of human
history

02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
history
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's certainly enough to pay his
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
employees well
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
but he doesn't a huge number of amazon
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
workers are so poorly paid they qualify
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
for federal welfare benefits according
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
to data from the nonprofit group new
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
food economy nearly one in three amazon
 
02:17:08.709 --> 02:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
employees in arizona for example was on
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
food stamps last year
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
jeff bezos isn't paying his workers
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
enough to eat so you made up the
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
difference with your tax dollars next
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
time you see jeff bezos make certain
 
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
that he says thank you
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
what about the walton family they
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
founded walmart collectively they're
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
worth about 175 billion dollars that's
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
more than the entire gross domestic
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
product of qatar the oil rich gulf state
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
the waltons could certainly afford to be
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
generous with their workers instead they
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
count on you to take up the slack in
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
2013 taxpayers sent more than six
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
billion dollars to walmart's employees
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%

02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
his personal fortune is close to five
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
his drivers by considering
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
less than minimum wage
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit but the point is made um
 
02:18:03.599 --> 02:18:04.469 align:start position:0%
a little bit but the point is made um
that

02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
um this is an issue that reaches pretty
 
02:18:10.309 --> 02:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
far across the political spectrum
 
02:18:10.319 --> 02:18:11.030 align:start position:0%
far across the political spectrum
i

02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
did not frankly think that there was
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue that mr carlson and
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
i would agree on
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
but this is a point that he started
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
raising in 2018 about the issue where
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
large employers are
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to pay their employees
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
um pretty well
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
but don't so that they're subsidized
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
through medicaid and food stamps
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is looking to
 
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
go after
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking to stop uh what is often
 
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
deemed corporate welfare the mechanism
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
by which
 
02:18:44.629 --> 02:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
large corporations don't pay well enough
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
that their employees qualify for
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
benefits when they could otherwise be
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
paid well
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
this bill only applies to businesses
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
over 100 employees so we wanted to set
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
the bar very high as to avoid um the
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
perception that we were putting an
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
onerous regulation on small businesses
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the bill says you can either pay
 
02:19:05.669 --> 02:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
a point five percent uh increase in the
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
business profits tax as part of the
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare tax
 
02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare tax
or

02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
you can pay everybody fifteen dollars an
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
hour in your store at least um
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that if you take a
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
company like walmart uh which i have a
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
little first-hand experience with
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
um i worked there for about a month in
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
between jobs in 2021
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
i personally as a truck unloader made
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
about 16 an hour so i wouldn't qualify
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
for this um however
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of the cashiers a lot of the
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
front-end folks are still paid less than
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars an hour if you're a
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
company the size of walmart um or any
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
other those uh more than 100 employee
 
02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:46.309 align:start position:0%
other those uh more than 100 employee
stores

02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
stores
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to be paying less paying
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
people the 15 an hour minimum then you
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be paying the increase in the
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
corporate profits tax and the business
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
profits tax um so it's an if or
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
um we want to provide that option but we
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
also really do want to crack down on
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare because
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
um it's a
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
pretty overwhelmingly popular uh issue
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
to deal with that problem that's what
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
this bill hopes to do
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and i would ask that the committee
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
consider an otp recommendation and send
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
it to the floor so that's what i got
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:20:20.319 --> 02:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
representative

02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
first questions from representative lang
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
i guess my ques my big question is how
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
do we get over the constitutionality and
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitutionality of
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
this issue if you understand part
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
part two article five of our
 
02:20:37.439 --> 02:20:38.790 align:start position:0%
part two article five of our
constitution

02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
which the title says it's about the
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
legislature form of government is to
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
make laws elect officers to find their
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
powers duties impose fines assess taxes
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
prohibit from the authorizing towns of
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
certain aid well i'll talk strictly
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
about the tax component when it talks
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
about taxes it says and to impose and
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
levy proportional and reasonable
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
assessments rates and taxes upon the
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
inhabitants of the and the residents
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
within this state
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
so when i read that that
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
part of the constitution what you're
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
proposing to do is create two different
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
tax rates for different classes of
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
employers if you're over a hundred
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
people but paying less than 15 you're
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
going to pay one tax rate and if you're
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
over a hundred and paying more than 15
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay a different tax rate
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't that not meet the equal and
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
proportional standard is set in our
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
constitution with a levy of taxes
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't interpret that that way
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
because uh we have different tax rates
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
for different taxes
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
um i might just disagree with the
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation on that uh but my
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that language would
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
still hold that this is constitutional
 
02:21:41.359 --> 02:21:42.309 align:start position:0%
still hold that this is constitutional
follow

02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:21:42.319 --> 02:21:43.030 align:start position:0%
follow
oh

02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you i'm trying to
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
understand how he gets the
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional and and i and i
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
understand we might disagree on what
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
equal and proportional is it although a
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
plain read it seems pretty clear that if
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
you have an entity
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is the same
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
they 100 their business with 100
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
employees but you're going to tax them
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
differently based on their corporate
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
policy and i'm trying to understand how
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
you think that that's equal and
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
proportional and it overcomes the
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional hurdle right uh well
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong because i am uh
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
one of the few legislators that will
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
come to hearings and admit that i don't
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
know everything but uh we
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
have a standard by which businesses are
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
required to pay the business profits tax
 
02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
not every business in the state of new
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire pays the business profits tax
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
has to do with their size and their
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
revenue share
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think a similar agreement can be made
 
02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:32.309 align:start position:0%
i think a similar agreement can be made
here

02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
and as such if i were trying to reason
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
with it i would presume that it is
 
02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:38.550 align:start position:0%
with it i would presume that it is
constitutional

02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your
 
02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
testimony i have the same basic
 
02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:48.790 align:start position:0%
testimony i have the same basic
problem

02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
that that i think there's a
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue here as well
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know if i'm i'm company one that
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
makes widgets i'm company in this
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
company too that makes widgets one
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
company pays their employees 12 hours an
 
02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:00.710 align:start position:0%
company pays their employees 12 hours an
hour

02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
hour
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
another company pays them 16
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
an hour so i guess the differentiation
 
02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:06.309 align:start position:0%
an hour so i guess the differentiation
is

02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of the class
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
would be the salary
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know if we want to
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
go down that route but
 
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
go down that route but
again

02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll have to make it up would
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
you believe that this there could be a
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem here
 
02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:24.790 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem here
i

02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:25.990 align:start position:0%
i
personally

02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
personally
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
don't think so because of the standard
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
that i laid out to representative lang
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
about we already have capacity quotas
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
for who pays the business profits tax
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's already a line drawn between
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
businesses who do pay it in businesses
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
that don't pay it what i'm just
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that we enhance the line a
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
little bit and make it a little firmer
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then you'd have to
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
rule the business profits tax and it's
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
entirely unconstitutional that's just my
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
opinion i'm not a lawyer but that's what
 
02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
i would read it as
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
reps unknown
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um representative
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um is this
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
a model legislation from somewhere else
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem that it's written
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
familiarly like we would see be written
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
here did this come from somewhere else
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh the so i can provide a little context
 
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you for the
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
question um in 2018 there was a federal
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
bill filed called the stop bezos act um
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
and if my recollection is correct the
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
ana the acronym is uh
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
it bottoming
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna get it right um but the
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
point is um it did come from a senate
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill it was aimed to create a very
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
complex structure to where
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
um the federal government would charge
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
those massive employers uh the dollar
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
per dollar
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
um return that uh those companies
 
02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
employees were receiving in the medicaid
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
and food stamp reimbursement um
 
02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
tried to construct something like that
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
after attempting that i believe it would
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
have created too much of an onerous
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility on hhs
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the administrative agencies who do
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
allow those benefits to track that and
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
reimburse that
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
so this just seemed like a far more
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
streamlined process
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
under our tax law
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
businesses each business is an entity
 
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
so i've got
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
a friend with on
 
02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:41.270 align:start position:0%
a friend with on
20-something

02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
20-something
 
02:25:45.270 --> 02:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
llcs each of them is an entity
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
not considering them as all belonging to
 
02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
not considering them as all belonging to
him

02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
but on
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
under our constitution
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
to have broad-based taxes equal
 
02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:01.270 align:start position:0%
to have broad-based taxes equal
proportional

02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
across unless
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
we have a reasonable argument which the
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
court will accept
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
which says that
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
there is a good
 
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
reason that the legislature
 
02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:17.349 align:start position:0%
reason that the legislature
has

02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:26:17.359 --> 02:26:19.510 align:start position:0%
has
exempted

02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
exempted
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
a particular group and
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
the only way we've really used this
 
02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:25.349 align:start position:0%
the only way we've really used this
is

02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
to put a floor
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
which is mostly for administrative
 
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
purposes that it costs us more to
 
02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
purposes that it costs us more to
collect

02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
collect
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
than it would to
 
02:26:36.399 --> 02:26:39.429 align:start position:0%
than it would to
on

02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:43.110 align:start position:0%
to um
on

02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
then it would we would get out of it
 
02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:47.190 align:start position:0%
then it would we would get out of it
on

02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
all it originated i believe
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
as the concept that
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
if you are going to tax this business or
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
person into
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
the poor farm we are going to have to
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
that is a very different
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
thing which is i think is what my
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues are trying are saying to you
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's a very different kind of
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
rationale of exemption than the one
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
you're trying to
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
to put in
 
02:27:19.359 --> 02:27:20.469 align:start position:0%
to put in
now

02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
do you agree
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes do you agree with that
 
02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:26.870 align:start position:0%
yes do you agree with that
um

02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the context i'm going to
 
02:27:28.479 --> 02:27:29.670 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the context i'm going to
maintain

02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
my original position is that i would
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
still hold that this would be
 
02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:38.309 align:start position:0%
still hold that this would be
constitutional

02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.319 --> 02:27:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the classification of
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
businesses or no
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
any tax that a business is charged by
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
who ultimately pays that tax i i
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
understand where you're going with that
 
02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:09.190 align:start position:0%
understand where you're going with that
question

02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh the i my understanding is that where
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
you're going with that question is
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
uh that would ultimately be picked up by
 
02:28:18.150 --> 02:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
the consumers is that
 
02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:19.429 align:start position:0%
the consumers is that
okay

02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up mr
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
that therefore would mean that imposing
 
02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
this tax on a business
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
who didn't pay 15 an hour
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
charging more for the product that they
 
02:28:34.399 --> 02:28:35.349 align:start position:0%
charging more for the product that they
were

02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
selling making their product less
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
appetizing on the market as we heard it
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
in an earlier bill than would be
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
a larger business making the same
 
02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:48.150 align:start position:0%
a larger business making the same
product

02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
well i
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
with all due respect uh representative
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
vollery um
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
because i understood where the question
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
was going didn't mean that i agreed with
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
the premise
 
02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:58.230 align:start position:0%
the premise
um

02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
i there has to be a way to go after
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare um i think it is an
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
indefensible system where large
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
corporations are able to
 
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
essentially bankroll programs like
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid and social security and food
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
stamps into their own bottom line
 
02:29:13.359 --> 02:29:14.469 align:start position:0%
stamps into their own bottom line
um

02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:14.479 --> 02:29:15.429 align:start position:0%
um
maybe

02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
this isn't the perfect way but i think
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's the best effort that i've seen
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
speaking a little biasedly there
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
um but there's just there's got to be a
 
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
way to do it um
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know you can
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
technically any tax or anything is you
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
know can be moved down the line uh to
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
the next person but
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the issue of corporate
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
welfare is a really really big issue and
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
one that needs to be gone after happy to
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
work with any member of the committee
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
who has any other ideas on how to
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
address this um because you know there
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
is even in conservative realms
 
02:29:52.309 --> 02:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
opposition to this kind of uh practice
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
but um this is what i got and i will try
 
02:29:57.270 --> 02:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
to defend it the best i can
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
one follow-up okay follow up
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind sir
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the new hampshire
 
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
median wage is 65
 
02:30:09.240 --> 02:30:10.870 align:start position:0%
median wage is 65
421

02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
421
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
or about 32 an hour
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
yes i am i am also aware that there are
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
corporations that would be
 
02:30:18.479 --> 02:30:19.429 align:start position:0%
corporations that would be
um

02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
categorized under this bill as
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
applicable and attack in the tax who do
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
pay less than 15 an hour and as a
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
consequence their employees are eligible
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
for benefits that they do not need to be
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
eligible for because those corporations
 
02:30:36.309 --> 02:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman any further
 
02:30:40.389 --> 02:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you for your
 
02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:49.270 --> 02:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
um called dan mcguire representing the
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
granite state taxpayers
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman for the
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
record my name is dan mcguire i'm here
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
on behalf of granite state taxpayers
 
02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:04.870 align:start position:0%
on behalf of granite state taxpayers
um

02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
our opposition to this bill starts right
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
on line one
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh the actual be known as a stop
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare act
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's got to be one of the silliest
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
things i've ever read in a bill
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
to characterize a tax that is uniform
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
across all businesses
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
as welfare for particular businesses or
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
welfare in general
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
i mean that is just silly
 
02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:34.710 align:start position:0%
i mean that is just silly
um

02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know is the fact that we tax
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and hotel rooms but we don't
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
tax shampoo is that somehow welfare for
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
procter and gamble
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know it just doesn't make sense so i
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
would hope that even if
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
on the unlikely event that you find this
 
02:31:54.389 --> 02:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
ought to pass you would at least
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
get rid of that silliness all right but
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
the the bill itself
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
is basically trying to shoehorn
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage argument into our tax
 
02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:08.309 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage argument into our tax
code

02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
code
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
um minimum wage is something that's
 
02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:12.070 align:start position:0%
um minimum wage is something that's
regularly

02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
argued in the legislature
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
every session
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
and it's very common and it goes
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
different ways at different times
 
02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:22.150 align:start position:0%
different ways at different times
but

02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's something that's
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
there's a whole committee dedicated to
 
02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
those kinds of issues the labor
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
committee and it's something that is
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
very much appropriate there
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
and not here
 
02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:36.870 align:start position:0%
and not here
um

02:32:36.870 --> 02:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:37.990 align:start position:0%
um
in

02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
to somehow
 
02:32:39.439 --> 02:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
to somehow
um

02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
get into taxes and and and
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
and try to
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
um control something that is much easier
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
more easily handled in in another venue
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is just inappropriate i mean this
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
particular bill i'm i you know i i don't
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
really want to get into
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
arguing the minimum wage itself i
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
i remember
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
making a floor speech on it once myself
 
02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:10.469 align:start position:0%
making a floor speech on it once myself
but

02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:33:10.479 --> 02:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
but
um

02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
but it's just
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
let's not
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
kind of pollute our tax code with with
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
special purpose things that are much
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
more easily handled in other parts
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
of the rsis
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:29.990 align:start position:0%
take questions
questions

02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
next is dave gervais from the bia
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is dave
 
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
giuve i'm a senior vice president with
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
the business and industry association we
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
are here in opposition to this bill
 
02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to divide my comments into
 
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
two different buckets or silos the first
 
02:34:09.270 --> 02:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
is is this good public policy
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the second is if it is good public
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
policy are there issues that will need
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
to be addressed
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
i would like to suggest this is bad
 
02:34:20.710 --> 02:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
public policy and i'll explain why
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
although there are some states around
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
the country whose constitutions do allow
 
02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:27.590 align:start position:0%
the country whose constitutions do allow
different

02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
tax rates
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
none of them that i'm aware of are
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
basing those tax rates on whether a
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
single job within a corporation or
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
company is paying 15 an hour or less
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
so the message you would be sending to
 
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country if you pass this
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
bill is if you're a large employer we
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't want you here we don't want you
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
and we don't want the jobs that you
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be bringing here
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
so i suggest just on that merit alone
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
that you would find this to be an
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
expedient however if you think it is
 
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
good public policy then here's some
 
02:35:04.230 --> 02:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
questions i think you need to consider
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
the first is why is this just limited to
 
02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax there are many
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
larger employers around the state in the
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
non-profit sector and in the service
 
02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:15.750 align:start position:0%
non-profit sector and in the service
sector

02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
sector
 
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
that have more than a hundred employees
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
that are likely paying less than fifteen
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour for some of their uh
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
positions there are only business
 
02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
enterprise taxpayers they don't pay the
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
business profits tax why are they exempt
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
from this
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
how would a company that is a business
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
profits taxpayer be treated if they had
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
a hundred uh and one employees one of
 
02:35:38.479 --> 02:35:39.429 align:start position:0%
a hundred uh and one employees one of
whom

02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
whom
 
02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
received a
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
wage of less than 15 an hour
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
but then throughout the course of the
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
year they lost several employees and now
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
they're at 99 employees how would their
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
tax be treated
 
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
and secondly
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
how would you justify a company that is
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
a hundred employees that has one
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
individual making 15 an hour or less
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
and you have another company that has 99
 
02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:05.510 align:start position:0%
and you have another company that has 99
employees

02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
50 of whom make 50 15 an hour or less
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
one would be paying the higher tax but
 
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
not the other how is that justifiable
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'd also ask you to consider how will
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
this impact those industries and
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
companies around the state that are
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
a high employee count but very low
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
volume i'm talking about restaurants
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
and food stores
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
and retail establishment and hotels
 
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
they uh the very nature of their type of
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
business requires a lot of employees
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
but they all
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
operate on very low margins so what
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
impact would this have on their uh
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
taxes and and their costs to run a
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire so mr chair i
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
could probably go on but i don't want to
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
monopolize all the time i know there are
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
others here to speak on the bill i would
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%

representative

02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question mr
 
02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:17.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question mr
duvet

02:37:17.190 --> 02:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
duvet
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
does the wage paid by a business affect
 
02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:21.830 align:start position:0%
does the wage paid by a business affect
the

02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that it has an impact
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
but not the only impact and and i'll use
 
02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
the times we are operating in now as an
 
02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:41.510 align:start position:0%
the times we are operating in now as an
example

02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
i was recently in uh house labor
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee where a similar question came
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
up and my response to the committee
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
was i receive calls almost daily from
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
our members who are struggling to find
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
employees and they're asking a simple
 
02:37:56.640 --> 02:37:57.510 align:start position:0%
employees and they're asking a simple
question

02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
what are other employers paying right
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
now and um
 
02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
and the answer is everyone's paying more
 
02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that's what it's taking to
 
02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
to attract people into the the workplace
 
02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:11.750 align:start position:0%
to attract people into the the workplace
so

02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
like representative mcguire i don't want
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
to you know get into a discussion of the
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
minimum wage but but when those
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
discussions come up what we quickly find
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
out is most uh employers around the
 
02:38:27.910 --> 02:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
state even those that you would think of
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
as being generally lower wage employers
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
like fast food restaurants
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
are either paying 15 an hour sometimes
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
higher to get individuals in to work
 
02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:40.630 align:start position:0%
higher to get individuals in to work
there

02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
the next is greg moore from the american
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
for prosperity in new hampshire
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee certainly appreciate the
 
02:38:59.349 --> 02:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be before the house ways
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
and means committee uh for the record my
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
name is greg moore i am the state
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
director with americans for prosperity
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
and and we oppose house bill 1478 for a
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
number of reasons the first of which was
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
obviously brought up by representative
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
lang representative primary
 
02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative alame which of course um
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
our constitution requires that our taxes
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
be uniformly applied and broadly based i
 
02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't know how you can argue that this
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
is uniformly applied when there creates
 
02:39:25.750 --> 02:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
three categories of employers one
 
02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
category being
 
02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.070 align:start position:0%
category being
business

02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that pay 15 as well as as the
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
prior speaker mentioned
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that don't pay business
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
businesses that don't pay 15 an hour
 
02:39:40.710 --> 02:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
that are greater than 100 and then
 
02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
businesses that don't pay 15 that are
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
under 100 so there's three different
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
groups of
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
classes of taxpayers that are not
 
02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
treated equally that's the first issue
 
02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
the second issue
 
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
of course is the issue of
 
02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
creating these additional deformities to
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
the tax code we certainly oppose the
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
idea of of adding more of these uh as
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
committee might remember we certainly
 
02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're not fans of the of the army tax
 
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
exemption we don't support continued
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
expansion of the
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
we believe that the better strategy are
 
02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
low rates for all and not having
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
government government do anything to
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
pick winners and pick winners and losers
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
and and this this bill does pick winners
 
02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
and losers um
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
third one's more of uh just just as
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
someone who used to work with the house
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh just advise this committee don't do
 
02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
this to yourself
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't allow
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
work from other committees to start
 
02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
working its way into this committee
 
02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
and just push back and make sure it
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
stays in the committee it belongs and
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
this is a labor issue and should belong
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the labor committee as a prior
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
speaker mentioned
 
02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a an important
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
consideration for the long-term workload
 
02:40:49.269 --> 02:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
of this committee you guys have enough
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
on your plate as it is now
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then and and then uh just
 
02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
fundamentally uh obviously we oppose tax
 
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
increases and this bill is would be a
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
tax increase we believe that there's
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
been tremendous success in
 
02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
the work the state has done over the
 
02:41:07.030 --> 02:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
course of the last uh seven years or so
 
02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
as it relates to uh tax policy with the
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
bet and bbt we think that's been very
 
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
successful and we think going in the
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
opposite direction is a bad idea so with
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
that those are our reasons for opposing
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%

my name is curtis barry here
 
02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire retail
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
association which as you know represents
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
several hundred businesses across the
 
02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
state ranging from major national chains
 
02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:55.269 align:start position:0%
state ranging from major national chains
to

02:41:55.269 --> 02:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
smaller main street shops in opposition
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
02:41:58.880 --> 02:41:59.910 align:start position:0%
to this bill
um

02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
we start by saying i think uh i would
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
agree on behalf of the retailers with
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
everything mr zhuvay said but i'd like
 
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
to give you a retail specific spin on it
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
if you will and sort of categorize my
 
02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
testimony in the same two areas um first
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
of all i think you're all aware that
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
retail is a very seasonal business there
 
02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
are times of the year depending on what
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
the type of retailer is they're much
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
busier than than other times curtis can
 
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
you move your sorry closer sure
 
02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
how's that
great

02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and because of that
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
seasonal nature
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
many times retailers will hire folks
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
that not only are school students high
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
school and college but also retired
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
folks looking to pick up a little extra
 
02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:44.469 align:start position:0%
folks looking to pick up a little extra
money

02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
could be a flower shop around mother's
 
02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:47.750 align:start position:0%
could be a flower shop around mother's
day

02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:48.790 align:start position:0%
day
in

02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
they may accept a wage because it's good
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
work for them
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's a little lower than what they pay
 
02:42:56.469 --> 02:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
everybody else in in representative
 
02:42:58.230 --> 02:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
schoenberg i would like to answer your
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
question as well at the end of this i
 
02:43:01.670 --> 02:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
think to provide some context
 
02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:03.030 align:start position:0%
think to provide some context
um

02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill has the
 
02:43:08.309 --> 02:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
would have the impact perhaps of denying
 
02:43:10.389 --> 02:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
somebody that opportunity because it
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
would drive a higher tax rate
 
02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
as mr zhuvay said it could be a
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
shop of 100 or more people and one
 
02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:19.030 align:start position:0%
shop of 100 or more people and one
person

02:43:19.030 --> 02:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
is hired on a part-time basis to answer
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
some phones as a busy time to take
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
orders and it could be 12 bucks an hour
 
02:43:26.070 --> 02:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
but it's they want to pick up a little
 
02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
extra spending money which would deny
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
them this opportunity because it kicks
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
the business into a higher tax rate
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
this bill does not contemplate i don't
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
think retail employees who work on a
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
commission basis their hourly rate may
 
02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
be lower but they make pretty good money
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
because the rest is made up of
 
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
commissions so there's a lot of
 
02:43:47.429 --> 02:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
specifics in the retail industry that
 
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:51.290 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:52.389 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
mirror what you've heard before from
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire mr jouve
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
i hope we would all agree
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
that the tax code is not there for
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
punitive measures to punish an employer
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
because they engage in a business
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
practice that we don't like
 
02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
once you start down this road it has
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
literally no end
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
um and then to provide the context and i
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
think address representative schomburg's
 
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
question i will give you a real
 
02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
life example that i just an hour ago
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
gave to the house labor committee
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of a particular
 
02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
major retailer
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
with a store in the southern part of the
 
02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:34.150 align:start position:0%
with a store in the southern part of the
state

02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
that in trying to hire for the holiday
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
season back in the fall
 
02:44:41.910 --> 02:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
found themselves 45 positions short for
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
the holiday season one single location
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
45 positions short of what they would
 
02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
consider optimal
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
they hired 30 people
 
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
signed them up ready to go
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
who never showed up to work
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
didn't call didn't give any notice
 
02:44:59.110 --> 02:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
didn't show up
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is on top of incentives for example
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
several hundred dollars for finishing
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
out the holiday season
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
added uh hourly wage to work weekend
 
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
shifts and they're not finding uh the
 
02:45:14.309 --> 02:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
employees they're so employers are
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
facing these pressures
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
all around
 
02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm happy to answer
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
questions as best i can
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony mr barry
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you thank you oops
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to ask
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
on whether it would cost considerably
 
02:45:41.910 --> 02:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
more for these
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
businesses that are hiring seasonally
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
part-time we're talking about an hourly
 
02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:48.870 align:start position:0%
part-time we're talking about an hourly
wage

02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
giving them another three dollars an
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
hour for that period would probably be a
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
lot cheaper than
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know than the raise in since
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're on such a low margin it might
 
02:46:03.359 --> 02:46:04.950 align:start position:0%
they're on such a low margin it might
not

02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and it's a
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
question again that comes up not
 
02:46:09.990 --> 02:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
infrequently upstairs in the labor
 
02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee on similar issues
 
02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:13.030 align:start position:0%
committee on similar issues
um

02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
and i hope we all recognize that not
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
only is it low margin in the retail
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
business but it's very price sensitive
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
so i think retailers
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
whether it be store manager for a larger
 
02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
one store owner for a smaller one
 
02:46:30.150 --> 02:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
understands their market and understands
 
02:46:32.230 --> 02:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
that balance because
 
02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh when a consumer is making a decision
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
to purchase product
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
it could be a decision between product a
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
and product b
 
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
um i'll go back to my flower shop
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
arrangement it could be
 
02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
if the price were a little lower they
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
would pick the larger arrangement which
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
maybe has a bigger profit margin and if
 
02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
the price is a little higher they're
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to pick the smaller one but
 
02:46:57.990 --> 02:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
consumers also make decisions between
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
product a and not no product at all i
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
can't afford this at a higher rate so
 
02:47:06.309 --> 02:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
i think folks on the ground that are in
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
this situation living the business day
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
to day are in the best position to make
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
send none question mr chairman i'm sorry
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
for being so small
 
02:47:22.389 --> 02:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
so are you saying then that
 
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
higher wages
 
02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
are the cause for
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
a product not being on shelves and
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:36.150 align:start position:0%
things like that
um

02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
feel free to cut me off anytime so i
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
think we're getting a little bit off
 
02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
topic but i'd like to to respond to that
 
02:47:44.790 --> 02:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
um not not the sole weight not the sole
 
02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:46.150 align:start position:0%
um not not the sole weight not the sole
reason

02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
i guess what i was suggesting
 
02:47:47.439 --> 02:47:48.630 align:start position:0%
i guess what i was suggesting
representative

02:47:48.630 --> 02:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
is that any additional cost
 
02:47:54.070 --> 02:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
that retailers experience
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
will have an impact one way or another
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
it will be either higher prices
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
or it will be a lower margin for the
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
retailer or it will be
 
02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
fewer hours that they hire somebody to
 
02:48:06.389 --> 02:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
in the example i wish to give you again
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
i gave this this is a real life example
 
02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
i just gave to the labor committee
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
furniture stores are now telling us
 
02:48:16.550 --> 02:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
telling their customers you order a
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
but the impact that that weight is
 
02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
solely on the story if you put a deposit
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
down on a piece of furniture
 
02:48:31.349 --> 02:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's at a certain price uh 12 months
 
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
later shipping costs in particular
 
02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
nowadays have increased and that's
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
driven by the container costs coming in
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
from overseas which have doubled or
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
tripled uh it's the hourly rate that the
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
the trucker is
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
getting at this point
 
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
but the store cannot pass that along to
 
02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
that consumer in that particular
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance the customer has agreed to
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
buy a piece of furniture at a particular
 
02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:53.349 align:start position:0%
buy a piece of furniture at a particular
price

02:48:53.349 --> 02:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
price
 
02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
so there's two choices either the
 
02:48:57.269 --> 02:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
customer cancels which is in nobody's
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
best interest
 
02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh or the store eats the increase in
 
02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
cost over over that 12 months having
 
02:49:04.630 --> 02:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
accepted a deposit for a piece of
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
furniture at a certain price it is not
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
easy to be in the retail business these
 
02:49:08.399 --> 02:49:10.230 align:start position:0%
easy to be in the retail business these
days

02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions and none thank you
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you sir
 
02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
and the last card is
 
02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:19.110 align:start position:0%
and the last card is
drew

02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
drew
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
klein uh representing josiah bartlett
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh and committee
 
02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief because everybody else
 
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
stole my thunder and made all the points
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
i was going to make about
 
02:49:35.349 --> 02:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
constitutionality and and use of the tax
 
02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
code um but i just wanted to suggest um
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know a former representative
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
suggests the title is
 
02:49:45.190 --> 02:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh maybe inaccurate and i would maybe
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
offer a different title for it um
 
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
something like
 
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
the entry-level job elimination act
 
02:49:53.110 --> 02:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
or um
 
02:49:55.990 --> 02:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
or the or the electronic kiosk full
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
employment act
 
02:49:59.429 --> 02:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
um because what this would do
 
02:49:59.439 --> 02:50:00.230 align:start position:0%
um because what this would do
uh

02:50:00.230 --> 02:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think the foundational
 
02:50:02.710 --> 02:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding is that not aside from
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality and the use of the
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
tax code is that uh misunderstanding
 
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
what a job is a job is an exchange of
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
compensation for services rendered and a
 
02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
job is not
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
does not exist not every job exists
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
to support a whole family so
 
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
whether you even if you have over 100
 
02:50:22.230 --> 02:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
employees i mean there are manufacturers
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
based in new hampshire there are
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
companies based in new hampshire that
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
aren't amazon and target and et cetera
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
they have more than 100 employees and
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they are paying entry-level wages
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
at 13 14 an hour
 
02:50:36.630 --> 02:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
and this would punish them for that and
 
02:50:38.790 --> 02:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh and it would discourage them from
 
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
offering those entry-level jobs to get
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
people up to speed i mean
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
we hear from employers all the time that
 
02:50:46.710 --> 02:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
they pay a lower wage for entry level
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
because that person has less experience
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
and then as that person gains experience
 
02:50:51.990 --> 02:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
and becomes therefore more valuable to
 
02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
the employer the wages go up
 
02:50:56.790 --> 02:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
um and right now you can see what
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
happens in an economy when
 
02:50:59.279 --> 02:51:00.389 align:start position:0%
happens in an economy when
um

02:51:00.389 --> 02:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:02.550 --> 02:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
the pressure on wages is so great that
 
02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:03.429 align:start position:0%
the pressure on wages is so great that
the

02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
those entry-level jobs become
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
uneconomical for the employer so if you
 
02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
go to any mcdonald's you'll see the
 
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
kiosks up um i would suggest that this
 
02:51:12.640 --> 02:51:14.070 align:start position:0%
kiosks up um i would suggest that this
would

02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
expand that
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
greatly so and it's not you know again
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
we we think of this often in terms of
 
02:51:22.950 --> 02:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
the large mega corporation that's super
 
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
rich but
 
02:51:26.710 --> 02:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
um the bill says over 100 employees not
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
over 100 employees in new hampshire
 
02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:29.670 align:start position:0%
over 100 employees in new hampshire
so

02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are other industries that this
 
02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
would affect that operate on low margins
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
that aren't necessarily big wealthy
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
corporations and i'll just throw out one
 
02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
um that's been really affected by the
 
02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic is movie theaters so a lot of
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
the there are some independent movie
 
02:51:43.830 --> 02:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
theaters in new hampshire but there are
 
02:51:45.190 --> 02:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
some movie theaters in new hampshire
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
that are part of large
 
02:51:49.110 --> 02:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
um out-of-state companies and movie
 
02:51:50.870 --> 02:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
theater i i my first job as a movie
 
02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
theater i love it i love movie theaters
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
they pay lower wages generally because
 
02:51:58.150 --> 02:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's very low skilled to take tickets
 
02:52:01.030 --> 02:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
and to get somebody a soda um
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
they are already transitioning to
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
primarily kiosks and um i think this
 
02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
would make the customer experience worse
 
02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
by forcing them to pay 15 an hour for a
 
02:52:13.349 --> 02:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
job that
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily worth that to them
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
but that they can then
 
02:52:19.269 --> 02:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh replace with an electronic
 
02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
interaction for the customer so i just
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
think there are lots of unintended
 
02:52:23.590 --> 02:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
consequences here that committee ought
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
to be aware of and that's all
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
02:52:30.230 --> 02:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:47.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
representative camaro speaking in
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um as a co-sponsor i
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to say much but i i
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
signed on because i thought this was a
 
02:53:05.910 --> 02:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
topic that needed to be discussed and
 
02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
as it turns out we've had more pink
 
02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
cards for this bill than any other
 
02:53:13.269 --> 02:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
as a business owner
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to give a little bit of my
 
02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:17.429 align:start position:0%
i'd like to give a little bit of my
perspective

02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
i married into a family business
 
02:53:23.510 --> 02:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
established in 1939
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
it was a grocery store at first and then
 
02:53:29.190 --> 02:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
my husband expanded it some
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
we sold
 
02:53:32.830 --> 02:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
the grocery business in
 
02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:34.630 align:start position:0%
the grocery business in
2016

02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
2016
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
and we've kept the gas station
 
02:53:40.150 --> 02:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i've had three workers that i've
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
paid over 15 an hour since then
 
02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
and i just want you to know that it can
 
02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't need billionaires
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
people just need to take care of their
 
02:53:52.550 --> 02:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
own like they used to
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
and so that's my testimony and i'll take
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%

02:54:30.469 --> 02:54:30.479 align:start position:0%

02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:34.550 align:start position:0%
is king manuel uh deary
um

02:54:34.550 --> 02:54:34.560 align:start position:0%

02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
move the mic closer to you
 
02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
02:54:41.269 --> 02:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay better um in terms of the
 
02:54:41.279 --> 02:54:42.510 align:start position:0%
okay better um in terms of the
constitution

02:54:42.510 --> 02:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
constitutionality issue
 
02:54:47.030 --> 02:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
according to our fiscal notes we have
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
not done a review on the on that
 
02:54:52.070 --> 02:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
particular issue so um
 
02:54:54.309 --> 02:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
we can't really comment on that but
 
02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
hearing what uh representative army was
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
saying earlier
 
02:54:58.319 --> 02:54:59.110 align:start position:0%
saying earlier
um

02:54:59.110 --> 02:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
the the floor for the bpt or the bet
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
in my perspective i don't think it
 
02:55:10.469 --> 02:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
creates separate classes of taxpayers
 
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore um
 
02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's not a constitutional issue
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
but this one um
 
02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:17.670 align:start position:0%
but this one um
from

02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
from what i read it looks like it is
 
02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:20.550 align:start position:0%
from what i read it looks like it is
creating

02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
creating
 
02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:21.349 align:start position:0%
creating
um

02:55:21.349 --> 02:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:23.910 --> 02:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
separate classes so it could be a
 
02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
potential issue but once again um we
 
02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
have not done that particular analysis
 
02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
so i would hesitate to comment further
 
02:55:34.710 --> 02:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:37.349 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to testify for or
 
02:55:47.349 --> 02:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh paul would you check to see if there
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
are any
 
02:56:10.870 --> 02:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:19.279 --> 02:56:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:20.560 align:start position:0%

longer introduction
 
04:01:16.160 --> 04:01:18.550 align:start position:0%
longer introduction
so

04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
for many many years earlier in my life i
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
used to hike extensively in the white
 
04:01:22.960 --> 04:01:23.910 align:start position:0%
used to hike extensively in the white
mountains

04:01:23.910 --> 04:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
mountains
 
04:01:23.920 --> 04:01:26.229 align:start position:0%
mountains
and

04:01:26.229 --> 04:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
with my hiking buddies we would often
 
04:01:28.800 --> 04:01:30.070 align:start position:0%
with my hiking buddies we would often
discuss

04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
reports that we had seen about
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
hiking expeditions that had gone wrong
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
accidents that had happened people had
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
gotten hurt etcetera now we always used
 
04:01:40.960 --> 04:01:42.070 align:start position:0%
gotten hurt etcetera now we always used
to

04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:42.080 --> 04:01:43.349 align:start position:0%
to
question

04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
what mistake did they make that led to
 
04:01:48.309 --> 04:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
that accident
 
04:01:52.550 --> 04:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
and what we learned over time is that
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
accidents don't typically happen because
 
04:01:57.269 --> 04:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
of one cause sometimes they do but not
 
04:02:00.150 --> 04:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
typically usually it's an
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
accumulation of small mistakes
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
that lead to a bad outcome
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
well the same can be true in reverse
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
and an accumulation of small
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why i introduced house bill
 
04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
1494 it's a small bill
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
the tax cut that it proposes
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
is modest two and a half maybe to maybe
 
04:02:31.510 --> 04:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
three and a half million dollars a year
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
but that additional
 
04:02:34.560 --> 04:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
but that additional
money

04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
could have a big impact
 
04:02:40.630 --> 04:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is because
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic of course we learned
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
that broadband internet is vital
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
to our state to the citizens of our
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
state it enables remote learning it
 
04:02:52.399 --> 04:02:53.830 align:start position:0%
state it enables remote learning it
enables

04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
enables
 
04:02:58.710 --> 04:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we've worked hard over the course of
 
04:03:04.150 --> 04:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
the last 10 15 years to expand broadband
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
in our state and we're we're pretty
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
close about 95 percent of the people in
 
04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
in our state have decent broadband
 
04:03:11.680 --> 04:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
in our state have decent broadband
service

04:03:13.030 --> 04:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
getting to that
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
last five percent
 
04:03:19.750 --> 04:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
what's frequently returned to referred
 
04:03:22.150 --> 04:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
to as the last mile
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
is difficult and expensive
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
so everything we can do
 
04:03:28.000 --> 04:03:30.630 align:start position:0%
so everything we can do
to

04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
get a step closer
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
to solving the last mile problem
 
04:03:35.520 --> 04:03:36.870 align:start position:0%
to solving the last mile problem
is

04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:45.510 --> 04:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
one of the ways we can get there is to
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the costs of expanding broadband
 
04:03:53.670 --> 04:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and that's the small step
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
that this legislation will take
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
by reducing taxes
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
on broadband
 
04:04:00.080 --> 04:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
on broadband
suppliers

04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
by a modest amount that they can then
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
turn around and invest in broadband
 
04:04:06.720 --> 04:04:11.590 align:start position:0%
turn around and invest in broadband
expansion

04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
this is a high priority for
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in our state i served in
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
my third term my second term i'm sorry
 
04:04:24.630 --> 04:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
on a broadband study committee and
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
we looked at this issue for
 
04:04:27.120 --> 04:04:29.510 align:start position:0%
we looked at this issue for
months

04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
months
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
and discovered that it's a very tough
 
04:04:33.030 --> 04:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
issue to solve
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
and there had been previous broadband
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
study committees which also had looked
 
04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
at this issue and not come up with any
 
04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
easy solutions either
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
but we've got to solve this problem it's
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
a high priority for the business and
 
04:04:45.120 --> 04:04:47.110 align:start position:0%
a high priority for the business and
industry

04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
association for example they recognize
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
the critical role of telecommunications
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
and high-speed internet
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
and fostering a healthy growing economy
 
04:04:57.750 --> 04:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
and they support efforts it's a
 
04:05:01.680 --> 04:05:02.790 align:start position:0%
and they support efforts it's a
legislative

04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
priority for the bia
 
04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
to support efforts to expand private
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
sector telecommunications infrastructure
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
to improve access quality and
 
04:05:13.920 --> 04:05:17.990 align:start position:0%
to improve access quality and
reliability

04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
so how will this bill contribute to that
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
there are people who will testify after
 
04:05:24.630 --> 04:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
me that will give you a more detailed
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
and nuanced explanation for how it works
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
but i'll give you a broad overview the
 
04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill simply adds an exception an
 
04:05:32.160 --> 04:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
bill simply adds an exception an
exemption

04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
similar to exemptions that already exist
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
from a property tax on the use of
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
way now broadband vendors today often
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
pay tax twice
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
on using these
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
rights of way because they pay property
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
tax on the polls and conduits
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
the the hardware infrastructure but they
 
04:06:00.630 --> 04:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
also pay again
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
to use the right-of-way
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
this exemption would
 
04:06:09.359 --> 04:06:11.189 align:start position:0%
this exemption would
reduce

04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
or exempt them from paying the polls and
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions like this one are already
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
provided to to charitable organizations
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
to agricultural agriculture uses as well
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
as state-owned railroad property so this
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
is not a unique exemption this is just
 
04:06:34.150 --> 04:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
an exempt an extension of an exemption
 
04:06:36.630 --> 04:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
that already exists
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
and what this bill will do it will level
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
the playing field for
 
04:06:41.040 --> 04:06:42.790 align:start position:0%
the playing field for
vendors

04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it'll reduce the fixed costs of
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
deploying broadband infrastructure
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
this bill will also go along with the
 
04:06:51.279 --> 04:06:52.150 align:start position:0%
this bill will also go along with the
theme

04:06:52.150 --> 04:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
theme
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
governor sununu administration that
 
04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
started uh in 2021
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
of reducing taxes that was a
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
broad theme of his administration for
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
the biennium that we're currently in and
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
this continues that tradition
 
04:07:12.150 --> 04:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
of reducing taxes
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
in a responsible and reasonable way
 
04:07:15.359 --> 04:07:16.229 align:start position:0%
in a responsible and reasonable way
that

04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the long term
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
will help our st our citizens statewide
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
another small benefit that might result
 
04:07:27.269 --> 04:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
from this bill is
 
04:07:29.189 --> 04:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
vendors who would benefit from this bill
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
actually provide landline telephone
 
04:07:34.720 --> 04:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
actually provide landline telephone
service

04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:07:37.590 --> 04:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
and they actually list on their bills a
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
right-of-way charge
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
and they could reduce that charge if
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass won't affect cell
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
phones but would affect landline phones
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
as i said
 
04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago there are folks who
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
are going to testify behind me who
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
can give you more details
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
but that's the broad overview of what
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
this bill does and i'm happy to
 
04:08:00.790 --> 04:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
introduce it and also happy to take
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:08:04.399 --> 04:08:06.229 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony

representative
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative schomburg
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:08:11.040 --> 04:08:16.469 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
representative

04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
is this a loss of revenue for towns and
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
an increase in a town's tax rate to
 
04:08:22.239 --> 04:08:23.429 align:start position:0%
an increase in a town's tax rate to
overcome

04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
overcome
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
this loss of revenue
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
yes this would be a small loss of
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
revenue to municipalities
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
estimated to be about two and a half to
 
04:08:35.429 --> 04:08:35.439 align:start position:0%
three and a half million statewide so
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
per municipality it would be a
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
relatively small number
 
04:08:41.740 --> 04:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman follow up
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:44.309 align:start position:0%

04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
you stated by reducing the taxes on
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
broadband suppliers
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
have the broadband suppliers or vendors
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
made a commitment to finish the last
 
04:08:54.000 --> 04:08:55.349 align:start position:0%
made a commitment to finish the last
mile

04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
mile
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
there will be representatives of
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
broadband companies testifying after me
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
you could ask them that question
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh in general i think they have made
 
04:09:10.149 --> 04:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
that commitment but we're getting there
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
the details of getting there
 
04:09:12.080 --> 04:09:12.950 align:start position:0%
the details of getting there
are

04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
what we're here to address today thank
 
04:09:15.359 --> 04:09:17.189 align:start position:0%
what we're here to address today thank
you

04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:09:17.199 --> 04:09:19.030 align:start position:0%
you
representative

04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:09:22.960 --> 04:09:24.710 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
my my question is
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying this is a
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
two and a half million dollar tax cut
 
04:09:32.720 --> 04:09:34.389 align:start position:0%
two and a half million dollar tax cut
fine

04:09:34.389 --> 04:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
and this would be
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
this supposedly this money be used for
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
expanding or
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully expanding broadband
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
and we have what you said five percent
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:09:46.560 --> 04:09:47.590 align:start position:0%
of the
state

04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:09:47.600 --> 04:09:48.710 align:start position:0%
state
still

04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
still
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
is in need of that what is that dollar
 
04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
amount needed to to fulfill that and
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
expand that to do the last mile as
 
04:09:56.239 --> 04:09:57.590 align:start position:0%
expand that to do the last mile as
you've

04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
you've
 
04:09:57.600 --> 04:09:59.590 align:start position:0%
you've
indicated

04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good question maybe one of the
 
04:10:01.760 --> 04:10:02.950 align:start position:0%
that's a good question maybe one of the
broadband

04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
folks who testify later could answer
 
04:10:04.960 --> 04:10:06.229 align:start position:0%
folks who testify later could answer
that

04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
further question representative lyon
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
representatives for taking my question i
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear on the 2 million
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
dollars we're talking about is that part
 
04:10:19.030 --> 04:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the state upt
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
or is that the local property tax loss
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
that you think is going to happen
 
04:10:27.030 --> 04:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
these are municipal taxes thank you
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
further questions represent elmi
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it's on the five
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
percent that
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
do not yet have broadband is that
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
calculated from census tracts or from
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
household survey
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
yes from
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
my recollection of serving on the
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
broadband study committee that i served
 
04:10:53.520 --> 04:10:54.309 align:start position:0%
broadband study committee that i served
on

04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:01.910 --> 04:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
i believe the answer to your question is
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
a census
 
04:11:06.070 --> 04:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'd have to go look it up to be sure
 
04:11:06.080 --> 04:11:08.710 align:start position:0%
i'd have to go look it up to be sure
though

04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you it does make an enormous
 
04:11:10.720 --> 04:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
thank you it does make an enormous
difference

04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.149 --> 04:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
the next is a chris hodgson

[Music]
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is chris hodgston i'm
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
comcast vice president of government
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
affairs here in new hampshire
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
and my testimony is being distributed
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
now it touches on half dozen or so
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
policy reasons why we support this
 
04:12:16.479 --> 04:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
policy reasons why we support this
legislation

04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to just
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.279 --> 04:12:24.469 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
first and foremost the imperative
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
associated with trying to push out
 
04:12:30.790 --> 04:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
broadband to
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that are unserved and
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
can be a question about how the ultimate
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
number is arrived at the fcc
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
says that it's somewhere in the 97 98
 
04:12:44.560 --> 04:12:46.070 align:start position:0%
says that it's somewhere in the 97 98
range

04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
range
 
04:12:49.269 --> 04:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
challenges with the granularity of any
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
data especially when you're collecting
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
it at a statewide basis so
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
i i have long said and i think it to be
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
true that a more
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
realistic estimate is about 95 percent
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
um that said that fcc data is based on
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
census blocks not tracks blocks of
 
04:13:10.950 --> 04:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
course are the smaller of the two
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
geographic polygons but nonetheless
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're in that range at this point
 
04:13:19.110 --> 04:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
what makes this
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
legislation i think particularly useful
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
for broadband providers is that
 
04:13:24.870 --> 04:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
remaining five percent does not
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
constitute five percent of the land area
 
04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
in the state doesn't constitute five
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
percent of the miles that we're going to
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
have to wire
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
to serve those remaining people
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
in fact there are
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
i think by any reasonable estimate
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds perhaps a thousand
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
or more miles
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
of road
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
mostly public some private
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
that are going to need to be built to
 
04:13:49.110 --> 04:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
get that last five percent
 
04:13:49.120 --> 04:13:50.790 align:start position:0%
get that last five percent
and

04:13:50.790 --> 04:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
fixed costs like attacks are
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
particularly meaningful when broadband
 
04:13:56.550 --> 04:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
providers are trying to determine
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they can justify building
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
their network because
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
every year we have to account for that
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
cost and
 
04:14:08.309 --> 04:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
there are many cost variable capital
 
04:14:09.990 --> 04:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
fixed costs associated with broadband
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
networks we can't solve all of those
 
04:14:11.520 --> 04:14:12.790 align:start position:0%
networks we can't solve all of those
challenges

04:14:12.790 --> 04:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation seeks to
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
address one of them and just to give you
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
a sense of what that means
 
04:14:21.030 --> 04:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
a mile of infrastructure in a rural part
 
04:14:22.710 --> 04:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
of the state may have
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
four or five possible customers
 
04:14:29.349 --> 04:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
even the very best adoption programs
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh can only get to maybe a penetration
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
of 70
 
04:14:36.630 --> 04:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
you never get everyone for a host of
 
04:14:36.640 --> 04:14:37.910 align:start position:0%
you never get everyone for a host of
reasons

04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
to to subscribe
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
um that mile of infrastructure
 
04:14:44.790 --> 04:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
for us
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
has fixed costs that include
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
the rent that we pay to reside on the
 
04:14:49.680 --> 04:14:50.790 align:start position:0%
the rent that we pay to reside on the
polls

04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
polls
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
35 polls a mile
 
04:14:55.110 --> 04:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 10 and 15 dollars a
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
poll per year
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then the tax is associated with it
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not hard to see why
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
higher fixed costs make it very
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
difficult to justify expansion
 
04:15:08.469 --> 04:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
so that's our primary the primary policy
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
justification for taking a hard look at
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
this change
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:15:16.389 --> 04:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
issue this is specific of course the
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
cable industry is that we already fully
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
compensate municipalities for the use of
 
04:15:23.910 --> 04:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
there right away the federal government
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
provides a statutory framework that
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
requires us to give permission to
 
04:15:30.389 --> 04:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
operate in towns right away it's called
 
04:15:34.950 --> 04:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
a franchise in return for that franchise
 
04:15:34.960 --> 04:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
a franchise in return for that franchise
we

04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities can charge up to five
 
04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
percent of our gross video revenue as a
 
04:15:42.070 --> 04:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
franchise fee
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that constitutes an r
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
footprint a little over 13 million
 
04:15:50.469 --> 04:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
dollars a year and in many many
 
04:15:53.110 --> 04:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
situations that
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
federal construct which is applied
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
locally has been determined to fully
 
04:15:59.670 --> 04:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
compensate municipalities for the use of
 
04:16:01.110 --> 04:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
their right of way
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
and this
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
local this tax which is unique and i
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
want to just make sure that the
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee understands
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about an exemption for
 
04:16:13.110 --> 04:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
taxation on real property
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is a tax levied on the use and
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
occupation of our personal property in
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
the right of way it's our wire to
 
04:16:21.910 --> 04:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
network infrastructure that we're
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
talking about that's having a tax
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
applied to it
 
04:16:28.469 --> 04:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
and then new hampshire is nearly unique
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the united states in the use of
 
04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
attacks like this only california
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
taxes use and occupation of their rights
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
away and they tax the use and occupation
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
of real property in the right of way not
 
04:16:42.630 --> 04:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
personal property
 
04:16:42.640 --> 04:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
personal property
so

04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:46.149 --> 04:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that i've outlined in my
 
04:16:46.159 --> 04:16:47.429 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that i've outlined in my
testimony

04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:16:47.439 --> 04:16:48.389 align:start position:0%
testimony
and

04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony what i've described
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
here today before you
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
we we support this legislation it is not
 
04:16:58.950 --> 04:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is certainly obvious to
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
i think everyone on the committee and in
 
04:17:02.070 --> 04:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
the room
 
04:17:04.710 --> 04:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a panacea for
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
the states or any state's broadband
 
04:17:06.560 --> 04:17:07.590 align:start position:0%
the states or any state's broadband
problem

04:17:07.590 --> 04:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
a statutory change that will change the
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
calculus for how
 
04:17:16.710 --> 04:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
we have to account for our fixed costs
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
we've determined whether or not we can
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
deploy a network
 
04:17:23.110 --> 04:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of parts that go into that
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
but this would certainly uh help
 
04:17:27.990 --> 04:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time i understand
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
it's limited and i'd be happy to take
 
04:17:31.110 --> 04:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
enter any questions you may have yeah
 
04:17:32.950 --> 04:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'll start um
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
first i apologize for being late i had
 
04:17:34.560 --> 04:17:35.269 align:start position:0%
first i apologize for being late i had
to

04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:17:37.110 --> 04:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
introduce another bill
 
04:17:40.469 --> 04:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
can you just recapitulate for me this
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about as the right of way
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
and you say it's unique right away
 
04:17:44.870 --> 04:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
compared to other states can you just
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
embellish a little bit on that sure so
 
04:17:47.399 --> 04:17:49.269 align:start position:0%
embellish a little bit on that sure so
7223

04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
7223
 
04:17:49.279 --> 04:17:50.550 align:start position:0%
7223
describes

04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
describes
 
04:17:53.349 --> 04:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
how in a situation when there's a an
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
agreement or lease
 
04:17:55.439 --> 04:17:56.950 align:start position:0%
agreement or lease
to

04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
use that right away the tax the
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
municipality or the state
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
can levy attacks
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a fairly lengthy statute but
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's the the basis of it
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
um it's not 728 which is the part of the
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
statute that deals with real property
 
04:18:12.960 --> 04:18:14.309 align:start position:0%
statute that deals with real property
taxation

04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's for
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
an instance where
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
personal property or
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
real property is
 
04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
is occupying or using
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
land owned by the state or one of its
 
04:18:28.149 --> 04:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
and what it would do
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
similar to the way the
 
04:18:33.910 --> 04:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
exemption exists for leases relative to
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
state-owned railways
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
the language and the bill would
 
04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
essentially say that if you
 
04:18:39.439 --> 04:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
essentially say that if you
are

04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:18:42.630 --> 04:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
if you have personal property or
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
property in the right-of-way
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
that generates revenue for local
 
04:18:46.880 --> 04:18:48.550 align:start position:0%
that generates revenue for local
municipalities

04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
through some other provision of state
 
04:18:52.469 --> 04:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
law so perhaps it's 72 8 which is
 
04:18:54.630 --> 04:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
related to real property taxation it
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
could be 53 c which is the statute that
 
04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
relates to our franchise with to occupy
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
and use it right away which is the
 
04:19:06.630 --> 04:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
source of that 13 million dollars in
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
revenue that we collect and remit to
 
04:19:10.630 --> 04:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities that's that's what we're
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
04:19:14.790 --> 04:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay does that answer your question yes
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
and representative ames
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh the same same question that i asked
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
before do you have a number of what it
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
would cost to
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
make that last mile connection here in
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
i can't offer one
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
i can't offer a detailed estimate
 
04:19:46.710 --> 04:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
um we know
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're in the process now uh because of
 
04:19:49.760 --> 04:19:50.790 align:start position:0%
we're in the process now uh because of
uh

04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
the imperative created obviously by this
 
04:19:52.720 --> 04:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
the imperative created obviously by this
pandemic

04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
to to scope that out and it is it's a
 
04:20:01.510 --> 04:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
very substantial amount i mean if you
 
04:20:01.520 --> 04:20:02.790 align:start position:0%
very substantial amount i mean if you
consider

04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
consider
 
04:20:05.110 --> 04:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
average costs of
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
40 50
 
04:20:09.030 --> 04:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
plus thousand dollars a mile to deploy
 
04:20:09.040 --> 04:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
plus thousand dollars a mile to deploy
infrastructure

04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
a thousand
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
miles of road if if that is what it'll
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
take to push this out to the final five
 
04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
percent is in the tens of millions of
 
04:20:19.040 --> 04:20:20.309 align:start position:0%
percent is in the tens of millions of
dollars

04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a large undertaking which
 
04:20:22.960 --> 04:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a large undertaking which
is

04:20:23.590 --> 04:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
frankly why it hasn't been taken to date
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's very expensive to do it when there
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
are very few if any customers to
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:20:40.960 --> 04:20:42.229 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
um

04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:44.790 --> 04:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
so i actually have two questions uh
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
first is uh
 
04:20:49.750 --> 04:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
is related to
 
04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
04:20:57.429 --> 04:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
the question is whether some of those
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
last miles
 
04:21:01.199 --> 04:21:02.309 align:start position:0%
last miles
are

04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:21:02.319 --> 04:21:03.910 align:start position:0%
are
concentrated

04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
concentrated
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
in some parts or some municipalities
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
or is it more or less evenly spread
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.910 --> 04:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
so based on what i've seen in the
 
04:21:21.030 --> 04:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
analysis we've done there's
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
a modest range
 
04:21:23.279 --> 04:21:25.830 align:start position:0%
a modest range
between

04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
less than half a dozen homes a mile to
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
less than 10 homes a mile in these areas
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
that are unserved
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't need to
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
tell you the history of how new
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire developed but by and large we
 
04:21:40.000 --> 04:21:41.030 align:start position:0%
hampshire developed but by and large we
developed

04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
developed
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
as a series of
 
04:21:45.429 --> 04:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
village centers centered around some
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
sort of industry typically a water
 
04:21:49.830 --> 04:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
supply of some sort had to be part of
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
that and as a consequence
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
there are pockets of relatively high
 
04:21:54.880 --> 04:21:56.070 align:start position:0%
there are pockets of relatively high
density

04:21:56.070 --> 04:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
density
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
and then many areas of very low density
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
and even
 
04:22:01.830 --> 04:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
a few hundred years after that initial
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
development that holds true in many
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
parts of the state we see
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
village centers with 100 150 200
 
04:22:11.750 --> 04:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
locations that are serviceable which is
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
how we think about it homes businesses
 
04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
government facilities and then
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
long stretches
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
where there's
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
very little development
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
and then there are other
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
issues that interrelate with that land
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
use considerations how we've chosen to
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
develop with larger lots
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
buildings are set back from roads these
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
things all contribute to
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
the challenges we experience when we
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
do you have maps or data that might
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
be in sufficient summary form that would
 
04:22:51.030 --> 04:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
enable us to look at that question of
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
differential impact so i will uh i will
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
send to the entire committee a link to
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
the most recent
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
federal mapping data which is
 
04:23:05.349 --> 04:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
a work in progress
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
but it's going to give you the most
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
complete view of what we're looking at
 
04:23:11.670 --> 04:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the state okay that would be helpful
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
then i have a follow-up question
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:17.359 --> 04:23:18.389 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
this is the question
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
as i understand it
 
04:23:23.279 --> 04:23:24.229 align:start position:0%
as i understand it
this

04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:24.239 --> 04:23:26.309 align:start position:0%
this
exemption

04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
would apply to two categories i would
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
identify one would be
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
existing personal property out there
 
04:23:34.960 --> 04:23:35.830 align:start position:0%
existing personal property out there
that's

04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
now subject to the tax
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the other would be
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
to be developed last mile whatever you
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
want to call it
 
04:23:45.040 --> 04:23:47.510 align:start position:0%
want to call it
property

04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
and we've heard from the previous
 
04:23:50.800 --> 04:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
and we've heard from the previous
uh

04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:51.840 --> 04:23:53.590 align:start position:0%
uh
testimony

04:23:53.590 --> 04:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:23:53.600 --> 04:23:55.510 align:start position:0%
testimony
that

04:23:55.510 --> 04:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for this bill is a
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
tax cut
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
bill and that the tax cut the savings
 
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
would be about
 
04:24:06.309 --> 04:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
between two and three million dollars
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's what i remember
 
04:24:07.840 --> 04:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
that's what i remember
and

04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:09.600 --> 04:24:10.630 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know what part of that
 
04:24:17.110 --> 04:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
if you can help us on this uh
 
04:24:17.120 --> 04:24:18.710 align:start position:0%
if you can help us on this uh
is

04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
taxes that are now being paid
 
04:24:21.840 --> 04:24:23.750 align:start position:0%
taxes that are now being paid
versus

04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
versus
 
04:24:25.830 --> 04:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
taxes that might be paid if you manage
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
to pull this off and
 
04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
go further down that last mile
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
so if i understand your question
 
04:24:32.399 --> 04:24:33.990 align:start position:0%
so if i understand your question
correctly

04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
i'll answer it this way so
 
04:24:36.560 --> 04:24:39.110 align:start position:0%
i'll answer it this way so
the

04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
half a million or so homes that we serve
 
04:24:43.750 --> 04:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
right now in the state
 
04:24:46.389 --> 04:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
not all our customers but we in 112
 
04:24:49.349 --> 04:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
communities we serve we pass about 100
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
about 500 000 locations
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
all of them through a wired network so
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
all of
 
04:24:58.469 --> 04:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
that right away is subject to
 
04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
the areas that we don't serve we haven't
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
built infrastructure in not right away
 
04:25:11.110 --> 04:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
we're not the only provider that's
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
seeking to accomplish this work we're
 
04:25:16.710 --> 04:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
not gonna i'm sorry i said we're not the
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
only provider seeking to solve this
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
problem there are
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
providers who have network
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the right of way
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
traditional telephone companies
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
whose network infrastructure does not
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
provide broadband service so there they
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
are already occupying it with their
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's being utilized for
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
phone or
 
04:25:40.950 --> 04:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
services that aren't
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily considered broadband speeds
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
so that would
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
they would already be paying
 
04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
use and occupation tax on it
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
already so
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
and one of the if you look at my
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
testimony one of the
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
rationales behind this addressing this
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
issue is that not all providers are
 
04:26:03.510 --> 04:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
being treated the same
 
04:26:06.070 --> 04:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's a supreme court case in 2017
 
04:26:06.080 --> 04:26:07.269 align:start position:0%
there's a supreme court case in 2017
where

04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
another type of provider
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
what's known as a clek
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
sued the city of nashua over whether or
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
not that was this application of the tax
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
to them was lawful and the court said no
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
because unlike us or a phone company
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
that type of provider doesn't have an
 
04:26:27.429 --> 04:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
agreement or license from the city so no
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
license to be there
 
04:26:30.720 --> 04:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
license to be there
no

04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
nexus that allows the taxation
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
the net result of that is that provider
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
who's sitting on exactly the same polls
 
04:26:41.429 --> 04:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
running wires a foot or uh above us or
 
04:26:46.630 --> 04:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
below us is not paying this tax and we
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
are so there's a
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know to the extent there's a desire
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
to have competitive equity among like
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
providers this is a real challenge with
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
this statute and that's one of the
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
rationales for for fixing it
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
good question about a fiscal note is
 
04:27:05.279 --> 04:27:06.790 align:start position:0%
good question about a fiscal note is
there

04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see one here is there do you
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
know anything about that because
 
04:27:13.110 --> 04:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
we clearly would be helped by
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
some analysis of this question all right
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure we'll take a look at
 
04:27:16.239 --> 04:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure we'll take a look at
that

04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
well first my prior
 
04:27:34.479 --> 04:27:36.630 align:start position:0%
well first my prior
question

04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
which was
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
whether we were using census tracts or
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
surveys to get to the 95 percent it
 
04:27:50.070 --> 04:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
sounded like you said census tracts
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh no census blocks so yes center sparks
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
so census tracts are
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
areas that have perhaps two to three
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
thousand locations in them census blocks
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
of which there are roughly 70 thousand
 
04:28:07.110 --> 04:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire have
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
15 to 18
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
locations in them so it's far far more
 
04:28:12.159 --> 04:28:14.710 align:start position:0%
locations in them so it's far far more
granular

04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
granular
 
04:28:14.720 --> 04:28:16.870 align:start position:0%
granular
the

04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
the fcc is going through a transition
 
04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
away from census blocks to
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
um what are known as like polygon maps
 
04:28:27.189 --> 04:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
right so
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
the map boundaries the serviceability
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
boundaries will be defined not by a
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
somewhat arbitrary
 
04:28:37.030 --> 04:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
shape which is a census block
 
04:28:38.870 --> 04:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
set by a government agency doesn't
 
04:28:40.229 --> 04:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
relate to
 
04:28:43.750 --> 04:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
telecom network footprint at all
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
to data collection that is more based on
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
the physical ability of these networks
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
to reach a certain location
 
04:28:52.000 --> 04:28:53.590 align:start position:0%
to reach a certain location
and

04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
because of that they're going to be more
 
04:28:55.760 --> 04:28:56.870 align:start position:0%
because of that they're going to be more
accurate

04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's going on right now
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
at the fcc it was a function of
 
04:29:01.760 --> 04:29:02.950 align:start position:0%
at the fcc it was a function of
first

04:29:02.950 --> 04:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:29:05.110 --> 04:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
dollars appropriated through cares
 
04:29:08.070 --> 04:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then more recently
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
either through infrastructure or arpa i
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
don't recall which of the two
 
04:29:14.790 --> 04:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
bills funded that effort but it's it's
 
04:29:14.800 --> 04:29:16.149 align:start position:0%
bills funded that effort but it's it's
appropriated

04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
04:29:18.309 --> 04:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
we know what the pathway is to these
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
maps and uh
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's going on right now so but it's
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
census blocks which are
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
smaller geographic areas
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you if i could have a follow-up
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
04:29:30.560 --> 04:29:32.229 align:start position:0%
yes please
on

04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:29:32.239 --> 04:29:33.429 align:start position:0%
on
that

04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know how they'd do a census
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
block in my small complex which is 22
 
04:29:38.239 --> 04:29:39.670 align:start position:0%
block in my small complex which is 22
units

04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
units
 
04:29:39.680 --> 04:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
units
but

04:29:41.910 --> 04:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:29:43.510 --> 04:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
they um
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
that won't be ready i guess for a few
 
04:29:45.680 --> 04:29:46.550 align:start position:0%
that won't be ready i guess for a few
years

04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
so we won't
 
04:29:48.800 --> 04:29:49.510 align:start position:0%
so we won't
the

04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the problem is there are two problems
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
here one of them is getting the cable
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
there and the other one is the people in
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
a house being able to afford to pay your
 
04:29:58.319 --> 04:29:59.429 align:start position:0%
a house being able to afford to pay your
prices

04:29:59.429 --> 04:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
prices
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
which i am a comcast customer
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
i haven't managed to get it down below
 
04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
what i was paying in new york city for a
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
single apartment 40 years ago
 
04:30:09.840 --> 04:30:12.149 align:start position:0%
single apartment 40 years ago
yet

04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:12.159 --> 04:30:13.349 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:30:13.359 --> 04:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
but
uh

04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:15.600 --> 04:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
uh
the

04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:30:18.319 --> 04:30:19.429 align:start position:0%
the question
that

04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
i've got is where
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
if this was passed and you had
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
two and a half to three million dollars
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
a year more of taxpayer money that came
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
from the municipalities which is our
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:37.520 --> 04:30:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
to

04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
to work with
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
would your priorities be
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
be actually trying to do the
 
04:30:50.550 --> 04:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
least cost efficient
 
04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
part of your work which is getting out
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
that last mile or
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
04:31:02.469 --> 04:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
prove the service on your menus for
 
04:31:02.479 --> 04:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
prove the service on your menus for
instance

04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
instance
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
so a couple points one we would not be
 
04:31:15.030 --> 04:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
difference between what's taxed now and
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
what's what the future would hold we're
 
04:31:23.030 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
we would receive a far smaller less than
 
04:31:27.510 --> 04:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
our so you know we extend the network to
 
04:31:32.550 --> 04:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
areas that we haven't otherwise served
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
every day we extended it to 4
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
200 or so
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
brand new locations in 21
 
04:31:41.439 --> 04:31:42.630 align:start position:0%
brand new locations in 21
that's

04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
a little bit less than our typical
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
for many obvious reasons but that's it's
 
04:31:50.950 --> 04:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
always an imperative to try to figure
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
out where you can what new customers you
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
can reach
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
and that 4200 does not include
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
a major build in laconia and guilford
 
04:32:01.110 --> 04:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
which is 13 plus thousand locations
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh extensions beyond where we already
 
04:32:07.590 --> 04:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
are in the other hundred and ten or so
 
04:32:07.600 --> 04:32:08.630 align:start position:0%
are in the other hundred and ten or so
towns

04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:32:11.349 --> 04:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
um including i'm sure every town that
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
that you all represent
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh so it's
 
04:32:17.349 --> 04:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
it would
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
design projects
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that we just currently can't do
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of taking into account our
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
fixed cost
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
that's the best way to describe it it's
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
impossible to point to
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know a particular project or stretch
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
of road that would now be feasible that
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
isn't or would
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
would be feasible and now isn't i should
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
say but
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
it is it's part of that puzzle and when
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
that formula here
 
04:32:58.149 --> 04:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
relative to other places this is one of
 
04:33:00.309 --> 04:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
all but a small piece
 
04:33:02.070 --> 04:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the puzzle that's different here that
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to account for
 
04:33:03.600 --> 04:33:10.551 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to account for
elsewhere

04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.561 --> 04:33:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
representative lange
 
04:33:15.189 --> 04:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and and my question is around
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
the same conversation you said wherever
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
i said it's all me thank you for taking
 
04:33:19.429 --> 04:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
my question thank you mr chair
 
04:33:19.439 --> 04:33:20.551 align:start position:0%
my question thank you mr chair
so

04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
in my past life i was actually director
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
for hampshire electric car but one of
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
the important things i learned is that
 
04:33:27.910 --> 04:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
up in north country they average seven
 
04:33:29.910 --> 04:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
subscribers per mile as compared to
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
manchester united as 70 subscribers per
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
mile so you can understand the business
 
04:33:34.080 --> 04:33:34.869 align:start position:0%
mile so you can understand the business
model

04:33:34.869 --> 04:33:34.879 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
challenges of extending out that extra
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
mile for seven subscribers and how
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to get the return on that
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question is if we're
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
if to represent almi's point is there
 
04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
going to be a relationship between the
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
tax break we give you and the expansion
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the program and i mean i think that's
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
a huge you know the talking point for
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
what we're here is we're going to give
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
you a tax break and the idea is to
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
expand the program is that i don't want
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
to come back next year and see 4 200 you
 
04:34:01.429 --> 04:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
know the same expansion rate that you
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
were doing before and we gave you a 2.3
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
million tax break over across the whole
 
04:34:06.789 --> 04:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
state so my question is what's the
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
correlational relationship between the
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
tax break and the expansion of the
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
network and is there any commitment to
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely a correlation between
 
04:34:21.680 --> 04:34:23.429 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely a correlation between
our

04:34:23.429 --> 04:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:34:27.269 --> 04:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
cost analysis for a project the reality
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
of that project that you described and
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can do it
 
04:34:31.119 --> 04:34:32.949 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can do it
absolutely

04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
this is by no means
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
the largest input into that formula it's
 
04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
just not we're talking about
 
04:34:42.070 --> 04:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps two and a half three million
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
dollars over a very large
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
geographic area relatively speaking so i
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to i don't want to oversell
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
it as as a solution to our challenges
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's it is part of the solution
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
a fixed cost that we have to account for
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
here and factor in that we wouldn't we
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
don't otherwise
 
04:35:08.551 --> 04:35:08.561 align:start position:0%
and that has an impact uh it's it's just
 
04:35:08.561 --> 04:35:10.949 align:start position:0%
and that has an impact uh it's it's just
simply

04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.349 --> 04:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
given the scale of the solution
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
that's represented by this piece of
 
04:35:14.719 --> 04:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
that's represented by this piece of
legislation

04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's probably not possible to show you
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
the discrete areas of the state that all
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
of a sudden become economically feasible
 
04:35:24.320 --> 04:35:25.109 align:start position:0%
of a sudden become economically feasible
it's

04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
i'd love to be able to do it if the
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
numbers were bigger it'd be easier to do
 
04:35:28.879 --> 04:35:29.590 align:start position:0%
numbers were bigger it'd be easier to do
it

04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't make them less
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
meaningful they're just not
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
they're just not as big
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:40.869 --> 04:35:40.879 align:start position:0%
representative schaumburg
 
04:35:42.629 --> 04:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:35:44.320 --> 04:35:46.150 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
did comcast
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
not yet
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
we we received from the state of new
 
04:35:55.119 --> 04:35:56.390 align:start position:0%
we we received from the state of new
hampshire

04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
and to help build out three locations
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
in canaan loudon and hinsdale the summer
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
of 2020.
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
that was new hampshire's connecting
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:36:11.189 --> 04:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
broadband program it was a cares act
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
funded program
 
04:36:12.480 --> 04:36:13.590 align:start position:0%
funded program
those

04:36:13.590 --> 04:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
three projects constituted just under
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
100 homes
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
in those three towns
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
awaiting the release of the state's arpa
 
04:36:24.240 --> 04:36:25.429 align:start position:0%
awaiting the release of the state's arpa
funded

04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
funded
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
program you may recall that last year
 
04:36:29.670 --> 04:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature created a broadband
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
match and grant program it's housed at
 
04:36:31.680 --> 04:36:33.670 align:start position:0%
match and grant program it's housed at
bea

04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
bea
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
we are we're waiting to see
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
the source of the funds to to make that
 
04:36:38.561 --> 04:36:39.510 align:start position:0%
the source of the funds to to make that
program

04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
work will be arpa the capital projects
 
04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
fund money so we're waiting to see what
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
that looks like
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that we can
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just quick follow
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
how much money did you receive on the
 
04:36:53.429 --> 04:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:36:55.039 --> 04:36:56.470 align:start position:0%
it was
estimated

04:36:56.470 --> 04:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges was it had to be
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
100 done by december 15th
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's a program that got announced in
 
04:37:09.520 --> 04:37:10.629 align:start position:0%
there's a program that got announced in
august

04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
august
 
04:37:11.910 --> 04:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
i would have liked to have done a lot
 
04:37:14.230 --> 04:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
more but it was not possible at that
 
04:37:14.240 --> 04:37:16.789 align:start position:0%
more but it was not possible at that
point

04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:37:20.949 --> 04:37:20.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my next question
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
here and it has to do with uh
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
specifics on the money
 
04:37:25.039 --> 04:37:25.910 align:start position:0%
specifics on the money
and

04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:28.709 --> 04:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
i apologize if this is um
 
04:37:28.719 --> 04:37:29.590 align:start position:0%
i apologize if this is um
maybe

04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
an unfair question but i
 
04:37:33.029 --> 04:37:33.039 align:start position:0%
i want to i want to understand that the
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
two and a half million that could be
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
saved by the uh
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
by eliminating this tax
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
that is then if i
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
that is then split
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
among the various providers so they
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't all
 
04:37:48.719 --> 04:37:50.310 align:start position:0%
wouldn't all
be

04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
captured by comcast absolutely right
 
04:37:53.840 --> 04:37:56.551 align:start position:0%
captured by comcast absolutely right
follow-up

04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
in your estimation what percentage of
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
that money would go to comcast less than
 
04:38:01.039 --> 04:38:02.709 align:start position:0%
that money would go to comcast less than
20

04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
20
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:09.269 --> 04:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions and that's just
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's based on what we know to be our
 
04:38:14.230 --> 04:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
tax bills now it's yeah
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know the two and a half to three and
 
04:38:21.429 --> 04:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
a half million is very much an estimate
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's purely an estimate based on what we
 
04:38:26.551 --> 04:38:26.561 align:start position:0%
know the size of our network to be what
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
we know our current tax bill to be and
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
what we believe to be
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
the presence of other providers networks
 
04:38:35.590 --> 04:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's very much an effort at
 
04:38:35.600 --> 04:38:39.029 align:start position:0%
it's it's very much an effort at
ballparking

04:38:39.029 --> 04:38:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
um let me ask you
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
is your network all fiber
 
04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
the backbone of its fiber it's a hybrid
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
network the back one is 100
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
yes fiber
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
the network architecture is
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
fiber to the node the node is a
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
electronic device within
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
a few hundred feet of a customer's home
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
that transfers light
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
spectrum into rf
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
rf travels over
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
coaxial cable right the last few hundred
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
feet it's
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
what would i remember there was a bill
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
years ago about about this and what is
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
it per mile to to pull at that cable
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
well up to
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's no so aerial deployment
 
04:39:27.510 --> 04:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
obviously underground is dramatically
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
more expensive aerial deployment
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.600 --> 04:39:34.709 align:start position:0%
 
50

04:39:34.709 --> 04:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
50
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
000 plus in the variable variability
 
04:39:38.948 --> 04:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:39:38.958 --> 04:39:39.990 align:start position:0%
might be
20

04:39:39.990 --> 04:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
20
 
04:39:42.390 --> 04:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
25 that's based on
 
04:39:44.470 --> 04:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
make ready you know what it takes us to
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
make the polls
 
04:39:49.270 --> 04:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
sound for our arrival on them our
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
attachment to them there's
 
04:39:52.948 --> 04:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
but you you least
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't put polls in
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's really that you you're in
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
space on the on telephone poles or
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
electric poles the vast majority of our
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
network is attached to poles owned by
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
some combination of an electric company
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
and a phone company
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
we do set
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
infrequently but when we need to we set
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
our own polls typically our goal there
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
is to turn an ownership over to the
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
incumbent electric or phone provider app
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
right after we do it
 
04:40:27.030 --> 04:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
they're in the business of poll
 
04:40:28.550 --> 04:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance we're
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're not we're in the business of
 
04:40:32.550 --> 04:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
paying them to be on their polls so
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
last question that
 
04:40:34.160 --> 04:40:34.948 align:start position:0%
last question that
so

04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
taxing that's going on it affects cable
 
04:40:41.190 --> 04:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
companies but i would assume telephone
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
companies does it impact the electric
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
companies as well does not just the
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
telecoms and the uh
 
04:40:52.390 --> 04:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:40:56.550 --> 04:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
when you wire a community
 
04:40:58.868 --> 04:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
are you aware of uh
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
or can you quantify the impact on
 
04:41:01.120 --> 04:41:02.150 align:start position:0%
or can you quantify the impact on
housing

04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:41:03.990 --> 04:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
on property values
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
where i'm going with this is
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
the gross number is two two and a half
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
million of revenue that will be foregone
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
but if it increases property values some
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
of that can be recaptured in property
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
taxes yeah i i have seen a lot of um
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
rhetorical and anecdotal commentary on
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
that i've never we've never been the
 
04:41:28.390 --> 04:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
source of an analysis of that but you
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
routinely see real estate agents
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
say that it can impact the property
 
04:41:37.590 --> 04:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
value by you know 10 or more 20
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
i have i do not know the source of that
 
04:41:40.320 --> 04:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
i have i do not know the source of that
data

04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
data
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
but you routinely hear that from folks
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
that are experts in the housing industry
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how that's viewed
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of assessment methodology by
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
very frequently hear that as a
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
result of broadband deployments
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
okay i appreciate the response thank you
 
04:42:06.390 --> 04:42:06.400 align:start position:0%

04:43:42.628 --> 04:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me we testify in support of this
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
bill today because we believe
 
04:43:46.628 --> 04:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
it encourages investment in broadband
 
04:43:46.638 --> 04:43:48.070 align:start position:0%
it encourages investment in broadband
infrastructure

04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:43:50.948 --> 04:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
and deployment in a competitively
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
neutral way
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation creates tax equity
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh you heard from mr hodgin about
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
franchise fees our members in new
 
04:44:04.150 --> 04:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire collectively
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
pay franchise fees to municipalities
 
04:44:06.400 --> 04:44:07.430 align:start position:0%
pay franchise fees to municipalities
totaling

04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
totaling
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 16 million annually
 
04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
reducing tax burdens on providers in an
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
equitable manner will encourage
 
04:44:19.350 --> 04:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
the reallocation of dollars toward
 
04:44:19.360 --> 04:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
the reallocation of dollars toward
deployment

04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
deployment
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
again as you heard from mr hodgson
 
04:44:26.310 --> 04:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to take a few moments today
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
to share with you a little bit of
 
04:44:28.080 --> 04:44:29.030 align:start position:0%
to share with you a little bit of
history

04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
history
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
about telecommunications taxation in new
 
04:44:31.040 --> 04:44:31.990 align:start position:0%
about telecommunications taxation in new
hampshire

04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:44:33.990 --> 04:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
i think it provides a really valuable
 
04:44:34.000 --> 04:44:35.270 align:start position:0%
i think it provides a really valuable
context

04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
context
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
as you evaluate the merits of what's in
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
front of you today
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that the tax
 
04:44:42.878 --> 04:44:44.070 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that the tax
environment

04:44:44.070 --> 04:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has
 
04:44:46.320 --> 04:44:47.830 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has
evolved

04:44:47.830 --> 04:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
evolved
 
04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
into an environment that is not
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily conducive
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
to incentivizing broadband deployment at
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
this point or as in we're not as
 
04:44:58.948 --> 04:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
incentivizing as it could be i should
 
04:44:58.958 --> 04:45:00.310 align:start position:0%
incentivizing as it could be i should
say

04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to the 70s
 
04:45:02.638 --> 04:45:03.590 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to the 70s
um

04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to make this brief but
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
beginning in the 70s landline
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
companies landline telephone companies
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
paid a statewide tax on personal
 
04:45:12.480 --> 04:45:13.590 align:start position:0%
paid a statewide tax on personal
property

04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
such as polls and conduits that was
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
because the telecommunications
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
industry was evolving and you had
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
wireless entrance etc
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
in 1990
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
the cst was created
 
04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
and the state decided to no longer tax
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
those polls and conduits as personal
 
04:45:36.480 --> 04:45:37.750 align:start position:0%
those polls and conduits as personal
property

04:45:37.750 --> 04:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
but rather
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
impose a more equitable tax structure on
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
the service to be provided
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
through the cst
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
that tax policy correctly
 
04:45:51.590 --> 04:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
awarded picking winners and losers
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
based upon technology in a competitive
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
and emerging industry
 
04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
between 1990 and 1998
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
after that statewide property tax had
 
04:46:06.750 --> 04:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
been repealed and the cst was enacted
 
04:46:09.590 --> 04:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities stepped in
 
04:46:11.350 --> 04:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
and started taxing the telephone
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
company's personal property
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
the companies filed abatements they won
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
and courts held
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
that the munis could not tax they did
 
04:46:24.390 --> 04:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
not have the authority to tax personal
 
04:46:24.400 --> 04:46:26.550 align:start position:0%
not have the authority to tax personal
property

04:46:26.550 --> 04:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
then the electric companies
 
04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
filed abatements on the theory that
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
their polls were unfairly taxed
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
in order to settle the claims
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
in 2007
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 73 was enacted and that
 
04:46:42.000 --> 04:46:43.990 align:start position:0%
senate bill 73 was enacted and that
reclassified

04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
reclassified
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
the polls and conduits
 
04:46:49.270 --> 04:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
as real property no longer personal
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
property but now real property
 
04:46:55.110 --> 04:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
and at the same time there was imposed
 
04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
an exemption from the real estate tax
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
so it was a reclassification
 
04:47:02.948 --> 04:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
and an exemption imposed and now is a
 
04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
court sanctioned solution
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
to that to those electric abatement
 
04:47:07.360 --> 04:47:09.430 align:start position:0%
to that to those electric abatement
filings

04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
filings
 
04:47:11.910 --> 04:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
that exemption on property taxation
 
04:47:13.830 --> 04:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
was an integral part of new hampshire's
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
overall tax policy
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature and upheld by
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
and for many years it was viewed as
 
04:47:25.350 --> 04:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
equitable and fair
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
competitively neutral
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
in 1996
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
um the muni's realized well
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
we can't tax the polls and conduit as
 
04:47:39.510 --> 04:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
real property or personal property
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
so we're going to get a little creative
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to amend the poll
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
license the the licenses
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh for the rights of way to include
 
04:47:48.878 --> 04:47:50.150 align:start position:0%
uh for the rights of way to include
language

04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
from 72 23
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
which would require the payment of taxes
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
for the use and occupation of the
 
04:47:57.990 --> 04:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
right-of-way so it's sort of like well
 
04:47:59.830 --> 04:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
if it's not one tax or another tax it's
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to be this other tax
 
04:48:01.760 --> 04:48:03.110 align:start position:0%
going to be this other tax
and

04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:04.470 --> 04:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
the practice
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
of including that language
 
04:48:09.430 --> 04:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the leases
 
04:48:11.110 --> 04:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
has continued
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
and we will tell you that
 
04:48:15.430 --> 04:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
many know
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
though not all municipalities have
 
04:48:21.830 --> 04:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
in 2010 interestingly
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
the legislature refused to pass house
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill 492
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
which would have
 
04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
extended that exemption
 
04:48:34.470 --> 04:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh from real property taxation on polls
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
and conduits that had been created in
 
04:48:36.958 --> 04:48:38.948 align:start position:0%
and conduits that had been created in
2007.

04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
2007.
 
04:48:40.868 --> 04:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
so as of 2010
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
you had municipalities now taking
 
04:48:42.878 --> 04:48:44.470 align:start position:0%
you had municipalities now taking
advantage

04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the use and occupation tax
 
04:48:49.830 --> 04:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
and now also have the ability
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
to tax
 
04:48:54.390 --> 04:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
structures polls and conduit
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
in 2017
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
as as mr hodgson referenced
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
there was a case brought to the state
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
and in that case
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
it was recognized that not all
 
04:49:11.760 --> 04:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
it was recognized that not all
competitors

04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
competitors
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
had licenses to use the
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
right-of-way and rather could deploy
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
through poll attachment agreements
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
so this evolution of tax policy has sort
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
of led to a cumulative effect of more
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
taxes being imposed
 
04:49:30.628 --> 04:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
upon entities deploying in the rights of
 
04:49:30.638 --> 04:49:31.590 align:start position:0%
upon entities deploying in the rights of
way

04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:49:32.550 --> 04:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
and in
 
04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
and in inequity
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
among those competitive players
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
and i share all of that history with you
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
because i think it provides a good
 
04:49:41.280 --> 04:49:42.390 align:start position:0%
because i think it provides a good
context

04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
context
 
04:49:44.550 --> 04:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
we can look at this as a tax break or
 
04:49:45.750 --> 04:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
tax cut
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
or we can look at it as re-establishing
 
04:49:49.750 --> 04:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
tax equity
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
among competitive players in the
 
04:49:51.200 --> 04:49:53.350 align:start position:0%
among competitive players in the
industry

04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:49:56.788 --> 04:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
so just as a reminder the cst is imposed
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
on telecommunications services
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
under 82 a
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
structures polls and conduits are taxed
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
as real property
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 72 8a
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
franchise fees as has been discussed
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
or paid to municipalities pursuant to
 
04:50:13.200 --> 04:50:15.430 align:start position:0%
or paid to municipalities pursuant to
53c

04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
53c
 
04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
and companies with infrastructure within
 
04:50:19.830 --> 04:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
the rights of way
 
04:50:22.230 --> 04:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
are taxed for use in occupation
 
04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
under 72 23.
 
04:50:27.670 --> 04:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
so based on this history
 
04:50:29.110 --> 04:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
we see that there has traditionally been
 
04:50:30.868 --> 04:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
a desire to treat all competitive
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
technologies fairly and with a level
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
playing field
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
and we believe that this bill is
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
consistent with that and so we ask for
 
04:50:40.070 --> 04:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
your support
 
04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer questions to the
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
extent i can
 
04:50:43.520 --> 04:50:44.708 align:start position:0%
extent i can
okay

04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:44.718 --> 04:50:46.788 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:50:49.110 --> 04:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:50:51.040 --> 04:50:51.830 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
uh

04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
being the chair of my local bos
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i see the effective date is july 1st
 
04:50:57.520 --> 04:50:59.590 align:start position:0%
and i see the effective date is july 1st
2022

04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
2022
 
04:50:59.600 --> 04:51:00.390 align:start position:0%
2022
uh

04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
will this exemption affect
 
04:51:04.150 --> 04:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
the budgets
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
of my town or the other towns that are
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to i'm sorry you may
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
not be able to answer that i should have
 
04:51:16.150 --> 04:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
asked the expert
 
04:51:18.628 --> 04:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
i haven't done the math on that and and
 
04:51:20.788 --> 04:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what the budget cycle is
 
04:51:20.798 --> 04:51:21.830 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what the budget cycle is
or

04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:51:23.190 --> 04:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
how that would
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
intersect with the effective date but i
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
think you know that's a conversation
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
worth having and i think the overall
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
goal here is smart equitable tax policy
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we're going to need
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
by the way this was a great presentation
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate it thank you i'm
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
sure it took a lot of work
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
i hate to admit that i'm old enough to
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
remember much of it
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
so um on the second page of your
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
a printed testimony there's four bullets
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
and the fourth bullet is i think what
 
04:52:12.070 --> 04:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
04:52:12.080 --> 04:52:13.750 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
here

04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:52:13.760 --> 04:52:15.270 align:start position:0%
here
um

04:52:15.270 --> 04:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:17.510 --> 04:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
so it gets back to an early a question i
 
04:52:20.150 --> 04:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
asked earlier a previous
 
04:52:20.160 --> 04:52:22.390 align:start position:0%
asked earlier a previous
testifier

04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
testifier
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
i'm in search of information
 
04:52:29.190 --> 04:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
you say companies
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
are taxed for the use and occupation of
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
those rights of way
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
and what i want to know is
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
what those taxes are and who's paying
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
and what municipalities are
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
receiving them
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether you're the
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the best position to provide that
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
information i don't know who is but
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
we um
 
04:52:54.868 --> 04:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
our industry within new hampshire the
 
04:52:57.430 --> 04:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
cable industry we estimate that we're
 
04:52:57.440 --> 04:52:58.390 align:start position:0%
cable industry we estimate that we're
paying

04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
paying
 
04:52:58.400 --> 04:52:59.430 align:start position:0%
paying
somewhere

04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
04:53:01.750 --> 04:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
over around a million
 
04:53:01.760 --> 04:53:03.030 align:start position:0%
over around a million
annually

04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
annually
 
04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
for use in occupation
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
again that's just our industry and again
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
there's some inconsistency where some
 
04:53:12.550 --> 04:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities have amended their
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
licenses to authorize this and others
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
haven't so
 
04:53:18.788 --> 04:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunately as precise as i can
 
04:53:18.798 --> 04:53:20.150 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunately as precise as i can
be

04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:53:22.550 --> 04:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
but we can you know dig a little deeper
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
and help to shine a little bit more
 
04:53:24.160 --> 04:53:27.750 align:start position:0%
and help to shine a little bit more
light

04:53:27.750 --> 04:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
anything you can provide would be most
 
04:53:29.840 --> 04:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
anything you can provide would be most
appreciated

04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
04:53:31.920 --> 04:53:32.788 align:start position:0%
appreciated
okay

04:53:32.788 --> 04:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:32.798 --> 04:53:34.708 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:36.550 --> 04:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
would you agree with mr hodgson that it
 
04:53:40.708 --> 04:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh thousands
 
04:53:46.390 --> 04:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
more miles
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
of of this to reach
 
04:53:49.680 --> 04:53:50.628 align:start position:0%
of of this to reach
uh

04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:53:52.470 --> 04:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
the remaining part of
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
the five percent that isn't served in
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:53:57.510 --> 04:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes i would i would agree and i would
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
echo that because again our association
 
04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
is not just comcast but atlantic
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
broadband and charter who do
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
serve more of the rural parts of the
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.310 --> 04:54:12.320 align:start position:0%

llc it's a firm that specializes
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the assessment of utility and special
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
use properties
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
and whose many
 
04:55:06.310 --> 04:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
local government and county
 
04:55:09.350 --> 04:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
clients will be adversely affected
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
by this bill
 
04:55:15.270 --> 04:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
i provided a list of the estimated
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
impact of the bill
 
04:55:22.230 --> 04:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
to our clients and you'll see that
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think there are 62
 
04:55:27.280 --> 04:55:28.390 align:start position:0%
i think there are 62

04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
the total impact
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
from our our database is just under 20
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
million uh evaluation so it's 20 million
 
04:55:44.550 --> 04:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
dollars of valuation to those
 
04:55:44.560 --> 04:55:47.110 align:start position:0%
dollars of valuation to those
62

towns

04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:55:50.788 --> 04:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
and obviously these are your constituent
 
04:55:50.798 --> 04:55:54.070 align:start position:0%
and obviously these are your constituent
towns

04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:55.830 --> 04:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
a tax exemption on cable and
 
04:55:55.840 --> 04:55:58.150 align:start position:0%
a tax exemption on cable and
telecommunications

04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
telecommunications
 
04:56:00.628 --> 04:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
we feel is a subsidy that's paid for by
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
other taxpayers
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
so that two to three million dollars
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's being talked about um
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think i think we all realize that a
 
04:56:12.550 --> 04:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
tax cut is a tax shift there's a fixed
 
04:56:15.750 --> 04:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
pie if you will and a municipal budget
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
and if that revenue comes out
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
on one side of the pie it's got to go in
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
on the other side
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
usually that is made up by the other
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or is essentially always made
 
04:56:31.750 --> 04:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
so you know given that we don't believe
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
that there's a reasonable basis for
 
04:56:36.320 --> 04:56:37.510 align:start position:0%
that there's a reasonable basis for
exempting

04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
exempting
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
these companies particularly when
 
04:56:41.590 --> 04:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's adequate competition
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'd also point out that
 
04:56:50.070 --> 04:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
the public right-of-way has to be
 
04:56:50.080 --> 04:56:51.990 align:start position:0%
the public right-of-way has to be
maintained

04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
04:56:56.150 --> 04:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:58.788 --> 04:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
and it's maintained for all users of the
 
04:57:01.550 --> 04:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
right-of-way and that includes cable and
 
04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunication companies
 
04:57:06.150 --> 04:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
and that they should not be exempted
 
04:57:08.788 --> 04:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
from paying their share of
 
04:57:10.230 --> 04:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
revenue that
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
not my written comments but as i was
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
driving down here
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
i was i was thinking about my my past
 
04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
life as a city manager
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
and how
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
our legal counsel whenever we
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
entered a lease with a private party for
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
use of municipal property so let's say
 
04:57:37.910 --> 04:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was a
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh a building in the industrial park
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
or it could have been you know even an
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
empty office at city hall if we wanted
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
to lease that space out to a
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:54.628 --> 04:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
current taxation law requires that we
 
04:57:54.638 --> 04:57:55.750 align:start position:0%
current taxation law requires that we
collect

04:57:55.750 --> 04:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
collect
 
04:57:57.510 --> 04:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
property tax from them
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
so to me that is an entirely
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
analogous situation so
 
04:58:04.230 --> 04:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
a municipality wants to rent space to a
 
04:58:04.240 --> 04:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
a municipality wants to rent space to a
small

04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
small
 
04:58:05.440 --> 04:58:07.030 align:start position:0%
small
business

04:58:07.030 --> 04:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:14.310 --> 04:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
it seems that this is again you know a
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
very very similar situation and that
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:23.670 --> 04:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
to give them a tax break
 
04:58:23.680 --> 04:58:25.110 align:start position:0%
to give them a tax break
so

04:58:25.110 --> 04:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
we'd ask that if the bill does go
 
04:58:28.400 --> 04:58:29.430 align:start position:0%
we'd ask that if the bill does go
forward

04:58:29.430 --> 04:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
at all
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
that it be studied in committee in a
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
full public process
 
04:58:36.788 --> 04:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
so that it could be understood what what
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
the real impact and intent is
 
04:58:42.310 --> 04:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'd ask that you vote the
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.310 --> 04:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
rep representative ames and then
 
04:58:50.470 --> 04:58:50.480 align:start position:0%

catherine heck
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire
 
04:59:58.470 --> 04:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:06.150 --> 05:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:08.628 --> 05:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman my name is catherine heck
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
 
05:00:12.798 --> 05:00:15.110 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
association

05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
association
 
05:00:17.430 --> 05:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm here to testify today in
 
05:00:20.550 --> 05:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 1494
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
um this legislation would exempt the
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
telecommunication companies as we've
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
heard in previous testimony from paying
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
their property taxes that would
 
05:00:33.030 --> 05:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise be payable under the rsa 7233
 
05:00:34.708 --> 05:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
um for that for the use of government
 
05:00:36.550 --> 05:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
owned property
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
if allowed to take effect you've already
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
heard testimony to the effect that this
 
05:00:42.868 --> 05:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
would result in a reduction in property
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
taxes paid by private industry
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
and in turn they would have to be made
 
05:00:50.230 --> 05:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
up for on the municipal side on the back
 
05:00:52.948 --> 05:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
of the local property tax payer
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
we wonder if any reduction would result
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
in a decrease in any user fees as most
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
businesses use the model of charging
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
based on their costs so whatever their
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
costs are is how they pass that along to
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
the consumer
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
furthermore i've heard about the double
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
tax so to make that argument our
 
05:01:16.390 --> 05:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would also then be paying a
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
double tax by subsidizing the not paying
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
of the right-of-way in addition to
 
05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
paying their property taxes
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
or if you look at a restaurant they're
 
05:01:27.510 --> 05:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
required to pay a property tax if they
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
lease or own a building and they work
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
that into their costs but they're also
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
have to pass along the meals in rooms
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
charge which is an additional tax so i
 
05:01:37.990 --> 05:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
guess we could look at that
 
05:01:39.830 --> 05:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
on either side of this equation people
 
05:01:41.750 --> 05:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
could be double taxed
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
but finally i would like to talk about
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
the broadband piece which is a huge
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
important piece to new hampshire
 
05:01:49.440 --> 05:01:51.030 align:start position:0%
important piece to new hampshire
and

05:01:51.030 --> 05:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
because i work in the role of helping
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities administer federal funds
 
05:01:57.750 --> 05:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
and most recently the arpa funds and the
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
cares act funds i've become very
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with broadband funding in new
 
05:02:01.680 --> 05:02:02.628 align:start position:0%
familiar with broadband funding in new
hampshire

05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
and as previous testimony stated the
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
capital fund just brought in 22 million
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
dollars for broadband projects for
 
05:02:11.830 --> 05:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
middle and last mile that has not been
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
fully deployed yet they are still
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
working on the grant eligibility
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
criteria those would be competitive
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
grants most likely for municipalities to
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
apply for there's a hundred million
 
05:02:22.868 --> 05:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
dollars in the infrastructure fund
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
specifically earmarked for new hampshire
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
to move forward with broadband projects
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
2.4 million dollars was deployed so
 
05:02:33.190 --> 05:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
students could connect from their home
 
05:02:33.200 --> 05:02:35.110 align:start position:0%
students could connect from their home
to

05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
a local provider that was another
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
arpa project that was
 
05:02:42.390 --> 05:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
not anything to do with the local monies
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
that towns received and local towns are
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
using some of their arpa funds also to
 
05:02:50.470 --> 05:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
move forward with broadband projects in
 
05:02:50.480 --> 05:02:51.670 align:start position:0%
move forward with broadband projects in
addition

05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
addition
 
05:02:53.670 --> 05:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure project granted
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
northern borders the regional commission
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
that represents belknap carroll cheshire
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
coast grafton and sullivan counties an
 
05:03:02.080 --> 05:03:03.510 align:start position:0%
coast grafton and sullivan counties an
additional

05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
allocation of funds because the northern
 
05:03:08.550 --> 05:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
part of our state is underserved in that
 
05:03:13.270 --> 05:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
area specifically and in 2021 they have
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
awarded hebron a grant in the amount of
 
05:03:19.030 --> 05:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
995 thousand dollars to do a 25 mile
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
fiber optic build out and the total cost
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
of that project to put it in perspective
 
05:03:25.110 --> 05:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
was 1.8 million
 
05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
they awarded sandwich with 840 000 in
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds to provide access to all
 
05:03:34.310 --> 05:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
users every household in the town that
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
total project was 3.5 million
 
05:03:39.670 --> 05:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
and just last year i had the opportunity
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
to work with my own small town in
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire at greenfield of
 
05:03:46.390 --> 05:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
1700 to do a public-private partnership
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
under the chesterfield model and work
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
with a internet provider to bring
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
broadband to every single household we
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
bonded that project and that will be
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
paid through user fees so
 
05:03:59.190 --> 05:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
there are these wonderful opportunities
 
05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
right now to bring broadband especially
 
05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
given the amount of federal dollars
 
05:04:05.510 --> 05:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
coming into our state and we would urge
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
you to vote
 
05:04:09.990 --> 05:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate as we believe
 
05:04:12.550 --> 05:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
this would um affect our our local
 
05:04:12.560 --> 05:04:13.910 align:start position:0%
this would um affect our our local
taxpayers

05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
05:04:15.990 --> 05:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
and budgets
 
05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions uh
 
05:04:20.310 --> 05:04:20.320 align:start position:0%

05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh

thank you for taking my question in your
opinion

05:04:27.190 --> 05:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
is this the place where these tens of
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars could be
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
used to build out the last mile of
 
05:04:36.150 --> 05:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
broadband in new hampshire yes it's
 
05:04:36.160 --> 05:04:37.030 align:start position:0%

uh

05:05:09.910 --> 05:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:12.150 --> 05:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many people
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
read the letter that came in last night
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
on our email from
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
margaret burns
 
05:05:18.000 --> 05:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
margaret burns
the

05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:05:22.628 --> 05:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
municipal association executive director
 
05:05:22.638 --> 05:05:23.430 align:start position:0%
municipal association executive director
but

05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:05:25.990 --> 05:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
in her last paragraph
 
05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
she claims that on the basis of the 2007
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision new hampshire
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision
 
05:05:37.990 --> 05:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
that it is unconstitutional to subject
 
05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
certain entities in that case to a
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
telephone company to taxation under rsa
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
72 23 1b
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
while not taxing other entities gas
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
cable and electric companies that use
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
the public property in the same manner
 
05:05:56.708 --> 05:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
and claims that
 
05:05:59.350 --> 05:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
hb 1494
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
does exactly that and that it would be
 
05:06:06.150 --> 05:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
declared invalidated by the courts
 
05:06:08.550 --> 05:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
can you explain given
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
what we've been hearing before
 
05:06:14.390 --> 05:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
about the court history of this
 
05:06:14.400 --> 05:06:15.670 align:start position:0%
about the court history of this
on

05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:06:18.150 --> 05:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
whether you agree with what's gone
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
before or what's in this letter
 
05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
so i certainly agree with what's in the
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
letter i am not an attorney so that was
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
sent to by one of our legal counsel so
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
that it because it contains a legal
 
05:06:31.590 --> 05:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
opinion so i cannot
 
05:06:33.270 --> 05:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
speak further on that other than there
 
05:06:34.948 --> 05:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
is a court case and it's the exact
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
opposite it had to do with
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
gas and cable and electric companies not
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
being taxed you know it but it's to the
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
effect that everyone has to be taxed
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
equitably and fairly so then we would
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
have to re-look at from my understanding
 
05:06:50.550 --> 05:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
how we're taxing and assessing the
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
rights of way for other types of
 
05:06:57.030 --> 05:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
users so gas companies for example would
 
05:07:01.830 --> 05:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:04.230 --> 05:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up you'll see
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:07:05.520 --> 05:07:06.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you

tony kaplan from merrimack six who

supports the bill obviously
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh members of the
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.190 --> 05:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
at the outset i should say that this
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't intended to alter the
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
conservation program of the land and
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
community heritage program
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
so much as it is intended to formalize
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
agricultural resources
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
as a worthy statewide priority for
 
05:09:23.920 --> 05:09:26.070 align:start position:0%
as a worthy statewide priority for
conservation

05:09:26.070 --> 05:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
i want to recognize the invaluable work
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
that the atlanta community heritage
 
05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
investment program already does
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
with farm conservation under its natural
 
05:09:36.150 --> 05:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
resource rubric
 
05:09:38.470 --> 05:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
by formalizing agriculture as a priority
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
area written into law
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
i don't foresee or intend to rethink the
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
organization's strategizing on the
 
05:09:46.470 --> 05:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
choices it makes
 
05:09:48.150 --> 05:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
which are based on well thought out
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
criteria and networking with a large
 
05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
number of stakeholder organizations and
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
citizens across new hampshire
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
but what i do want to do is give
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
agricultural organizations and groups
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
that represent diverse farming interests
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
and local food interests a seat at the
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
table when prioritizing how best to
 
05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
conserve the state's resources
 
05:10:09.750 --> 05:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the background to this bill are the
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
demographic challenges facing new
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire farms where nearly one-third
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
of farmers are 65 or over and most of
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
these are farming without a younger
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
farmer alongside them ready to take over
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
operations or a plan for succession
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
this data suggests that the future of
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
farming in new hampshire may be facing
 
05:10:29.830 --> 05:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
uncertainty that could hurt our state's
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
character and quality of life
 
05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's important to take steps to
 
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that at the appropriate time
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
there is a way forward including
 
05:10:40.470 --> 05:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
increased use of agricultural easements
 
05:10:42.070 --> 05:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
for interested parties to ensure that
 
05:10:44.550 --> 05:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
these properties remain as farms
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
why is it important to conserve farms i
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
think it goes beyond the scenic value of
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
having farms remain a part of the
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
landscape although that too is important
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
i believe it is a strategic goal for the
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
state to retain
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
as much food self-sufficiency as we can
 
05:11:05.190 --> 05:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
for several reasons
 
05:11:07.270 --> 05:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
we've seen what the covid pandemic has
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
done to supply chains and distribution
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
of goods across the country
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
having our food sourced from local farms
 
05:11:16.708 --> 05:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
means less exposure to the disruptions
 
05:11:18.550 --> 05:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
of supply and
 
05:11:18.560 --> 05:11:19.830 align:start position:0%
of supply and
uh

05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
that may come with future climate change
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
events and god forbid an even worse
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic than the one we're currently
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
still in
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
also local food is healthy food by and
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
large and one of the hidden costs in our
 
05:11:33.190 --> 05:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
society that again we're seeing play out
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
tragically in the pandemic is our over
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
reliance on industrially produced
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
highly processed foods coming from afar
 
05:11:42.550 --> 05:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes very far that are the exact
 
05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
opposite of local food produced on small
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
farms that are answerable
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
to a clientele of friends and neighbors
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
and fellow citizens
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
the u.s industrial food system although
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
producing an abundance of cheap
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
questionably nutritious food also leads
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
to epidemic levels of obesity and
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
chronic disease that makes our country
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
one of the unhealthiest in the world
 
05:12:04.948 --> 05:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
tragically with a falling life
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
expectancy rate due in part to our junk
 
05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
food diet
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
retaining our farm landscape as a
 
05:12:13.350 --> 05:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
working landscape supplying products
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
to local as well as export markets is
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
the first step to ensure that new
 
05:12:19.590 --> 05:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens can rely on local
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
healthy food options now and in the
 
05:12:21.440 --> 05:12:22.948 align:start position:0%
healthy food options now and in the
future

05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
currently it's estimated that new
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire farms could support about six
 
05:12:28.470 --> 05:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
percent of the state's population with
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
local food
 
05:12:31.350 --> 05:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest percentages in new
 
05:12:31.360 --> 05:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest percentages in new
england

05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
england
 
05:12:34.150 --> 05:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's imperative that we make efforts to
 
05:12:36.550 --> 05:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
increase that level of food security as
 
05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
a safeguard against future lean times as
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
well as the advantages of local food to
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
greater health
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
local farms retain dollars in local
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
economies that would otherwise flow out
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
of state
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining a base of viable productive
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
farms will greatly enhance new hampshire
 
05:12:55.350 --> 05:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
and economic terms and in ways
 
05:12:57.990 --> 05:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
that our current economic system fails
 
05:13:00.150 --> 05:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
to measure such as greater health
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
environmental services such as carbon
 
05:13:04.070 --> 05:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
sequestration along with the
 
05:13:06.550 --> 05:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
already mentioned scenic value
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
local agriculture contributes
 
05:13:09.430 --> 05:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
significantly to new hampshire's
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
economic output despite the challenges
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
facing the state's farmers new hampshire
 
05:13:16.150 --> 05:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
has more than 4 thousand farms covering
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
470 000 acres
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
the state estimates agricultural
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
industries supports more than 20
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
thousand jobs with an economic value of
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
some 850 million dollars
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
this includes 479 million dollars in
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
direct sales of agricultural and other
 
05:13:34.230 --> 05:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
horticultural products and services and
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
372 million in direct spending by
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
agricultural related tourism
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
increasing those numbers relies on many
 
05:13:42.948 --> 05:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
factors but an essential component will
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
be increasing the ability of young and
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
beginning farmers to access agricultural
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
land and that will depend on retaining
 
05:13:51.670 --> 05:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
our existing farms as productive parts
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the economy as the current generation
 
05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
of farmers look to pass on their
 
05:13:55.600 --> 05:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
of farmers look to pass on their
holdings

05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
holdings
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
market forces work against farm
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
retention and we see that becoming
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
especially true given recent hikes in
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
land speculation and spiking land prices
 
05:14:07.990 --> 05:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural land values are increasing
 
05:14:10.150 --> 05:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
at a seven percent year-to-year rate not
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
seen in over a decade according to the
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
u.s department of agriculture's 2021
 
05:14:17.350 --> 05:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
land value summary report
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizen sits at the high
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
end of variation across the country
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
given our northeastern location
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
all the more reason that there is an
 
05:14:27.430 --> 05:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
additional funding mechanism attached to
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
this bill that would include increase
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
the l-chip's ability to fund a wide
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
array of projects going forward and help
 
05:14:35.590 --> 05:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
meet the state's strategic conservation
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
needs in a fiscally responsible fashion
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll conclude my comments
 
05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
and ask for your support for this bill
 
05:14:44.470 --> 05:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm willing to take questions
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
i have one question and maybe it's a
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
comment um i know in my town stratum i
 
05:14:53.830 --> 05:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
can think of at least four farms
 
05:14:55.750 --> 05:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we've put into conservation but the
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
town that was a town effort to put them
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
in conservation
 
05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
we raised the money with the town and i
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'll let the elche people talk in a
 
05:15:02.560 --> 05:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
i'll let the elche people talk in a
minute

05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
minute
 
05:15:05.590 --> 05:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
i i can't recall if we took a little up
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
chapman are you ready we did yes
 
05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
so it seems like there's already a
 
05:15:09.680 --> 05:15:10.948 align:start position:0%
so it seems like there's already a
mechanism

05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
to try to preserve our our town's uh
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
land and heritage by preserving the
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
farms one of the bigger ones is this
 
05:15:20.470 --> 05:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
doug skaman's farm
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
who was his former speaker of the house
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's in conservation most properties
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
in conservation
 
05:15:26.638 --> 05:15:28.830 align:start position:0%
in conservation
so

05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
um well i i i guess
 
05:15:34.150 --> 05:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
some of what you want to do is already
 
05:15:34.160 --> 05:15:35.190 align:start position:0%
some of what you want to do is already
happening

05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if you're aware of that
 
05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:15:39.830 --> 05:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah man as i mentioned in my testimony
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
the l chip already does do a lot of work
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
with agricultural easements there's no
 
05:15:44.948 --> 05:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
no question about that
 
05:15:47.910 --> 05:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
um uh my point is that that that uh
 
05:15:49.510 --> 05:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
the desire for more of those projects
 
05:15:51.030 --> 05:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
will only increase you know in the
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
coming years all right thank you
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:15:55.990 --> 05:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative raumi and then
 
05:15:58.390 --> 05:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative laurie
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you the l-chip letter that we've
 
05:16:03.430 --> 05:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
already gotten now
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
says that 41 of all land conservation
 
05:16:08.868 --> 05:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
projects funded by l-chip have included
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
farmland protection
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
which sounds to me like they could
 
05:16:16.550 --> 05:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
easily use the extra money that you're
 
05:16:18.550 --> 05:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
taking from the general and education
 
05:16:19.990 --> 05:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
trust funds
 
05:16:20.000 --> 05:16:21.670 align:start position:0%
trust funds
on

05:16:21.670 --> 05:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
for those purposes that they're already
 
05:16:24.840 --> 05:16:26.390 align:start position:0%
for those purposes that they're already
doing

05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:33.190 --> 05:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
to use that
 
05:16:35.430 --> 05:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
that extra money they could already
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for what
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
there isn't
 
05:16:46.550 --> 05:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
but it looks like there would be
 
05:16:48.948 --> 05:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether it's legal legally
 
05:16:52.550 --> 05:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
required language or not but that uh
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
anything it that was not for a farm
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
would um
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
go back to the general fund if it wasn't
 
05:17:01.760 --> 05:17:03.510 align:start position:0%
go back to the general fund if it wasn't
spent

05:17:03.510 --> 05:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
spent
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
of this extra money yes
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct although the the money is
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
not intended strictly for farm
 
05:17:13.030 --> 05:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
conservation the money raised by this
 
05:17:15.190 --> 05:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill would go to all the strategic areas
 
05:17:17.670 --> 05:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the lg i couldn't sorry i can't hear
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
you the money the money raised by the
 
05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
wording of this bill is not intended
 
05:17:24.070 --> 05:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
strictly for agricultural uses it's use
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's intended for the overall use of the
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
l-chip program
 
05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation for
 
05:17:36.868 --> 05:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
for l-chip in addition to the one that
 
05:17:38.310 --> 05:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
they have had
 
05:17:40.868 --> 05:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you that helps quite a lot
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
um the other question was what is a farm
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
does it include the woodlots that i'm
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
not sure they count
 
05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
as far as the strict definition of what
 
05:17:53.990 --> 05:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
a farm is you know i really couldn't
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
answer that question i'm sure somebody
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
from the department of agriculture might
 
05:17:59.350 --> 05:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
know the legal definition of a farm if
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
someone right behind you would know an
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:05.270 --> 05:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
it would however if we were going to
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
hold it to that have to
 
05:18:09.670 --> 05:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
tie to the definition of agriculture
 
05:18:11.430 --> 05:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's i think which i think that
 
05:18:11.440 --> 05:18:12.948 align:start position:0%
that's i think which i think that
includes

05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
includes
 
05:18:15.030 --> 05:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh tourism weddings
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
i mean i know that's a controversial
 
05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
issue and there are there have been you
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
know bills recently
 
05:18:21.190 --> 05:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
around what is
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a farm so you know
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
i think i think you can ask
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper that question okay
 
05:18:30.830 --> 05:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay well he's going to be next uh
 
05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative ah thank you mr chair
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
i i noticed in the bill that it
 
05:18:38.550 --> 05:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
indicates that uh uh you're an ad people
 
05:18:39.750 --> 05:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
commission that would include
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
representing local interests
 
05:18:46.628 --> 05:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
but this would be a statewide commission
 
05:18:47.910 --> 05:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
so how can they
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
represent local interest if they're
 
05:18:50.160 --> 05:18:51.670 align:start position:0%
represent local interest if they're
representing

05:18:51.670 --> 05:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
representing
 
05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
as would be the first part of the
 
05:18:54.480 --> 05:18:55.590 align:start position:0%
as would be the first part of the
question

05:18:55.590 --> 05:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
and the second part of the question is
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
local planning boards
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
have to take into consideration current
 
05:19:02.638 --> 05:19:03.510 align:start position:0%
have to take into consideration current
use

05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
when they were creating a subdivision
 
05:19:08.708 --> 05:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
or they're creating an industrial area
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
depending upon
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
where the general land or the
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
agricultural land is being
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh converted
 
05:19:16.708 --> 05:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
so it's aren't the
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
issues to which you just spoke already
 
05:19:21.030 --> 05:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
being addressed
 
05:19:23.350 --> 05:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
would be the second part
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay as far as local food interests
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
which is the wording of the bill
 
05:19:29.830 --> 05:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
there are organizations that are working
 
05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
on on increasing the supply of food
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the state as a whole from locally
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
sourced farms so when it says local food
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
it means it's a statewide
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
rubric and those organizations work all
 
05:19:45.030 --> 05:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
that would be supported by this by
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
having a voice at the table of the
 
05:19:48.958 --> 05:19:50.628 align:start position:0%
having a voice at the table of the
l-chip

05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
l-chip
 
05:19:52.708 --> 05:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
as far as what planning boards
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
do in terms of zoning for agriculture
 
05:19:59.350 --> 05:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how the how this bill would
 
05:19:59.360 --> 05:20:00.550 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how the how this bill would
impact

05:20:00.550 --> 05:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
impact
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
at that level of
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the of the process
 
05:20:05.280 --> 05:20:07.030 align:start position:0%
of the of the process
so

05:20:07.030 --> 05:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:08.948 --> 05:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
yes follow
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
i was referring to the fact that a
 
05:20:11.520 --> 05:20:12.628 align:start position:0%
i was referring to the fact that a
landowner

05:20:12.628 --> 05:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
regardless of who it is has the right to
 
05:20:17.350 --> 05:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
use his land profit from his land or
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
dispose of his land
 
05:20:21.750 --> 05:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
would this not
 
05:20:23.670 --> 05:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
kind of get in the way of that if
 
05:20:23.680 --> 05:20:24.708 align:start position:0%
kind of get in the way of that if
somebody

05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
um say was the last member of a family
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
who wanted to do farming and
 
05:20:32.948 --> 05:20:32.958 align:start position:0%
open the gate and let the cows go out
 
05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
roaming across group 111.
 
05:20:38.548 --> 05:20:38.558 align:start position:0%
yeah no i mean i i think that what this
 
05:20:40.868 --> 05:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
would do would be offer more choices to
 
05:20:42.390 --> 05:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
people in that position
 
05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
um this is not a man it's not saying you
 
05:20:45.910 --> 05:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
have to do this or you have to do that
 
05:20:47.190 --> 05:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
for people who want to keep their farms
 
05:20:51.750 --> 05:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
in farming and and and this would offer
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
them a way forward and make it easier to
 
05:20:57.990 --> 05:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.070 --> 05:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
05:21:02.788 --> 05:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
i'm in greenland
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
and i think uh there's some property in
 
05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
greenland that's benefiting
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
from this as well
 
05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's going into
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh conservation now family will
 
05:21:22.470 --> 05:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
hikers and 150 acres i believe
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
but the overarching
 
05:21:28.638 --> 05:21:30.708 align:start position:0%
but the overarching
uh

05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
the rule setting of this thing is has
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
been set up by the southeast land trust
 
05:21:35.200 --> 05:21:36.070 align:start position:0%
been set up by the southeast land trust
so

05:21:36.070 --> 05:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:37.990 --> 05:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
like following up on
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
the question about how this proceeds
 
05:21:41.350 --> 05:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
down the
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
down the road i believe that would you
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
would you agree that land is
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
set up for the next 100 years are in
 
05:21:50.470 --> 05:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
perpetuity for
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
conservation because of its
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's a southeast land trust that's
 
05:21:56.788 --> 05:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
really putting this uh together
 
05:21:58.628 --> 05:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
am i speaking correctly about this or
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
well i'm not sure the details of that
 
05:22:02.948 --> 05:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
arrangement but usually there are you
 
05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
know there are different stakeholders
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
that get involved in these projects so
 
05:22:07.350 --> 05:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not surprised that a land trust is
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
involved and sometimes it's
 
05:22:09.990 --> 05:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities sometimes it's a
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
combination of that and they usually
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
look for some kind of funding
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
from something like the l-chip to to
 
05:22:17.910 --> 05:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
complete the package
 
05:22:17.920 --> 05:22:18.788 align:start position:0%
complete the package
um

05:22:18.788 --> 05:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
but yeah they're usually uh working 100
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
years down the road i mean it depends
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
but they're taking that land out of
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
development for a certain number of
 
05:22:27.040 --> 05:22:30.150 align:start position:0%
development for a certain number of
years

05:22:30.150 --> 05:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:31.350 --> 05:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
you all said
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh none so thank you very much for your
 
05:22:39.760 --> 05:22:41.030 align:start position:0%
uh none so thank you very much for your
testimony

05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:22:43.510 --> 05:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh speaking of uh former speakers of the
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
house sean jasper who's also
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
currently the
 
05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of agriculture who's
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
05:23:02.070 --> 05:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
committee it's always a pleasure to be
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
back in
 
05:23:05.830 --> 05:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
front of ways and means where i uh spent
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
more years than on any other uh
 
05:23:10.948 --> 05:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
policy committee during my time in the
 
05:23:12.788 --> 05:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
house and you survived then you survived
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
i did
 
05:23:16.708 --> 05:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
you must have served with susan then i i
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
certainly did
 
05:23:19.040 --> 05:23:23.190 align:start position:0%
certainly did
and

05:23:23.190 --> 05:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:25.590 --> 05:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
she has the mic off it was probably good
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
i have a feeling
 
05:23:32.310 --> 05:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
she said
 
05:23:32.320 --> 05:23:33.590 align:start position:0%
she said
um

05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
at any rate
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
might surprise you i i am here in
 
05:23:42.548 --> 05:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
i do believe that if it ain't broke we
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't fix it
 
05:23:49.590 --> 05:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
in this case i don't think that l-chip
 
05:23:49.600 --> 05:23:50.548 align:start position:0%
in this case i don't think that l-chip
is

05:23:50.548 --> 05:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
is broken in this regard at all i do sit
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
on l-chip as a non-voting member
 
05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
representing obviously agriculture
 
05:23:59.360 --> 05:24:01.030 align:start position:0%
representing obviously agriculture
so

05:24:01.030 --> 05:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
when i look at adding a person
 
05:24:05.430 --> 05:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
representing agriculture i think about
 
05:24:06.868 --> 05:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
well now we're probably going to open it
 
05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
up to more areas wanting to be
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
represented and i don't think that's
 
05:24:13.590 --> 05:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's healthy but if i consider
 
05:24:16.150 --> 05:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture to be a natural resource
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
so i think it's already represented i'm
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
a little bit puzzled by representing
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
agricultural and local interests because
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you would define that
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
but i would point out that currently
 
05:24:29.190 --> 05:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
there's already one member who shall
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
represent municipal interests that's a
 
05:24:33.430 --> 05:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
low that's local interest
 
05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
one representing local planning
 
05:24:37.510 --> 05:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
interests that's a local interest
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
and one representing regional planning
 
05:24:39.840 --> 05:24:40.948 align:start position:0%
and one representing regional planning
commissions

05:24:40.948 --> 05:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
and generally i would consider that to
 
05:24:42.958 --> 05:24:44.150 align:start position:0%
and generally i would consider that to
be

05:24:44.150 --> 05:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
local as well
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
but with the commissioner of agriculture
 
05:24:49.510 --> 05:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
sitting even though it's a non-voting
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
position i think agriculture has been
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
well represented
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that during my four
 
05:24:59.280 --> 05:25:01.030 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that during my four
years

05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
sitting there
 
05:25:04.230 --> 05:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
the voting members have listened very
 
05:25:06.548 --> 05:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
carefully to what what i've had to say
 
05:25:07.350 --> 05:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:25:09.510 --> 05:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
do not feel that by not having a vote
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
that that's really
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
had a negative impact
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
to the agricultural
 
05:25:16.948 --> 05:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
interests at all
 
05:25:19.830 --> 05:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
um in
 
05:25:21.990 --> 05:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
this past year we were fortunate first
 
05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
time in four years we actually had more
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
money than we had
 
05:25:27.030 --> 05:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
applicants i don't see
 
05:25:29.830 --> 05:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
the reason to take money away
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
from the many other needed areas in
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
state government to put it here i think
 
05:25:36.868 --> 05:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
the balance has been struck pretty well
 
05:25:36.878 --> 05:25:38.310 align:start position:0%
the balance has been struck pretty well
additionally

05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
as you may or may not know
 
05:25:42.868 --> 05:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
prior to l-chip existing
 
05:25:44.070 --> 05:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
there was a program within the
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture to buy
 
05:25:49.510 --> 05:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
specifically agricultural lands
 
05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
that was not funded after l-chip
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
came into existence but in the last two
 
05:25:54.718 --> 05:25:55.670 align:start position:0%
came into existence but in the last two
budgets

05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
05:25:59.430 --> 05:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
it has been funded covet is sort of
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
um not allowed me to get to where i'd
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
like to be at this at this point but it
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund and we expect to get
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
that up and running and i and i think if
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
there was a need for
 
05:26:14.070 --> 05:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
more money for agricultural lands
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
specifically that would be a better
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
place to put it because
 
05:26:19.590 --> 05:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
it would be specific to
 
05:26:19.600 --> 05:26:20.948 align:start position:0%
it would be specific to
agriculture

05:26:20.948 --> 05:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
05:26:22.948 --> 05:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
as you just heard from the sponsor and i
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the fact that he has put
 
05:26:24.718 --> 05:26:25.510 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the fact that he has put
this

05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:26:28.150 --> 05:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
this bill in and his his thoughts in in
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
that area but i think if if we felt
 
05:26:31.590 --> 05:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
there was a need for more money it
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
fund which allows us also to match
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
05:26:41.030 --> 05:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
and there are other matches out there
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
for l-chip and none of the l-chip pro
 
05:26:46.548 --> 05:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
projects really are just stand-alone
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
with l-chip and i i think the system is
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
working very well
 
05:26:53.350 --> 05:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
at this time um and i really
 
05:26:56.310 --> 05:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
um while i am you know 100 percent
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
behind the mission of l-chip and applaud
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
what it does and i have to tell you that
 
05:27:04.150 --> 05:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know agriculture has been
 
05:27:05.590 --> 05:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
very very
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
well treated by the l-chip board in the
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
time that i've been there and i think
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
from the the information you have in the
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
letter from l-chip
 
05:27:15.910 --> 05:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
it always has been
 
05:27:18.070 --> 05:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't think there's a
 
05:27:20.310 --> 05:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
any should be any concern that l-chip is
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
not being
 
05:27:23.910 --> 05:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
fair to agricultural interests i'll be
 
05:27:26.070 --> 05:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions well just
 
05:27:29.190 --> 05:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
this just for the record again
 
05:27:31.830 --> 05:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
your position is that
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
clearly there are agricultural projects
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
as well as other projects and
 
05:27:38.548 --> 05:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
agriculture is not discriminated against
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
in any way not at all okay thank you
 
05:27:41.600 --> 05:27:44.070 align:start position:0%
in any way not at all okay thank you
president

05:27:44.070 --> 05:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
president
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you uh
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
again i just want to kind of summarize
 
05:27:50.470 --> 05:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
what i think i heard from you which was
 
05:27:52.548 --> 05:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
that between our current current use
 
05:27:52.558 --> 05:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
that between our current current use
laws

05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
laws
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
and our l-chip program
 
05:27:57.830 --> 05:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
current use keeping spaces open and the
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
l-chip program buying conservation
 
05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
easements that the green spaces and
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
farms in new hampshire are pretty well
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
protected and anybody wants some sort of
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
protection has roots available to them
 
05:28:09.510 --> 05:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's no re need to expand this
 
05:28:09.520 --> 05:28:10.868 align:start position:0%
there's no re need to expand this
program

05:28:10.868 --> 05:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:28:12.788 --> 05:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
05:28:14.788 --> 05:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
with the program that i've reinstituted
 
05:28:16.390 --> 05:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's very true the federal
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
government has put a lot of money into
 
05:28:20.470 --> 05:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
the farm bill and i can tell you that i
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
am not aware of any farm in the state of
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that has wanted to convert
 
05:28:28.230 --> 05:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
their land into protected
 
05:28:31.030 --> 05:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
lands that has not been able to and
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
which has gone out of business as a
 
05:28:34.390 --> 05:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
result of
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
of that lack of funding so i do think we
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
found a good balance within the state of
 
05:28:40.708 --> 05:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire at this time thank you
 
05:28:40.718 --> 05:28:42.150 align:start position:0%

century with microphones now
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
we certainly have
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%

05:29:12.558 --> 05:29:13.670 align:start position:0%
if i could address what representative
omni

05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
omni
 
05:29:13.680 --> 05:29:14.548 align:start position:0%
omni
asked

05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
asked
 
05:29:14.558 --> 05:29:16.868 align:start position:0%
asked
um

05:29:16.868 --> 05:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
forestry is part of agriculture within
 
05:29:21.990 --> 05:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
the definition i think it's 21
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
a so
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
within our within the department's
 
05:29:26.958 --> 05:29:28.708 align:start position:0%
within our within the department's
farm

05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
farm
 
05:29:28.718 --> 05:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
farm

05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:29:29.760 --> 05:29:30.628 align:start position:0%
program
only

05:29:30.628 --> 05:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
actual agricultural land has been
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
purchased to this point i'm not sure
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that would be um
 
05:29:40.150 --> 05:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
something that you know we couldn't
 
05:29:42.310 --> 05:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
purchase part of a farm with forestry
 
05:29:44.310 --> 05:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
because i think under the definition and
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
it does allow it but it it clearly is
 
05:29:49.510 --> 05:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
when you look at at the rsas
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
it is included so
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time thank
 
05:29:55.190 --> 05:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
you no more questions correct okay
 
05:29:57.510 --> 05:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
you're all set thank you
 
05:29:59.830 --> 05:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
and our last pink card is paula
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
left the best for last
 
05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you so much for
 
05:30:10.708 --> 05:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak i will be very
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
brief because commissioner jasper is an
 
05:30:15.270 --> 05:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
outstanding spokesperson for elship as
 
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
it turns out um i do rather than
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing what you already have in front
 
05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
of you i just want to highlight a few
 
05:30:22.708 --> 05:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
points that came up in your earlier
 
05:30:22.718 --> 05:30:23.830 align:start position:0%
points that came up in your earlier
discussion

05:30:23.830 --> 05:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
um what this bill proposes to do is
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
increase our funding but it does limit
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
use of that increased funding which is
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 500 000 a year to only
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
acquisition projects l-chip also does
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
historic rehabilitation projects and
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
studies this bill would not allow us to
 
05:30:40.878 --> 05:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
studies this bill would not allow us to
use

05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:30:43.990 --> 05:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
these new funds for that purpose
 
05:30:47.110 --> 05:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
so it would um it's also a lapsing
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
funding source where our current funding
 
05:30:51.030 --> 05:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
is non-lapsing so it would require some
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
minor administrative
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
adjustments on our part but i wouldn't
 
05:30:56.788 --> 05:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
consider those insurmountable by any
 
05:30:59.110 --> 05:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
means and the funding um the increased
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
funding would absolutely be welcome and
 
05:31:03.430 --> 05:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
well used there are farms i can think of
 
05:31:06.470 --> 05:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
one right now in milan that is not that
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
wishes to be conserved and can't be
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
those problems range from a lack of
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
available funding also easement holders
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
up in the north country is a problem so
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
there are a number of problems that
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
could be addressed that would increase
 
05:31:22.708 --> 05:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
the pace of farmland conservation
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
funding is is one aspect of that lcp
 
05:31:26.708 --> 05:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
will never turn away a new funding
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
source so i certainly do not want to go
 
05:31:30.548 --> 05:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
on record saying we have enough funding
 
05:31:33.430 --> 05:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
we have turned away approximately 500
 
05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
projects in the life of the program and
 
05:31:36.868 --> 05:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
about half of those are land
 
05:31:39.430 --> 05:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
conservation thankfully only 13 have
 
05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
been farms and of those there's only one
 
05:31:45.750 --> 05:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
that i am aware of that was converted to
 
05:31:48.548 --> 05:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
developed use so our record of farmland
 
05:31:51.030 --> 05:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
protection is very very strong but that
 
05:31:52.708 --> 05:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
does not mean there aren't farms that
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
aren't protected that could be
 
05:31:57.190 --> 05:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
farmland conservation is one of the
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
hardest types of conservation to do
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
it is very complicated in terms of land
 
05:32:05.590 --> 05:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
use it's very challenging for the farmer
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
to make the decision to put their land
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
in conservation and it's very
 
05:32:11.190 --> 05:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
challenging for the organizations that
 
05:32:13.590 --> 05:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
are taking on the easement so in
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
greenland yes that is a southeast land
 
05:32:17.670 --> 05:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
trust project that's going to protect
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
farmland it's also going to protect you
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
know the great bay estuary it's also
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
going to protect drinking water supply
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's a fantastic project but
 
05:32:26.708 --> 05:32:26.718 align:start position:0%
there are multiple stakeholders and it's
 
05:32:26.718 --> 05:32:28.150 align:start position:0%
there are multiple stakeholders and it's
complicated

05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of work still to be
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
done a farm does include a woodlot often
 
05:32:34.868 --> 05:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
and this is true when we work with our
 
05:32:36.708 --> 05:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
federal funding partners if you think
 
05:32:38.310 --> 05:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
about a historic farm you're going to
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
have a certain amount that is in crop
 
05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
and then the farmer is also relying on
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
that wood lot and that continues to this
 
05:32:47.110 --> 05:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
day so those um farmland does for us
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
include that
 
05:32:50.788 --> 05:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
and i think um the only other thing i
 
05:32:53.110 --> 05:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
would just clarify is 100 years we do
 
05:32:55.750 --> 05:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
work in perpetuity um so we deal in
 
05:32:57.030 --> 05:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
forever so the farms that we're
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
conserving as well as all of our
 
05:33:01.990 --> 05:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
conservation land is protected forever
 
05:33:03.750 --> 05:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
and with that i am happy to answer any
 
05:33:03.760 --> 05:33:04.788 align:start position:0%
and with that i am happy to answer any
questions

05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay any questions
 
05:33:09.670 --> 05:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
nope seeing none thank you very much
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome thank you does does
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
anyone have a question on the fiscal
 
05:33:16.150 --> 05:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
note we have the dra here
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think we're talking about five hundred
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
thousand ish
 
05:33:22.070 --> 05:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:23.670 --> 05:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh one quarter percent
 
05:33:25.590 --> 05:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
would be five hundred thousand
 
05:33:25.600 --> 05:33:26.788 align:start position:0%
would be five hundred thousand
um

05:33:26.788 --> 05:33:26.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
that that would come out of
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
education and the general general fund
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's 33 percent
 
05:33:37.110 --> 05:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
goes education and 67 goes to the
 
05:33:38.948 --> 05:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
05:33:41.910 --> 05:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
but if anybody needs clarity we have dra
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
here no okay
 
05:33:44.320 --> 05:33:45.110 align:start position:0%
here no okay
so

05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:48.070 --> 05:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh anyone else want to testify
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
saying none um
 
05:33:50.080 --> 05:33:51.350 align:start position:0%
saying none um
representative

05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:33:53.750 --> 05:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
genegan can you just grab the
 
05:34:03.670 --> 05:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
okay so no one on the blue sheet i will
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on house bill 1450.
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
nothing tomorrow
 
05:34:15.360 --> 05:34:21.670 align:start position:0%
nothing tomorrow
no

05:34:21.670 --> 05:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.150 --> 05:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.160 --> 05:34:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:34:37.030 --> 05:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:34:38.310 --> 05:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
let's start with tuesday start with
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
tuesday it talks with the caucus
 
05:34:50.070 --> 05:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
hey good seeing you glad you're back
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:57.440 --> 05:34:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
