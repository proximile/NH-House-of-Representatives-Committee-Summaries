00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
over dollar thresholds which vary a
 
00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:03.919 align:start position:0%
little bit but um
 
00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that the money's there make
 
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
sure that the the paperwork is all done
 
00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that there is a
 
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's a paper trail for transactions
 
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a that they're
 
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
pre-audited of most transactions this is
 
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
an important piece of the fiscal control
 
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
it is the fiscal control agency of the
 
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.509 align:start position:0%
it is the fiscal control agency of the
state

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
as part of the capital budget there's a
 
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
capital budget request which is
 
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
fairly firmly ensconced in the capital
 
00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
budget and very high on
 
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
dennis goulet's ranking of i.t projects
 
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that so that
 
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
um even if it fell off it would be it
 
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
would be done which is moving to the
 
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's listed as moving to the cloud we
 
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
take the state's enterprise software
 
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
system and move it to the cloud
 
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's much more complicated than that
 
00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's a very significant upgrade
 
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
and as part of that we would move to a
 
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
cloud-based service instead of a instead
 
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
you know land-based service if you will
 
00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
um but it would be
 
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
the most significant financial upgrade
 
00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
to the state in
 
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
probably a dozen years and we'll talk
 
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
about that when we talk about fdm
 
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
but included here are three positions
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
one in the commissioner's office
 
00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
one in the accounting services office
 
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
and one in fdm
 
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
but i've bundled them together because
 
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
they are part of
 
00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
the financial systems upgrade this will
 
00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.190 align:start position:0%
the financial systems upgrade this will
be

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
enormously complicated will affect every
 
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
agency around the state
 
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
and these are the positions are all
 
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
business systems analysts or
 
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the case of fdm and information
 
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
systems analyst and it would be part of
 
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.429 align:start position:0%
systems analyst and it would be part of
that

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
massive undertaking would you need these
 
00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing year after year even after the
 
00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
upgrade so we
 
00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
we would because um for example the fdm
 
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
position would continue to do
 
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
the the regular upgrades the state's
 
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
financial systems got in trouble over
 
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
decades when we stopped upgrading and we
 
00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
you know ended up having and i know you
 
00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
know this i'm not sure everybody's aware
 
00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
the history where um we had a financial
 
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
system that was
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know put in place in 1983 and then
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
we kind of didn't upgrade it very much
 
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
it'd be like if you were using
 
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
wordperfect instead of or
 
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
in wordperfect3 with dual disk drive and
 
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
that was kind of where we were
 
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
as a state we need to upgrade
 
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
continually in an ongoing basis
 
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
or else we end up having a system that's
 
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
defunct and dead
 
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
and we end up spending 20 30 40 million
 
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
dollars to get a new system
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's part of what this is the the
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
position in accounting services would to
 
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
be honest once this project was done
 
00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 align:start position:0%
which is a multi-year project would move
 
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
into the fixed asset module
 
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
and would uh and would um would perform
 
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
that function there
 
00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 align:start position:0%
so that um they would be on an ongoing
 
00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.910 align:start position:0%
so that um they would be on an ongoing
basis

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
what happens if you don't get these
 
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
um well we're gonna upgrade the system
 
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
anyway it just becomes enormously
 
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.830 align:start position:0%
anyway it just becomes enormously
difficult

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
um it becomes
 
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
um i i don't want to say it becomes a
 
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
complete nightmare to do
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
people might know that when we did the
 
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
original erp
 
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
the system that's now in for um 10
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
12 years ago we basically asked people
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to point at joe joe
 
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
bouchard did
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
the upgrade from nine to five
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then came back to the office at
 
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
about 4 30
 
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
and did his regular job of assistant
 
00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.270 align:start position:0%
and did his regular job of assistant
commissioner

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
and it damn near killed him one of your
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioners i'm not sure if
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's cassie or joe since they're
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
together would also like to say
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
something on this topic
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
cassie is it you or joe who wishes to
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
speak um
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
it's me please i would just like to
 
00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
point out that the very last slide
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
on the back of your slide deck has all
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
the detail about the bundles and the
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you cassie thank you so i have the
 
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.350 align:start position:0%
thank you cassie thank you so i have the
same

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
question here sarah does this include
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
all those costs and if not what would
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
those be
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have to for every
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
one of these will you just say to
 
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
yourself i'll figure that out and get it
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
over to them
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you charlie please continue
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that um so that's
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
accounting services broadly speaking
 
00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 align:start position:0%
um what i want to do is i'm going to ask
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
cassie if she would talk a little bit
 
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
about the division of personnel
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
this is my attempt to make sure that our
 
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
presentation is not
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
completely boring and that i'm doing all
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
of the talking but
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
um she'll talk about the current
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
pressure that division of personnel is
 
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.950 align:start position:0%
pressure that division of personnel is
under

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
on slide six good morning
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
good morning um we have a central
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
personnel office it's called the
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
division of personnel
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
and they support some central functions
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
including recruitment hiring and
 
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
including recruitment hiring and
training

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
it also includes our employee relations
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
office and they uh
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
they negotiate with our employee unions
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
and now uh we're up to 11
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
unions and we run a self-funded bureau
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
of education and training
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i think there's two significant
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
things i would like to say about
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
um the division of personnel one is
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
is that um when commissioner arlinghaus
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
joined us uh he had direction from the
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
governor that we needed to
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
modernize our personnel system and um
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
we concur with that 100 and so we have
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
been working very hard
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
to develop central policies when
 
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
to develop central policies when
appropriate

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
and to support flexibility and speed so
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
that the agencies who are conducting the
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
business of state government
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
have their personnel needs met as
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
what's happened to the division of
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
personnel over the last
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
two years is so they've undergone a lot
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
of change they've had turnover in staff
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
they've had retirements and
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
um when the when the budget that we're
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
currently in
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
was passed um we had a very significant
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
lapse requirement and then
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
what happened i i believe it's just a
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
matter of timing they had vacancies that
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
came across
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
came along because of retirement people
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
switching jobs
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
and they were very very detrimental to
 
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
and they were very very detrimental to
them

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
not only doing their day-to-day business
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
but doing the personnel system reform
 
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.749 align:start position:0%
but doing the personnel system reform
that

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
we believe is necessary so when you look
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
at this slide we have
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
um we have bundle number two which
 
00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:41.590 align:start position:0%
um we have bundle number two which
includes

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
three full-time positions in one one um
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
one part-time position and these
 
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.309 align:start position:0%
one part-time position and these
positions

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
are critical to deliver
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
hr services to our agencies with the
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
speed that they need to recruit to
 
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.230 align:start position:0%
speed that they need to recruit to
retain

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
to manage their employees and to also do
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
that reform work that we talked about
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
in this budget um by the way we have
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
completely converted the bureau of
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
education and training
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
to a um income-based model
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
so there are no general funds supporting
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
the bureau of education
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
um and that's a departure from the
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
current budget
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
so i think that um some
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
summer summarizes the uh division of
 
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.430 align:start position:0%
summer summarizes the uh division of
personnel

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
two other things i would i want to point
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
out uh because people will remember this
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh first of all transitioning bet to a
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
to a tuition-based model
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
instead of general fund supported when
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
it used to be roughly 50 50
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
is no small accomplishment and i want to
 
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.110 align:start position:0%
is no small accomplishment and i want to
um

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
and and i say that having had nothing to
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
do with it myself that
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
the people who work for us um did a
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
really good job on it
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
and um and it was hard it was difficult
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
particularly in this climate
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
um that we're in but it's a it's a big
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
thing and it's a direction we could
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
receive from the governor's office
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
um there are two other pieces people
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
remember the last budget we were
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
required to do
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
by house bill 2 house before i guess um
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
a personnel report on on modernizing the
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
system reforming the system
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
um because it people know that the
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
system itself
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
is an enormous source of frustration to
 
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:24.950 align:start position:0%
is an enormous source of frustration to
uh

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
agencies the thing i hear most from
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
other commissioners about are personnel
 
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.189 align:start position:0%
other commissioners about are personnel
matters

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean discipline i mean uh
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
can i re-class
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
how does this can we is this possible
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
what is the rule for
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it's complicated and our the idea is
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
to make it more modern and functional
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
um we did a report on that that which
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
came out probably a year ago at this
 
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.829 align:start position:0%
came out probably a year ago at this
point

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
um the second thing is in that budget
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
was a comp study
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
um we did an initial small version for
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
troopers because of a a second special
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the um in house bill 4 i think as
 
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
in the um in house bill 4 i think as
well

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
but one of the things house bill 4
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
called for was a
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
study of the state's system of
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
compensation and total compensation
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh with comparators to private and
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
public sector that report was placed on
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
hold during the
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
um early stages of the pandemic for well
 
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.110 align:start position:0%
um early stages of the pandemic for well
for

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
for quite some time because frankly if
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
we were in a climate where we were going
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
to have to lose
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know 10 to 15 percent of the state
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
budget it was an area that was probably
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
not happen because it was you know
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
something we weren't doing today we
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
um when that seemed like it was not
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to be the case when some of the
 
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
going to be the case when some of the
spending

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
spending
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
restraints were lifted we we did it not
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
because we
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
we thought it was a good idea or a bad
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
idea but we did it because we're
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
required to do it by house bill 4. that
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
will probably be released i know i saw a
 
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.790 align:start position:0%
will probably be released i know i saw a
draft

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
um early this week or late last week i
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
don't know recently
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
and that will probably be released in
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
short order and i know that's something
 
00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:57.190 align:start position:0%
short order and i know that's something
that

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
the this committee talked about two
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
years ago as well
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i want you to know that that's out
 
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
so i want you to know that that's out
there

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
so charlie i have two questions and one
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
the report
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
how did you guys account for in the
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
report some of our positions are 37.5
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
hours a week as opposed to private
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
industry which is
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
40 hours a week so when you're doing a
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
salary comparison how did you
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
work that out well you can um you know
 
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.509 align:start position:0%
work that out well you can um you know
we

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
obviously we heard a consultant who does
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of comp studies and a lot of
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
public sector comp studies
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
um on this and it's um uh
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
you just you just um make an allowance
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
for that that it's
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know 37 and a half is 37.5 divided
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
by 40 of
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
40 hours and that's the easiest way to
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
do that um
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
there are intangibles in any sort of
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
compensation system where you look at
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
things and you say
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know are you putting a premium what
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
premium are you putting on on
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know this perk or this benefit all
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
we can really do
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
is look at uh you know convert things to
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
an hourly compensation rate look at what
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
benefits are
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
look at you know for example if you work
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
you get on average um
 
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.670 align:start position:0%
you get on average um
[Music]

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the number anymore 15
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
to 20 more days off
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
than you do if you work in the in the
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
private sector they're also comparators
 
00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:15.910 align:start position:0%
private sector they're also comparators
to

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
to state and local government or to
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
local government
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
um that's not necessarily something you
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
can account for financially so
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of things you can you can attach a
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
financial number to some things though
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
are intangible and so there's a
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
qualitative as opposed to quantitative
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
component to the report as well i think
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
all right second question
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
bundle two all general fund positions i
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
know this is um
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
you just talked about this as a mixture
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
of income based plus
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
general funds no it's all general fund
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
all your fun thank you
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
please continue unless somebody has a
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
question right now i don't see any
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
others you're doing good
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
oh i should look at the screen you're
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
not being lectured you're not being
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
chastised then you can answer all the
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
questions see
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
i'm eat i'm i'm eager to be lectured and
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
chastised when i need to be though
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
just for the record um
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um and i would point out
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
that there are page numbers at the top
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
of each slide there are the page numbers
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
that correspond to this if you want to
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
look at specific accounting units
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
when i say that thank you i say that
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
because plant and property is about to
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
which has more accounting units than a
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
we manage buildings we manage four
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
million square feet of office space we
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
manage something like 90 buildings
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
depending on what you count as a
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
building and
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh and then a bunch of leased space as
 
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.069 align:start position:0%
uh and then a bunch of leased space as
well

00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
um particularly in the bureau of court
 
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
um particularly in the bureau of court
facilities

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
um courts are done sort of separately
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
from everything else but
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
um this particular division
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
um includes a great deal of transfers
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
from other agencies so
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
so we do the work uh the money's in our
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
budget but it's also transferred from
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
from other agencies i will tell you that
 
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.069 align:start position:0%
from other agencies i will tell you that
um

00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
that uh i i had a i had a meeting with
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
with uh with matt mayo the the the
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
governor's new budget director
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
the one of those things about you know
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
what do you have any pieces of advice to
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
give him and what little advice i could
 
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.949 align:start position:0%
give him and what little advice i could
give

00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
i said if you're going to build a budget
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
there are two things you have to do at
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the budget process
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
if you're building a statewide budget
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
one is settle doit
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
because they affect every other agency's
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
budget lines yeah we didn't get that
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
done very well
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
well we're working on it there's some
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
work i haven't told don't
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't preview anything i haven't told
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
joe yet okay
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
the uh and the other thing is plant and
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
property because the other thing that
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
affects a lot of agency budgets is the
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
plant and property number
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's a number in their budget there's
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
a number in our budget it's
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's double counting but it's double
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
counting because it's it's accounting
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
for the cost to that agency
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then the money being spent here by
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
the people who do the work
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's why you see this as general funds
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
and other funds in the chart
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
on slide seven shows a significant
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
transfer from other agencies
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
some of those transfers come as general
 
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.509 align:start position:0%
some of those transfers come as general
funds

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
for example the courts entirely
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
other funds in our budget entirely
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
general funds in their budget
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
um so that's there so on this page
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and fiscal year 23
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
are basically flat funded when compared
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
with adjusted authorized for fiscal year
 
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.670 align:start position:0%
with adjusted authorized for fiscal year
21.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
21.
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
you have enough you believe you have
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
enough to do what you have to do to
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
yeah ish um now we ask the tough
 
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:42.310 align:start position:0%
yeah ish um now we ask the tough
question

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's um so
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
um the way we manage property in the
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is an
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing base but if you doubled the
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
budget we would spend the money
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's um you know you you walk around the
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
buildings of the state and there are
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
some buildings that are
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
a or b buildings if you will um i met uh
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
karen rantamaki is the director of
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
planet property now when she was deputy
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
and steve laurenson was here
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
i sat down with them once and i said
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
before steve leaves
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
because he can do this because he's
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
leaving um do me a favor go through our
 
00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
leaving um do me a favor go through our
buildings

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
say what's an a what's a b what's a c
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
what's a d we didn't we decided nothing
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
was an f
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that was probably right um
 
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.230 align:start position:0%
and i think that was probably right um
just

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
generally and we you know we had two
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
buildings there i think that were a's or
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
maybe three
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and there are a lot of buildings that
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
are b's and c's and so what you do is
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
you look around and you go okay we can't
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
well we could fix that and i don't know
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's not critical and that's like well
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
the carpeting how's the carpeting look
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's a little threadbare but there are
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
no tripping hazards okay
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so everything we do is uh it's
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
actually not a bad
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
analogy for the rest of what we do as an
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
agency um
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
you fix the tripping hazards first and
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
you don't worry as much about what's
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
threadbare as long as it's functional
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so you know we have a deferred
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance list
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
that um i have one sitting on the corner
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
of my desk
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
i don't have the i want it's about a
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
year old but it was
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
basically uh maintenance staff walking
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
around all the buildings
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
with with an ipad like writing stuff
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
down and they wrote most of the things
 
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.150 align:start position:0%
down and they wrote most of the things
down

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a hundred percent correct
 
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
it's not a hundred percent correct
because

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
if you've got a deferred maintenance
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
list that would cost about 100 million
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
dollars to fix
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
and you know you're going to fix about 2
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
million of it next year
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
you just got to get the big stuff on the
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
list and and that's what we do
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i think i think most buildings and
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
the maintenance fund two years ago was a
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
huge step in this direction to fix
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
the things that are most needy as
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to in the accounting units that
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
have money
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have enough money to take care of the
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
buildings in a big way presumably we can
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
we can hire in the current climate
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
um uh workers at a number of levels um
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
but we have enough money to do a decent
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
job not a
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
not a great job and and it's you know
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's the state of new hampshire you have
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
i don't need to tell you this but you
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
have eight million priorities that are
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
coming to you
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to be able to fund
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
half of them and
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it is so this is a
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
decent number i
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think plant and property was um um
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
is is reasonably adequately staffed at
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
this number
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's good to know um
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
so on the other hand if you got
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
some money you're not sure what to do
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
with uh yeah i can fix some stuff
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
we need to cut 79 million don't okay
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
um i would not cut 79 million out of
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
here that's all i'm saying
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
um if you want to turn to page two of or
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
plan property slide which is slide eight
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
in your deck
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
if you will um
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
i talk about a couple of house bill two
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
provisions here
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
um that are probably gonna require at
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
least a little bit of discussion
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
the steam heating account is just
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
updating those numbers
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
people will remember that when concord's
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
team closed and we did a massive project
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
to convert
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
to convert a bunch of buildings i think
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
it was 40 separate projects
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
or something like that it's just it's
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
just finishing up but one of the
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
requirements of that is the seven
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars in
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars was taken out of
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
operating costs um
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
in a bill in i'm gonna say roughly march
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
of 2017
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
and about seven million dollars was
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
bonded and the requirement was that the
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
savings are used to pay for the so we
 
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.430 align:start position:0%
savings are used to pay for the so we
budget

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
the steem portion of class 23
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
at farewell correct me when i say
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
something stupid that's why she's here
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that i don't say as many
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
stupid things okay
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
we budget uh the steam portion of class
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
23 at the number it would have been
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
and the money that we're spending which
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
is less than that we
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
used to pay off the debt service it's
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
transferred to what's called
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
the state heating system steam account
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
which is so we're talking about for
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
people who are looking at their hb2 at
 
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.710 align:start position:0%
people who are looking at their hb2 at
home

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about section two which
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
starts at the bottom of page one
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
and continues on to page two
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
and that you basically are asking us in
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
this section
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
to extend um
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
extend the timeline shall be non-lapsing
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the department of admin
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
services for the biennium
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
ending june 30th 2021 and the fiscal
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
year ending
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
the money is then set in an account and
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's available for the treasurer to use
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
at the time they deem
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
necessary based on when they issue bonds
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative burge thank you for
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
your presentation
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
just a question on on this page
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned uh sheriff custody what
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
oh that's the next thing i was going to
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
talk about and so if you look in
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
hb2 again you're now looking at
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
section 1 which is on top of the
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
steam section so you're on the same page
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
if you open your hb2
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
you got yours and you can see so charlie
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
so um sheriff sheriff custody
 
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.669 align:start position:0%
so um sheriff sheriff custody
reimbursements

00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursements
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not going to say um as much
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
on this because i think
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative ober knows a lot more
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
about it than i do but
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
um we pay for for
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
um sheriff custody of prisoners we
 
00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:40.870 align:start position:0%
um sheriff custody of prisoners we
reimburse

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
reimburse
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's no reason this is in our budget
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
except that it has to be somewhere
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any control over it
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't manage
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
it per se because we don't do the
 
00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
it per se because we don't do the
custody

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
custody
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
but there are so there are costs we
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
budget a number every year
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature the state budgets a
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
number every year
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
and um and it's never quite as much as
 
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
and um and it's never quite as much as
the

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
costs um and so what we did with this
 
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.230 align:start position:0%
costs um and so what we did with this
line

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
we budgeted a number that's you know our
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
budget went down 15
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this number went down 15 that's it no
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
no real thought process in that and
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
except just lowering
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
it and then we were talking about it and
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
i said we should
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
have some sort of a you know this
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be first come first served
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
right that
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
we just have a have a run to the finish
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
line and and
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
you get your request in first you get
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
the money and then suddenly we're out
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
and nobody gets any more
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
so uh i came up with a formula based on
 
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.990 align:start position:0%
so uh i came up with a formula based on
simplicity

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
simplicity
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
it did not anything complicated more
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
complicated than that and said all right
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
every county
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
gets reimbursements let's decide that
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
you know if you're three percent of the
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
population of the state you get three
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
percent of
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
whatever money ends up being
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
appropriated and
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know the same process you got to
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
get you got to go through you got to get
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursed you got to do the work but
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's the cap when you hit that number
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're done and that's just
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
and i picked population because it was
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's an available statistic
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not wedded to it yes you have more
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
questions yeah follow-up uh i mean that
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
seems to work in theory but
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
i live in colorado county the largest
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
county in the state
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work for kawasaki you know
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
we're always short
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think so right now everybody's always
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
i think so right now everybody's always
short

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
right that's uh because the the amount
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated is not as much as is spent
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
and the question is i think the question
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
is how do we
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
how do i phrase this how do we short
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
people equitably
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
um maybe population isn't the right
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
frayed but if we're going to short
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
everybody what's the
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
what's the best mechanism for prorating
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
road mileage might be a thing i don't
 
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
road mileage might be a thing i don't
know

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think counties track that
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
it it is although i to be honest i'm not
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
exactly sure how you would
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
like what road mileage from where to
 
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:17.029 align:start position:0%
like what road mileage from where to
where

00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not by the way i'm not well
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
no we can we can debate this by road
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge i mean if
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
the number of roads that you have in
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
your county
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh i mean coast county is not
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
noted for
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
its um you know super highways no that's
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
right we talked about that
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
um class one two three four five and six
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
so more five and six than other counties
 
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.590 align:start position:0%
so more five and six than other counties
do

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm okay uh personally with anything
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
anything you come up no that that makes
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
sense based on the
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's something where i would i
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
would turn to
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature because you are the
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
county delegations
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
um to come up with what you think and
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
you have a much better idea how it
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
works which which
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
metrics if you will uh approximate your
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
operating costs
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we put in uh population as a
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
placeholder so
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
i have no what's the right phrase i have
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
no dog in this fight
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
i know in coast county large county has
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
roughly 31 000 people
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
oh i see and so you're saying your costs
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
because of the distance they have to
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
travel is higher
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
but your population is smaller that's
 
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
but your population is smaller that's
that

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's a fair point okay thank you yeah
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
but i'd support whatever you think is
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
fair you'll have to come up with a
 
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.070 align:start position:0%
fair you'll have to come up with a
suggestion

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's what he's saying he's given it
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
the best shot
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to work on i got that
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
loud and clear
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay are you looking for suggestions and
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
anything well at this point all i'm
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
saying is that if you're gonna
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna appropriate a number
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to be less than is spent
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
we should have some mechanism for for
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
for deciding
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
how much everybody gets relative to
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
birds those are actually
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
lines 22 through 28 on page one
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
and it's no longer in his hands it's in
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
our hands
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
we would have to if we're going to amend
 
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.190 align:start position:0%
we would have to if we're going to amend
that

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
and commissioner arlen house has done
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
the best he can but now he's out of the
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
so he's explaining he's telling you he's
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
hearing what you're saying
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
no no that's fine um
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay that's plantar property um any
 
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:39.430 align:start position:0%
okay that's plantar property um any
other

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
plant property i should look at the
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
computer in front of me
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
good morning charlie hi you had a fairly
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
aggressive program over at the
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
gallon park last couple years as far as
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
rehabbing buildings
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
are you still rehabbing any buildings or
 
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
are you still rehabbing any buildings or
everything

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
kind of done over there i i think
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
everything isn't done so people will
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
know that if you think of the gallon
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
office park
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
or the sops camp as we call it sometimes
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
a 2005-ish
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
master plan for the site which is sort
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
of being followed
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
there is a there's sort of a continual
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
effort to fix
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
bits of the inside of buildings and to
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
rehab some uh major buildings we
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
i think right now the biggest projects
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
on the capital budget list
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
are preserving um
 
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.470 align:start position:0%
are preserving um
[Music]

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
not phil brook the victorian building
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
next to the main building
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
i can't remember its name i do this all
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
the time i always want to say phil brook
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
and it's not
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
um but uh we're we're preserving that
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
building that that giant victorian
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
building right there
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
um from the weather um there are some
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
internal things happening in maine
 
00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.350 align:start position:0%
internal things happening in maine
building

00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
but they tend to be more i don't say
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
cosmetic um they tend to be more
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know sort of safety and stabilizing
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
this area in that area
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
we're tearing down some things the old
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
concrete steam plant which is behind
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
maine sort of toward the garage and
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
warehouse and
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
the laundry facility that's being torn
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
down um
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
well the whole thing's being torn down
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
although i think the stack is still half
 
00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:22.389 align:start position:0%
although i think the stack is still half
up

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
um and then an area in there there's a
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's a handicap accessibility being
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
built and um
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
handicap accessibility and i think a
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
stairway in the very so
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
main building the big building on top of
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
the hill has all kinds of wings and
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
tentacles to it
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
some of them are was that walker
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
walker is the big one on the corner sort
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
of backed by the high school it's sort
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
of at the corner of state and fruit
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's walker's actually one of the
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
nicest buildings in the state which is
 
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.389 align:start position:0%
nicest buildings in the state which is
beautiful

00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
beautiful
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
um but you come forward from that and
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
and maine is
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
if you go in the regular entrance big
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
scary building
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
yeah the big scary building right it's
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
where you know it's not the only
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
building with ghosts but supposedly
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's where the ghosts are
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
um and there's some really bad spots in
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
the basement like if you take the tour
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
yeah you don't want to know what
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
happened there i asked somebody once and
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
i go don't ask questions you don't want
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
to hear the answer to um
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
and um so they're poor parts of that
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
that probably will never be fixed like
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
the kent wing
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
and the peasley wing might have some
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
structural issues with it but it might
 
00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:26.630 align:start position:0%
structural issues with it but it might
not

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
um but we do a little bit at a time but
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of major
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
giant rehab bancroft is the building i
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
was trying to think of
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
bancroft is probably the only remaining
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
building that's going to undergo a mass
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
undergo a significant expansion that
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
will then
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
create additional state office space
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
which will allow you not to
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
have to lease space the the theory is
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
when they when they develop the program
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
you know starting 20 years ago the idea
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
was to gradually move as many people
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
into state spaces
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
instead of least space as possible and a
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
lot of that was accomplished
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
it won't be entirely because if you
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
think of dncr they're leasing space on
 
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:07.909 align:start position:0%
think of dncr they're leasing space on
the

00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
heights on chanel drive i think and
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
they're probably never going to come
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
into state space they're just
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know unless we built a building
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
because there's not you know
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
we got little bits here and little bits
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
there we don't have much extra
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
i mean i you know use this as an example
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion internally about
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
moving somebody who's in one area well
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
closer to these people and they're like
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'm like yeah let's move them
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
where exactly and uh
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't come up with a well if
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
these people move and then those people
 
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.110 align:start position:0%
these people move and then those people
move

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then what if agriculture we just
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
kicked out of the building entirely
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
great okay where would they go oh
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
nowhere okay so that doesn't work and so
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
you end up starting over
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
but so the campus a lot there are things
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
happening but right now
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is operational stuff oxygen
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
systems in the laundry
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
um building for example there's
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
something on our list right now
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
all right thanks thanks what's happened
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
with the old steam building
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
so the old scene building has we did a
 
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.350 align:start position:0%
so the old scene building has we did a
significant

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
which was really a little bit scary
 
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.430 align:start position:0%
which was really a little bit scary
because

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
not everybody operates the same way uh
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
generally speaking you shouldn't have a
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
giant plastic
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
gallon jug of mercury just hanging out
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
under the stairs unmarked
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
oh my god as an example um
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
but um but we took care of that so we
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
took care of everything so that
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
um now it's being torn down and but to
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
tear it down you need to
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
clean it out first so that that doesn't
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
all become hazardous waste
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
and it is about i would say the
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
demolition project which is a capital
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
budget item in the
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
2021 capital budget is about half done
 
00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:54.310 align:start position:0%
2021 capital budget is about half done
okay

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
um half the stack came down because it
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
started doing a pisa kind of thing oh
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
dear which you don't want
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
and so we uh we hired the boston chimney
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
company this is like a
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
really cool name i think for a company
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
boston chimney and tower
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think they're called i thought i want
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
to work for a company with a name like
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
that it just seems very solid
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
um so i'm sorry i digress
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
um well
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll ask you to repeat that to
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
my wife um
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
division of procurement and support
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
services we buy stuff
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
um it's a little more complicated than
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
that and i think gary's probably
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
listening and
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
um he would dispute that that's that's
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
what they do is they buy stuff but
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking you know we we bid
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of things and there are other
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
services fleet management is done out of
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
the state agency
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
it also includes surplus property where
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
the state unlike the federal government
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
actually sells its surplus property
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
rather than giving it away
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
and we make a buck off it um white farm
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
is where most of that happens uh
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have a surplus food distribution
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
network that goes out of this
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
graphic services the state central
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
graphic services function is out of here
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
we manage the fleet we manage uh
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
merchant cards which is when people
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
pay us we manage procurement cards which
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
is when we pay people
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
um this agency is um
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
well i'm very proud of them i should say
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic there's probably
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
you know our agency has been hit pretty
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
hard by the pandemic not because people
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
got it but because
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're we work on stuff and everybody
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
gets repurposed you know the we set up a
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
warehouse and
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
and you know gary's got gary lynette as
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
the director gary's got a couple of
 
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.350 align:start position:0%
the director gary's got a couple of
people

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
um who are basically 100 repurposed to
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
manage the warehouse
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
we don't manage warehouses that's not
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
something we do we don't do inventory
 
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
something we do we don't do inventory
control

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
exactly but somebody had to so we did it
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
two uh two very good chris and don
 
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.029 align:start position:0%
two uh two very good chris and don
actually

00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
are their names they're doing that about
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
we did an analysis and about
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
a little over 40 percent of their time
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
has been spent repurposed to
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
covidien sort of activities um so
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
they've been hit pretty hard on that
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
but they're managing to do everything
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
anyway so these are these are great
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
people making sure that when we buy
 
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.669 align:start position:0%
people making sure that when we buy
stuff

00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
we buy it at a good price and that we
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
that we have a legal contract so that if
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
they don't deliver we don't pay
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
and that's true of that's true of road
 
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.269 align:start position:0%
and that's true of that's true of road
salt

00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
salt
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
and it's true of n95 masks and from the
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
beginning they stepped up and said
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're not just going to call some guy in
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
china and go send us what you got we'll
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
send you a check and
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
we don't worry about whether we get it
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
or not we make sure that the flow and
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
everything is there they do a great job
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
um they're down a lot of people because
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
this is you know cassie talked a little
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
bit before about
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
um the tyranny of retirements where
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
somebody retires that's open
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the open position is the easiest to
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
eliminate um
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a bundle here three
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
full time and one part time
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
it it helps purchasing everybody
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
everybody this is a trend uh a theme i
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
think you'll run into
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
in our agency everybody needs to be
 
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.230 align:start position:0%
in our agency everybody needs to be
cross-trained

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
cross-trained
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
um sarah and i have a monthly meeting
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
about about finance
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
and one of the big things that comes up
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
in that meeting is
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
how many people know how to do payroll
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
it can't just be one
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's got to be everybody how many people
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
know how to do ar how many people need
 
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.669 align:start position:0%
know how to do ar how many people need
to

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
know how to do ap how many people know
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
how to do pick something
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
and and that's what's happening in
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
gary's agency it used to be that i only
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
do commodity buying nope
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
everybody buys everything even if you
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
specialize in something
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
everybody buys everything we can we can
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
cover each other
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's been great right
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
now because for example
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
we had the fleet manager position open
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
for about a year because of the
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze and all of that and the
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
guy who did p-cards
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
also did fleet it's not his job
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
but he did it because somebody had to
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
and they step up um
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's a point though at which
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
you can't keep doing that anymore that's
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
why we have a bundle of positions here
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
charlie before we go on you've got a
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
line here
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
graphic services established as a
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
revolving fund and page
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
110 to 112 and hb1 we also have sections
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
in hb2 related to that
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
could you go through that and then
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative burj is going to have a
 
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.190 align:start position:0%
representative burj is going to have a
question

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
sure graphic services
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
is three accounting units in your budget
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
and on page one
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
ten to one there's graphic services
 
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.190 align:start position:0%
ten to one there's graphic services
administration

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
and then there's let me get it in front
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
of me photocopy and print shop
 
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
of me photocopy and print shop
operations

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
yep um and that's sort of a holdover
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
from a day when those were different
 
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.630 align:start position:0%
from a day when those were different
things

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
we live in a world where they aren't
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
exactly different things anymore right
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
the the line between
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
how can we organize this so it matches
 
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.950 align:start position:0%
how can we organize this so it matches
today

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
sarah just fainted because that's
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
something she has to do nevermind
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
we could we could actually look at doing
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
that it might make sense
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
so two of these this is the
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
administration is the general funds
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
and the two operation pieces are
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds they are
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
um people pay for their people pay for
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
their copies people pay for their
 
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.109 align:start position:0%
their copies people pay for their
printing

00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
printing
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
and they're meant to cover themselves
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
and they do
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
essentially every year there's a there's
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit left over at the end of
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
every year we keep we're not
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're not meant to spend more than is
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
left over um and it varies usually from
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
between 13
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
000 and i think in the low in the last
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
five years and something like
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
60 000 is the high in that range um
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
where does that money go well right now
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
it lapses
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
till the general fund goes to like this
 
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.150 align:start position:0%
till the general fund goes to like this
year

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
it would go to the general fund it would
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
pay off
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't pay off anything it would go
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
to you not you it would it would come
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
fund as a lapse so what you're proposing
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'm proposing to not do that anymore and
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
here's why
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and we we could cap it if we wanted
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
to but
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money that makes it i
 
00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money that makes it i
think

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
the salary adjustment fund we have a
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
salary adjustment fund in the state
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
when people retire so we budget we
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
we budget people's salaries people's
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
benefits in the state
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
when they retire typically they get a
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
large payout if you've been here
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
five or six years it's not that large if
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
you've been here 30 or 40 is quite large
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
and agencies have the ability for
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
generally funded positions
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
to go to the salary adjustment fund to
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's meant to cover that it's meant to
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
be the the excess it's swept out
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
and then used to pay that more than
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
um you can't do that with dedicated
 
00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.150 align:start position:0%
um you can't do that with dedicated
funds

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
so you know normally this doesn't come
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
up much because it's not a lot of money
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
there aren't that many people
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
graphic services is apparently the one
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the greatest places to work in state
 
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.190 align:start position:0%
of the greatest places to work in state
government

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
i got people there this is a story when
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
i started as commissioner i did a tour
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
of buildings
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
and and everybody where we have people
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
working i wanted to try to meet
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
essentially everybody who worked for the
 
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.870 align:start position:0%
essentially everybody who worked for the
department

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
i at most everybody and some of the
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
prisoners um
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i go over the graphic services i'm
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
talking to people i'm on the print shop
 
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.190 align:start position:0%
talking to people i'm on the print shop
floor

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking to a guy brian is his
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
name he's actually retired since but
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
brain cummings
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and i'm like oh how long you've been
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
here and he said you know 41 years
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
like holy cow 41 years he goes yeah and
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not even the senior guy on the floor
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
and he points across the room to dave
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
roy is the guy's name has been there 46.
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
he's pushing 50 years now
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
and by the way 46 47 years
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
same room same print shop
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
same place i mean god bless him does
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
great work and he's wonderful
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
by the way when he retires it's a big
 
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.630 align:start position:0%
by the way when he retires it's a big
number

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
well if it's a general fund you go to
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
the salary adjustment fund
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're not setting aside money for that
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
and we can't set aside money for that
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
because there's no
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
because it's not that so in our agency
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
surplus property is a revolving fund
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
surplus food is a revolving fund largely
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
because of the federal component
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
and so that's why on page two it says
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
establish a state treasury a graphic
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
services fund which shall
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
shall be resolving fund administrated by
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
the department of
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
administrative services the funds will
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
be non-lapsing
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
and you're going you it goes on to talk
 
00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:54.630 align:start position:0%
and you're going you it goes on to talk
about

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the next section necessary costs of
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
administration management operations
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
activities etc
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
so that's what you're talking about
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
doing with this money
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
what's that for these people yep
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay anybody got a question on that
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
representative burge you had your hand
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
up and i think you were just
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
slightly farther down on that so go to
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
you were on the same page
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
i was reading ahead thank you my
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
question goes back to
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing when you purchase an item you
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
put it out for bid
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh in taking that into consideration do
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
you always go for the bottom line or do
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
you take
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
quality into account because in the long
 
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.030 align:start position:0%
quality into account because in the long
run

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
run
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
the quality is in there it'll cost you
 
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.069 align:start position:0%
the quality is in there it'll cost you
more

00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's um you know it's a it's a really
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
good point and um you know there are
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
perils of low bid bidding
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
um it depends on the
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
it depends on the product and i'm going
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
to use a couple of examples so if you
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
think about something like uh like a
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
commodity like road salt
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
road salt is a great example we recently
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
did we actually did a reverse auction
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
which is a little bit like name neptune
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
if you're old enough to remember the
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
name neptune i can buy i can pay 23
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
cents for that salt oh yeah i can do it
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
for 22.
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
um and we we did that you save a little
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
money that way because road salt is road
 
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.109 align:start position:0%
money that way because road salt is road
salt

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
salt
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's not technically true i i
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
understand but as long as you say
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
we need this this this this and uh
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's a technical component that i'll
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
get lost on but it has to be you know
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
this percentage of that or whatever but
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
as long as you meet that threshold well
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
if you meet a threshold
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
so what we'll do with things like office
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
supplies let's say
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
is we'll write a standard for what we
 
00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:31.349 align:start position:0%
is we'll write a standard for what we
want

00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
not any paper towel you come up with but
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
the paper towel has got to meet this
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
standard and the standard in this
 
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.150 align:start position:0%
standard and the standard in this
standard

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
then you bid on it so that we're bidding
 
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.309 align:start position:0%
then you bid on it so that we're bidding
apples

00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
apples
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
and they're we're biting both sides of
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
the equation
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
nobody's trying to voice off on you
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
macintoshes or something
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and so the the bid spec
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
will have a great deal of detail and it
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
depends a little bit on
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
the product or the uh process that's
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
being bid services are bid to and what
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
service are you bidding
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
so quality can be taken into
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
consideration like when we do a
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
construction project
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
these are multi-million dollar bids the
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
the specs are just
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know uh page after page after page
 
00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
you know uh page after page after page
that

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
that you and i or at least i anyway just
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't understand and we have
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
engineers who walk through it and
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
consultants to go through it you have to
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
meet those standards
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
and on a more complicated thing like a
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
construction project well we'll talk
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
about this later but
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
we actually then follow up to make sure
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
you're you're not giving us
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
you you didn't you're not giving it a
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
supply would instead of two by fours
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a good point uh uh
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair because the
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
um buying things is a lot harder than
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
people think
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot more complicated than
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
people think and um
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
for those for those reasons because
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise you you know if you're not
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
good at it you can get had
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
pretty easy okay so charlie you've also
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
got section three
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
related to the division of
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
procurement support services and hp2
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
which is on page two
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
section three so this is p
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
cards the the p card
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
or procurement card was established uh
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
five six seven years ago as a as a test
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
we buy things with a credit card
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
it used to be we bought a lot of stuff
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
with field purchase orders which are
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
have very little accountability
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh as a test we started buying
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
things with the
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
with the credit card we get rebate
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
revenue on it um
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
a negotiated value uh the more you spend
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
the higher your rebate the more basis
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
points you get back so to speak
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
was commissioner that's bill i had
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored was that right yeah okay
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
so you've heard of this before then oh
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um the um
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't look to me like section
 
00:44:01.119 --> 00:44:02.069 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't look to me like section
three

00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
makes a big change you've just made this
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's a little change but i want you to
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
know what you're doing before i
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
before i pretend it's too little um
 
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.470 align:start position:0%
before i pretend it's too little um
currently

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
so p cards are getting bigger and bigger
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
and bigger and
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
it's not a side issue where you and and
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
the whole picard program was off budget
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't in the budget in the last
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
two or three budgets it's just off
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
budget but
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're not at the point where
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
occasionally we buy something with a
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
credit card
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
but pretty much we just write checks um
 
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.349 align:start position:0%
but pretty much we just write checks um
the

00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
the spend on that side of the house gets
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
larger and larger and we need to be in a
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
position where the controls on
 
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.670 align:start position:0%
position where the controls on
purchasing

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
are purchasing is purchasing how you pay
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
for it shouldn't matter
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
and um so the p card is i don't want to
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
be a stand-alone
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
set-aside i want it integrated into the
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
rest of the program
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a sub there's a
 
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:56.950 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a sub there's a
bureau

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
in procurement bureau purchasing
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
property where
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
we meld it in and the rebates are not
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
set aside into an off-budget account
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
that stands by itself
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're merely um part of
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
they pay for purchasing and the p-card
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
manager and the p-card assistant manager
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
are not separate stand-alone off-budget
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
people they're just in the budget
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
like everything else this is a change
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
does uh financially help us and and
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
is replaces general fund dollars with
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
rebate revenue
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
to a small extent i don't want to
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
overstate it but it's
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
on a net value it's maybe 60 grand
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
so for those who can't hear that was
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
sarah and she said
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
it varies from year to year on average
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's about 60.
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
um so um so it's a it's a slight net
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
benefit to the general fund
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
but slight well just so you know the
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
intent was
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
to start it as a pilot and if successful
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
to move it
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
and do exactly what you're doing well
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
good well look at that that's great
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
linda hodgson did not think it was going
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
so she was amenable to a pilot fund
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
well i would say i think the pilot would
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh turn out to be a good idea because we
 
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.430 align:start position:0%
uh turn out to be a good idea because we
took

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
took
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
i went i think we took a few years
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
getting a getting a handle on it and
 
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
getting a getting a handle on it and
it's

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
instituting controls around it you know
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things you want to make sure
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
you don't have people you know what the
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
right term is
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
thinking they're just running around
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
with a credit card but we have a very
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
a very strong control environment around
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you know rules and waivers and you
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
know what you can use it for and what
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
you can't so
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's actually worked out to be a
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
great success
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
um okay that's procurement
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
yep we're ready to move on public works
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
the division of public works we build
 
00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:53.670 align:start position:0%
the division of public works we build
stuff

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
um manage 160 million dollars worth of
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
projects they're about 120 active
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
projects in some stage of development
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's a rough number i don't have an
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
exact because what stage of development
 
00:47:05.119 --> 00:47:05.750 align:start position:0%
exact because what stage of development
is

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
is a question um public works um
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh are in the rsa's 21i
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
sections like 7980 and and in that
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
in that area um have some discussion of
 
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.870 align:start position:0%
in that area um have some discussion of
this

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
as an aside public works grows out of
 
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.069 align:start position:0%
as an aside public works grows out of
the

00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh and the regulations on it grow out of
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
the time when the only
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
only one of my predecessors to go to
 
00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:33.109 align:start position:0%
only one of my predecessors to go to
jail

00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
jail
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
at least that i'm aware of went to jail
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the 40s for
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
bid rigging essentially goofy
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
construction contracts that were not
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
very good he ended up doing federal time
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
um we don't do that anymore i'm not at
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
risk for going to jail
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
um at least i don't think i am um
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh but there are a lot of so the state
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
standards on buildings we have to follow
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
state standards on buildings
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
um when we build stuff we don't build
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
whatever is cheapest we
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh we come up with plans and design so
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
that you're not leaning
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
on a wall and it falls down and that you
 
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.109 align:start position:0%
on a wall and it falls down and that you
know

00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of styrofoam walls
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
in state buildings we build to uh
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
to what's uh i think it's a 35-year
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
standard i might get that wrong but
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
that's about right
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
um general fund
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
projects are generally funded and
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh and that work is done sort of
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
straight up on this
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh capital projects and um non-general
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
fund projects are by state law required
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
billed back to the agencies or build
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
back to the project is probably the
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
right way to put that
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
so that this unit has agency income to a
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
significant extent
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's about a third it goes up and down a
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
little bit each year depending on which
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
projects are approved
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
and and where they are so to speak in
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
the uh where the money is coming from
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
so bundle five are they all general fund
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
or are they
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
that mixture they're all that mix so
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
every position in that
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
every position in this agency is
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
budgeted at 63-37
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
um that's just every in the position
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
account whatever that thing is called
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
in the position module that that's how
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're listed in in the budget
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
um we're going to look at over time
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
how we budget positions i believe that
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
clerk of the works
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
so the three kinds of positions of
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
public works right there's the project
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
managers the engineer and the architect
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
the guy who writes the plans the guy who
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
is the working
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
um on um on developing the
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh the plans that we build from and then
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
works on that project and works with the
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
construction company on that
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
um they're project managers is what we
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
call them
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's four of the positions we're down
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
a bunch our only electrical engineer for
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
example retired
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
we're down a mechanical i think we're
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
down an electric a mechanical and an
 
00:49:52.319 --> 00:49:53.349 align:start position:0%
down an electric a mechanical and an
architect

00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
architect
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what the fourth is i
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a more entry level position
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of fungibility there
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
we tried to assign a project to the
 
00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:02.630 align:start position:0%
we tried to assign a project to the
people

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
the guy who works on boilers is a guy
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
who always works on boilers
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
um i think it's typically dave goulet
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
for example because he knows boilers
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
and and and we don't have caitlyn work
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
on boilers because she's an architect as
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
and so she works on so everybody has
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
like a you know who should this project
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
go to we'll probably put that one
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
with keith that kind of thing um that's
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
one piece there's a
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's a small sort of business
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
management staff which is the people who
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
make the paperwork go
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
and get all the things from the
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
contractors and then there's a
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
significant construction oversight when
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
you hear people talk about clerk of the
 
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.710 align:start position:0%
you hear people talk about clerk of the
works

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the works is a person on
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
the construction project who
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
who does um who make sure that we're
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
that stuff is working that that we they
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
used to talk about slump uh slump tests
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
but um concrete breaks
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
we pour concrete and they and then they
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
test them
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
periodically i'm doing this because i
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
had to learn about concrete breaks
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i desperately want to want to use
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
at some point and so this is my shot um
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
but we did that i mean it's they
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
actually when they pour the concrete
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
they do these you know
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
14 day 28 day and i think it's 56 day
 
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.309 align:start position:0%
14 day 28 day and i think it's 56 day
samples

00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
samples
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
which they then break to see if we got
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
the right concrete and if it doesn't
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
break right at the 14 day break we make
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
them take it out and put it in again
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
that sort of follow follow-up on the
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
project is critical
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
and it's it people remember i think
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
starting in 2013
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
probably there was additional language
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
put in the capital project
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
for us to make sure that on capital
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
projects that we are hiring
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
um clerks and that they can be paid for
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
out of the capital funds
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
and that's the billing um
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
we've gotten by with this level of
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
staffing just real quick we've gotten by
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
with this level of staffing for the last
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
year and a half
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
because people will know there was a
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget freeze most capital
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
projects were either not being done
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
not being started or slowed so that the
 
00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:59.750 align:start position:0%
not being started or slowed so that the
workload

00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
workload
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
for the first
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
nine to ten months of the state of
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
emergency was um
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh less i don't want to say nobody was
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
working because that's not remotely true
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
but we weren't pushing as many projects
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
forward because i think there was some
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of financial
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
uncertainty for the first six or eight
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
months of the
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the of the pandemic people weren't
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
sure if this was if there was going to
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
be a huge
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
um revenue collapse or not and so
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
projects were slow
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
um we only need the people if we're
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
going to build stuff
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i think we are going to build stuff
 
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.630 align:start position:0%
but i think we are going to build stuff
sorry

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
no no that's fine the uh i thought this
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
might be a good place to weigh in on the
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
steam building that was built and i
 
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.069 align:start position:0%
steam building that was built and i
think

00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
whoever was responding you're smiling
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
see must have something to do with the
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
architecture that i think it looks nice
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
what people um uh this
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
i don't actually know where we are but i
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
think it's the building right over there
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
actually over there uh by the police
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
station and sort of behind the
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
we built a steam house and instead of it
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
being an ugly monstrosity
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
made out of out of green cinder blocks
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
it's a brick building and by the way it
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't take much money
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure the building fits into its
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
surroundings and doesn't look like a
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
like a blight on the fabric of the city
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
of concord
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
um and we've got a lot of comments on
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
that the architect is actually from
 
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.910 align:start position:0%
that the architect is actually from
vermont

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh just a you know real good guy
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
and um and they made a huge effort and
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
it was uh
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
the only thing i had to do with it and
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm but i'm going to say this is i
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
insisted on reviewing the brick color
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
and which is really stupid but i was i i
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
like bricks
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to make sure we weren't
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
buying pink ones that we bought dark red
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's public works
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
and knowing that you're tired of hearing
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
me at this point keep talking
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask cassie to talk again
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
too see how i intro you cassie it's real
 
00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:04.950 align:start position:0%
too see how i intro you cassie it's real
nice

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
nice
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
um but we're going to talk about
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
financial data management the
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh most inappropriately named division
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
of our agency
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
because although that's what they do
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's so much more oh that's your line
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
isn't it did i steal that
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
so cassie keene is going to talk about
 
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.550 align:start position:0%
so cassie keene is going to talk about
fdm

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
fdm
 
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.309 align:start position:0%
fdm
[Music]

00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
hello again um the most
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
important role of fdm is that they
 
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.270 align:start position:0%
important role of fdm is that they
administer

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
administer
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire first which is our
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
business enterprise system
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
that is the backbone of state government
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
and it does
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
it manages every process you can think
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
of it manages
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
hr we we um if we hire somebody we put
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
them into the system
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
if they have a promotion if they
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
terminate and
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
all it manages every phase of the hr
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
process it manages our payroll and
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
produces our payroll
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
accounts payable accounts receivable and
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
also financial reporting
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so it's a very large undertaking and
 
00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.190 align:start position:0%
and so it's a very large undertaking and
as

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
charlie mentioned earlier there is a
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
proposal for us to move
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire first from an on-premise
 
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.309 align:start position:0%
new hampshire first from an on-premise
system

00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
to the cloud which we believe will
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
allow us to update the system more
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
regularly not get behind like we have in
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
and it's going to give our agencies a
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
ease and flexibility to customize
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
financial reporting
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
for their own needs which i think is
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
going to help agencies it's going to
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
help the legislature it's going to help
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
the chief executive um so so we're very
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
um like enthused about moving to the
 
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.630 align:start position:0%
um like enthused about moving to the
cloud

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
cloud
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
um there are four
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
different um increases in the fdm budget
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
and um one of those increases is for our
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
department-wide funding of the doit
 
00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:05.589 align:start position:0%
department-wide funding of the doit
budget

00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
and that is approximately 221 thousand
 
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.990 align:start position:0%
and that is approximately 221 thousand
dollars

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
there is increased debt over time
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
for um to allow staff to work overtime
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
to work on the cloud development
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
there is um an extra 200 000
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
that is to support um a das
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
department-wide um pc
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
replacement we found ourselves
 
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
replacement we found ourselves
shortchanged

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
shortchanged
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic hit first of all doit
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
has a standard where they recommend that
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
a pc be replaced every four years
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
we have nearly 250 computers that
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
exceed that age and when the pandemic
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
hit we had mostly desktops
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
we had some laptops and
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
so we had old equipment and we didn't
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
have equipment that was really
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
um flexible so the pandemic
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
taught us something so as we move
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward we want to get on a schedule
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
where we regularly budget in our budget
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
there's no highs and there's no
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
lows replacement pcs for our staff
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to move to a model where
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
we use laptops and docking stations so
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
that if a staff person
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
is working remotely they simply bring
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
their laptop home with them
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
um and if they come back into the office
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
they bring their laptop in and they plug
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
it in at their desk
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
and um there is also
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
a an increase in the fdm budget
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
for our vendor who is called
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
infor they actually run our
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire first system and there is
 
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:50.230 align:start position:0%
new hampshire first system and there is
an

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
annual maintenance increase in the
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
budget and that's directly related to
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
our scheduling project which um as
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
as representative over knows we're right
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
now in phase one and we're going to be
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
launching this month
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
um a scheduling initiative to support
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
the department of corrections
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it is it's a it's a mechanism
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually a couple different
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
things it
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
it provides efficiency and scheduling
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
of staff and also it allows staff to
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
punch in
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
and punch out very expeditiously using
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
like a key card kind of
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
system and it's going to give the
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
department of corrections a lot more
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
control about who's working where and
 
00:58:34.839 --> 00:58:36.470 align:start position:0%
control about who's working where and
when

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
and and next phases of another project
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
that's underway called strategic
 
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.150 align:start position:0%
that's underway called strategic
sourcing

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
and with we are short three positions in
 
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:45.910 align:start position:0%
and with we are short three positions in
the

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the current proposed budget to
 
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.270 align:start position:0%
in the current proposed budget to
support

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
fdn and it's bundle three and we
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned it earlier when we talked
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
about the bureau of accounts
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
um the interesting thing about new
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire first is
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
it is administered by fdm but it is
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
literally a system that requires
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
contributions from all over
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
our departments so um when i said
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
there's a module that helps support
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
hr our division of personnel is heavily
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
how is the new hampshire first meeting
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
personnel needs
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh financial reporting obviously bureau
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
of accounts is involved
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh payroll bureau of accounts so
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
there are three positions in bundle
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
three and and
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
those three positions would support the
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
initiative to move to the cloud
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
cassie does fdm have any
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
sections in hb2 it didn't seem to me
 
00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.549 align:start position:0%
sections in hb2 it didn't seem to me
that

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
any of those sections directly related
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
to fdm did i read those correctly
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
you did there is nothing in hospital ii
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
related to ftm
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
see no questions i bet you're going to
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
get to recontinue
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
with risk and benefits when we turn the
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
page somehow
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe um the uh the only thing i
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
want to say sarah did point out that
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
there's a section
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
about the continuation of the funding
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
for scheduling software in hvac
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
h7 thank you
 
01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
h7 thank you
representation

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
it is seven eight seven
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
line twenty four section thirty line
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
twenty four
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
so in the last budget um the last budget
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
included as as one of the operating
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh things instead of a capital thing
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
it if you remember two years ago there's
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of money in house bill 2
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
that was that was the equivalent of sort
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
of capital money but it was being spent
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
in hospital too there was a
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
there was an amount of money for the
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
scheduling process and we're not
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent sure if that's going
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
to be spent by june
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
30th or not but we're using it for the
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
for the project it might actually be
 
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.430 align:start position:0%
for the project it might actually be
close

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
so you would like to have a decision we
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
would like to have an extended in the
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the equivalent of a capital budget
 
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.549 align:start position:0%
in the equivalent of a capital budget
extension

01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks sarah for saving us
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
madam chair would it be okay if i asked
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
cassie to do the division of risk and
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
benefits as well i'm
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
so uh the next couple of slides relate
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
to division of risk and benefits and the
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
first slide which is number 12
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
really just talks about what is this
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
division of risk and benefits
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
and um i this this committee
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
representative ober are very very
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
our division of risk and benefits which
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
is led by director joyce pittman who has
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
done a wonderful wonderful job
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
sarah and i used to be a part of um risk
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
and benefits so it's near and dear to
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
our hearts
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
in any event we we administer the
 
01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:05.990 align:start position:0%
in any event we we administer the
employee

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the retiree health benefit plans and
 
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.190 align:start position:0%
and the retiree health benefit plans and
we

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
cover approximately 37 000 people
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
which is our employees and their
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
families and
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
our retirees and spouses generally
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
speaking we also in the division
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
of we we spend by the way about 600
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars in a biennium for health
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
care so the work that we do
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
to contain costs is um
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
one of our major goals it's it's i think
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
good for you folks to know that employee
 
01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.829 align:start position:0%
good for you folks to know that employee
benefits

01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
are defined by the collective bargaining
 
01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:46.710 align:start position:0%
are defined by the collective bargaining
agreements

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
and the legislature defines the
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
scope of the retiree health benefits so
 
01:02:52.799 --> 01:02:53.109 align:start position:0%
scope of the retiree health benefits so
we

01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
simply change benefits on our own again
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
we have to look to collective bargaining
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
into the legislature in the
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the case of retired health we also
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
secure property and casualty insurance
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
for state agencies and
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the bullet that we'll focus
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
on when we look at what's different
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
about this budget
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
and we administer the workers
 
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.710 align:start position:0%
and we administer the workers
compensation

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
program for the state of new hampshire
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
in this budget you're going to see some
 
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
in this budget you're going to see some
differences

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
differences
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
and it's an increase in total funds in
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
class 211
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
and um what we did is
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
budget in it's a i think it's a lot like
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
the buildings we budgeted in
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
more than more than 15 insurance
 
01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:50.710 align:start position:0%
more than more than 15 insurance
policies

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
and those policies are funded by
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
agencies and there's agency
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
income to support that expense
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
and we this is a change in in the
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
budgeting of the policies
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
how they're budgeted not the amount and
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
the reason we did this is that um
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
over the years we've come to realizing
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
risk that
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
we've been put in a position with our
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
scarce resources
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
of having to be a collection agency to
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
collect money from agencies and to make
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
sure that they're paying policies to the
 
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:24.950 align:start position:0%
sure that they're paying policies to the
carriers

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
who are ensuring the state of new
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire's interests and
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's a terribly inefficient policy way
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
to run a business
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
and so by moving the expense into
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
the risk budget where we in risk will be
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
able to pay those
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
carriers when do and we can
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
efficiently work with the agencies to
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
collect the revenue from them that
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
supports that expense
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
so um that's why you see a difference in
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
class 211
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
and representative ober in particular
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
we know we've talked about cyber
 
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
we know we've talked about cyber
insurance

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
um this is a general fund expense that's
 
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.109 align:start position:0%
um this is a general fund expense that's
been

01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
in the division of risk and benefits
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
since approximately 2015
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
it does cover cyber security
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
coverage for the entire state of new
 
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:19.910 align:start position:0%
coverage for the entire state of new
hampshire

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
all three branches the secretary of
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
state and the other constitutional
 
01:05:24.319 --> 01:05:25.510 align:start position:0%
state and the other constitutional
entities

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
and as i said it is a general fund
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
we did look at so people will know
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
that representative ober during the the
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
what do they call the governor's budget
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
hearings in
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
november i think said something to us
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
about hey why is that budgeted there as
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
general funds instead of
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh costs allocated like all the other it
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
expenses through
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
doit class 27 class 27.
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
so we looked at it because it but it was
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
already done
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
so it so the budget already done we
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
so the beginning of the governor's phase
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
we sort of talked about it but um
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
because it was already there um i think
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
where the governor's office was was
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
was they said if that can be done in the
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislative phase we're not opposed to
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
it but
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
we're not doing it yet right because
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
that would change every class 27 in
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
every agency
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
so we talked to dennis about it um
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
no don't joe doesn't know that so we uh
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
um if something comes up
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
where we're changing the class 27 in
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
every state
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
agency budget anyway um
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
then we might consider doing that at
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
that appropriate time
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
this amount just understand what cassie
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
said which i think was very clear
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
because she gives clear
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
clear descriptions would actually move
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
into class
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
211 yes
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
see cassie gives clear descriptions i
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay there you go there we go okay
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
so now retiree health where we see
 
01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:10.390 align:start position:0%
so now retiree health where we see
miraculously

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
lots of money the first time i said
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
cassie have to tell you the first time
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner said at the governor's
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
budget hearings in november that this
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
had gone down
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
my heart sank because i said to myself
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
how many retirees died because of covert
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
because i couldn't imagine how else it
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
um now we have a wild success story to
 
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.349 align:start position:0%
um now we have a wild success story to
tell

01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
tell
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i want to applaud and get on my
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
knees and thank the work of the division
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
of risk of benefits
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
because i think it's it's wonderful news
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
not only for
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
our department but for the state and for
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
you folks who are struggling in this
 
01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:51.829 align:start position:0%
you folks who are struggling in this
very

01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
hard fiscal time so um
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
we in 20 what what how can we attribute
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
this success
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
and we can we can attribute it to the
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
um transfer of the medical benefits for
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
medicare retirees not
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
not prescription drug by the way from
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
a self-funded model to a medicare
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
advantage model
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
we actually did this beginning in
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
2019 and we were under contract with
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
anthem for our medicare retirees and we
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
converted them from a self-funded model
 
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.149 align:start position:0%
converted them from a self-funded model
to

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
medicare advantage and what it did was
 
01:08:32.799 --> 01:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
medicare advantage and what it did was
it

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
it brought in federal funds that were
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
paid directly to the carrier who's
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
incentivized to coordinate care under
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
on behalf of retirees and that resulted
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
in substantial savings to the plan in
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
the current biennium
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
and so the first bullet you see on this
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
page you can see that we estimate a
 
01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.349 align:start position:0%
page you can see that we estimate a
lapse

01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
in general funds in the amount of 77
 
01:08:56.239 --> 01:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
in general funds in the amount of 77
million

01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 21 and we believe that
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
that lapse will go up to 10 million for
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
biennium then in 2020
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
we um that that contract with anthem
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
was um ending at 12 31
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
2020. so we did a procurement for a
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
medicare advantage
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
carrier for um
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
for our medicare retirees and we knew
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
what has happened in since we've been
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
retiree health a lot with this committee
 
01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.789 align:start position:0%
retiree health a lot with this committee
with

01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
finance committees in both the house and
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
senate is that the market in new
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire has evolved
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
and when we were first confronted with
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
shortfalls in
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
retiree health and looking at various
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
cost containment strategies
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't have medicare advantage in our
 
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.430 align:start position:0%
we didn't have medicare advantage in our
toolbox

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
toolbox
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
and by the time we got to 2018
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
the market was maturing here in new
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that's why we could
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
move our members to a medicare advantage
 
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
move our members to a medicare advantage
product

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
in 2019 then when we went out to bid we
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
knew that there were
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
other carriers in the market apart from
 
01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:09.110 align:start position:0%
other carriers in the market apart from
anthem

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
anthem
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
and and when we went out to bid we
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
expected there to be
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of competition and there was and
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
we achieved
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
really really amazing rates and
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and the savings that you see
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh for governors recommended a 17.6
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
million dollar reduction off of fiscal
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then in 23 uh an additional 11.8
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's attributed to that procurement
 
01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.110 align:start position:0%
that's attributed to that procurement
and

01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
i i really can't emphasize enough the
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
very hard
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
and um and wonderful work of the
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
division of risk and benefits again it's
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
director joyce pittman
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's her staff with deputy director
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
margaret blacker
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
this is a lot of work for them not just
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the procurement arena by the way but
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
changing carriers especially with
 
01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.550 align:start position:0%
changing carriers especially with
retirees

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
is is a big deal there's a lot of
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
implementation that goes
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
along with it there's a lot of support
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
provide to our retirees so that they are
 
01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
provide to our retirees so that they are
comfortable

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
with the changes that they're
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
experiencing and
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
one thing i think we've been doing quite
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
well in risk and benefits with respect
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
to our retirees
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
is to educate them probably going back
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
to 2015 at this point
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
that um we all need to expect change and
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
procurement is going to be one of those
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
arenas where
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
um we have um we have the ability
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
to save money and that's by going out to
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
bid for
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
our medical carrier for our um
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
prescription drug
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
benefits carrier and and they should
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
expect change if that's one way that we
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
can help contain
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
costs so again wonderful results
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful work by our division of risk
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:02.990 align:start position:0%
i i want to add to that that um
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:06.229 align:start position:0%
i i want to add to that that um
[Music]

01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
we as a department we we play small ball
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
we hit a lot of singles
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
every day that's what we do our job wake
 
01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.229 align:start position:0%
every day that's what we do our job wake
up

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
try and put the ball in play and hit a
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
single this is a home run
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
and we're not in the home run business
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
but we had a hell of a good grand slam
 
01:12:22.239 --> 01:12:23.030 align:start position:0%
but we had a hell of a good grand slam
here

01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm taking credit for it and i'm not
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
letting it go
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
and i want everyone to not throw this
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
slide away you can dump everything else
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the trash but for god's sakes please
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
keep this one
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
because it's this result is ridiculous
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's insane and it's and it's not going
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
to happen again
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
but that's a home run and
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to say especially since i
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
know it wasn't because retirees died
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
from covet
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes i think we actually we think we
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
weren't hit that hard
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
i think we think our people did pretty
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
well yeah i gathered that when
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
cassie sent me some stats on something
 
01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:58.790 align:start position:0%
cassie sent me some stats on something
else

01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
um representative emerick please thank
 
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.870 align:start position:0%

i would like to take a moment of
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
personal privilege
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
as a participant of the program as a
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
state rep we can
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
we can go on the as a paid participant
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
we can go on on the retiree program
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
if you're or the regular program i'm
 
01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.229 align:start position:0%
if you're or the regular program i'm
assuming

01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
my monthly cost went from over 600
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
to about 450 so it's a home run for us
 
01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:25.990 align:start position:0%
to about 450 so it's a home run for us
too

01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
well that's great i'm glad to hear that
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you very much
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
very happy to hear so cassie we're sorry
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
you didn't get any credit that the
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner took all of it but good job
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you now i'm in trouble okay
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner i
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
i've got my index here of hp2 which
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
lba bless her heart somehow managed to
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
get this out
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
almost as soon as we got hb2 i do not
 
01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:55.270 align:start position:0%
almost as soon as we got hb2 i do not
know

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
how they do all the great work they do
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
we have not talked about
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of these instances so i'm going
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
to start with
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
section 5 and see what page that's on
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
section five starts on page two so can
 
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:17.910 align:start position:0%
section five starts on page two so can
you

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
run us through these because we need to
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
sure so section five is
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
is about bureau planning and management
 
01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.229 align:start position:0%
is about bureau planning and management
um

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things we're doing as an
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
agency in the plant and property side is
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
the the the old construct is that
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
they're all they're a bunch of
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
silos court facilities as a sire general
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
services as a silo
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
and and uh facilities and asset
 
01:14:41.679 --> 01:14:42.149 align:start position:0%
and and uh facilities and asset
management

01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
as a silo in different buildings so you
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
know for example if you think of the
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
state hospital campus there are four
 
01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:48.229 align:start position:0%
state hospital campus there are four
different

01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh building management teams for that
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
campus right
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
hhs patient occupied buildings are one
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
group they
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
they do they the old hhs buildings are
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
we administer under bfam
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
there are other buildings administered
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
under general services and unemployment
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
security does its own building
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous for a guy mowing the
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
lawn to stop this is a
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
this is a dumb example but it makes the
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
point um
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
like you don't stop and go oh wait i'm
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
in enemy territory now i need to not
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
i i'm okay mowing spalding but i'm not
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
going anywhere near dollop and i'm gonna
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
go up to this line so we're so we're
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
doing that uh planning and management is
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
a bureau of one person
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
and just as a general principle i think
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
the duties of
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
the duties of our department should be
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh enumerated in state law either at the
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
division level or the
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
or the um department level and that's
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
all that's all that is
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
and it just allows for the sort of ease
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
of operation of the agency
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
um section six we kind of talked about
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
that a little bit but this
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
is the payment and procurement card fund
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
and that's just uh uh p-card rebates
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
will be part of uh
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
revenues and uh p-cards will be on
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
budget instead of off-budget and
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
and supporting just part of purchasing
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to section eight which
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
starts at the bottom of page four if
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
you're tracking that it
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
remotely uh the consolidation of hr
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
function this is something that has been
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
in the budget for geez it might even be
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
a decade at this point
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
do we need this well what it does is
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's part of a mandate for us to
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
to to do things and and it allows us the
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to do certain things
 
01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:31.110 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to do certain things
and

01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
when this was first put in the budget
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
there was a notion that
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
that things are either a centralized or
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
b decentralized
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
no no such thing as c um frankly in
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
particularly the personnel system and
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
the hr functions of the state
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
we've decided that c is the right answer
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
not a or b
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
for example the department of safety has
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
a more than a thousand employees and an
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
hr function
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
and a staff and and does it very well
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
how they operate and how their employees
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
are served by the hr function
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
is very different from say the
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh fewer than 90 employees they have a
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
one person who does hr and payroll and
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
some other stuff
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
and you can't be a
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
you can't be an army of one and be
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
and know everything about fmla fully
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
flsa and the federal law and be
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh adept at every piece of the operation
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
so one of the things we're looking at is
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
amalgamating functions and
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
and we call it an hrsu human resources
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
support or service unit i forget which
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
is the yes but the idea of saying
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to merge
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
these people and they're going to work
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of mou's right now
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
where for example
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
labor's hr person sits in the division
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
of personnel
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
and is is trained on some things well
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
you you'll have three people that work
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
for three agencies
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
but each of them can become more adept
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
at some things
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're a unit of one at an
 
01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.390 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're a unit of one at an
agency

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
and you do a significant fmoa claim one
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
one time and then don't face it again
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know your skill level is just
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
naturally not going to be as
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
as good so that language is there to
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
allow us
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to just function that way
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
and without
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
without need all right um
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
section nine is
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
also yours and that starts on page
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
six oh section nine is the language of
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is language that's in every year
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
that allows the state employee health
 
01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:44.790 align:start position:0%
that allows the state employee health
plan

01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
to be extended to uh unrepresented
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
confidential etc employees
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's a it's uh pro forma not pro forma
 
01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:53.510 align:start position:0%
it's a it's uh pro forma not pro forma
it's

01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's necessary language for the
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
operation of the plan and we've done it
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative elishman you
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
have a question uh certainly the
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
language is familiar to us that serve on
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal but i had a question
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
it says uh may does that say shell now
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
or what what page and what line are you
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
looking at i'm sorry page six still nine
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh line uh 18 and 19 where the fiscal
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee of the general court may
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
approve changes
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
don't you say shell because we always
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
approve those we have in the past on
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal interest
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have approved it i believe that is
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
existing language
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
not so i think it is existing language
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i think the difference between mae
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
and chell
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
here and i i understand what
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative leishman is getting it
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
um i think that it's meant to ensure
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh and and cassie's going to correct me
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
on this because she's a lawyer
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
um it's meant to ensure that the fiscal
 
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.790 align:start position:0%
um it's meant to ensure that the fiscal
committee

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
can do what it wants fiscal committee
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to approve changes they can
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
reject them
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
is that right cassie is that the
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
difference between may and
 
01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:09.050 align:start position:0%
difference between may and
shall

01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
we may approve or we shall approve it
 
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
we may approve or we shall approve it
doesn't

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
still i think it should say so because
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
any of the changes
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
should require the uh approval of the
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
um it certainly would be art would be
 
01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:36.470 align:start position:0%
um it certainly would be art would be
our

01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
expect expectation anyway so check with
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
them and i think i'm sure we'll be okay
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks okay so section 10 is
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
really kind of a doit
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
thing but it applies to all agencies
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
because it says
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
that you may provide documents by
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
electronic mailing in lieu of man
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're not opposed to that are you no i
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
i think we actually recommend it yeah
 
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.629 align:start position:0%
i think we actually recommend it yeah
absolutely

01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
um section 12 talks about a repeal will
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
oh that's part of the um plant and
 
01:21:12.239 --> 01:21:13.110 align:start position:0%
oh that's part of the um plant and
property

01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
change in 2005 a big chunk of buildings
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
on the hospital campus were transferred
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
hhs used to have its own property
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
function okay
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
and they were and so if we're if we're
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
merging bureaus
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
not merging bureaus merging functions um
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're the only agency that has a
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
separate mou so this way
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's the same everyone's the same
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay so i think your last
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
section in hb2 unless i'm wrong is
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
section 11
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
which is found at the bottom of page six
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
section 11. and this was the suspension
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
and she's not that we put in for you
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
because we did not
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
staff you yes because the goal is
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
if we can't staff you we don't want you
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
getting a ding
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
in a performance on it because the
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislature failed to give you what you
 
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.070 align:start position:0%
legislature failed to give you what you
need

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
these are the ones that had been worked
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
out before and you know obviously as a
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
as an entity we do
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know we do everything we can and we
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
do parts of everything we can but
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's some
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
some pieces of this that are that are
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
just necessary for us to
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
not do or we would require significant
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
staff increases
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
so i assume we want to keep that because
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we put it in there and you're
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
already short staffed in other areas so
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see us
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
going in now and adding something that
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't left before
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
and they're the same things as as past
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
years it's it's not a different set of
 
01:22:36.639 --> 01:22:37.110 align:start position:0%
years it's it's not a different set of
uh

01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
items do you have any other sections in
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
hb2 other than the ones i
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
have found um section 14 and 15. uh
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
they're starting
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
and 15. okay we will pay about
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
14 starts at the bottom of page seven
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
and they're the same thing it's related
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
to the medical subsidy
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
there has been there's actually a house
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill that that um
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
is working on this as well but um this
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
is this is our
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
the retiree health plan is uh funded by
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
something called the medical subsidy
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
which was passed as part of the 2005
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
budget this is unrelated
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
completely unrelated to the thing called
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
um that local gov some local employees
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
have in the retirement system ours is
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
ours is different it's not a subsidy to
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's a subsidy to the state plan it was
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
put in the budget in o5 and
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
zl5 might have been o3 um
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
i just remember jack barnes was fine it
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
was senate finance chair
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
laid out huge difficulty agreeing on the
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
budget that year
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh um
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
senate rejected the house version and
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
started over which
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen this year um the
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
could no i'm sure no it'll be fine
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
everything will be great don't just take
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
but they'll take what you do and say
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's good
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i doubt it um i doubt it it's my
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
hunch um uh anyway so the medical
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
subsidy is supposed to
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh pay for employee costs there was
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
later a premium was established and the
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
premium is in addition to and
 
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.910 align:start position:0%
premium is in addition to and
notwithstanding

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
other payments so we thought
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
at admin services that the language in
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
addition to and notwithstanding was
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
clear because it
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
kind of seems clear in addition to and
 
01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.470 align:start position:0%
kind of seems clear in addition to and
notwithstanding

01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
um the retirement system is not clear
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
and they think that um and they don't
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
care which clarification this has been
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
their position
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
we don't care if it it's what you think
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
should happen or not what you think
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
should happen
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
we think it should be clarified um
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know we had the attorney general's
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
office do an analysis on this and um
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
this changes the law in all the places
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
that it occurs so there's not any future
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
and it leaves the addition to and
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding language in so the
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
people understand that
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
the premium isn't in it is in addition
 
01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.830 align:start position:0%
the premium isn't in it is in addition
to

01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
and notwithstanding other payments and
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
the medical subsidy
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we fund we send money to hh or to
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and they send it
 
01:25:08.639 --> 01:25:09.669 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and they send it
back

01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
um is to fund the retiree health plan
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what it's for
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
and so 14 does group two 15 does the
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
same thing for group one is that correct
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
um i believe that's right it's it's it's
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
the the law i mean frankly this
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
this these sections of the law are a
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
if you were going to do a rewrite of
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
statute i'm not
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
yes and nobody is and that's why they're
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
like this because they
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
they they date to a period when the
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
retirement system did things that they
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
don't do now
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
and when uh and when we didn't self-fund
 
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
and when uh and when we didn't self-fund
our

01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
our policy but but the languages
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh is about the medical subsidy and it's
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
important if it
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't go through there are about
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
600 and some retirees
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
right now that we are having to bill for
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
their premium because the retirement
 
01:25:59.199 --> 01:26:00.390 align:start position:0%
their premium because the retirement
system

01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
is unsure whether they can bill
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
um unsure whether they can collect so
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
they used to and now they're not and
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
this clarifies that and this clarifies
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
that 100
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
and it makes sure that the the medical
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
subsidy goes to support the plan
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't we would need additional
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay i think the commissioner has given
 
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.149 align:start position:0%
okay i think the commissioner has given
us

01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%

01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%

plant

01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
plant
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
property is budgeted in this in the
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
agency 16 is judicial appointment
 
01:31:33.199 --> 01:31:33.910 align:start position:0%
agency 16 is judicial appointment
service

01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm sorry slide
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
17 on our presentation i'm sorry
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay so on slides not in
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 guys yeah i'm sorry
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is we're into the errata on page 17
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the slides which we hadn't gotten to
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
anyway so okay we're proceeding on
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner so we budgeted six hundred
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars wrong
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
as a short version um the money is
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted correct in agency budgets
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
and it is budgeted as general funds in
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
ours when it should be budgeted
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
as agency income
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
it said at least it's an error in the
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping maybe we can use the 600 000
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
because you already think we have it
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
i believe that some of our positions but
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is the venus is online and she's
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
our our lba
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
associate who works on these
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
nancy is this clear to you so we can get
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
amendments to make this happen yes i i
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
believe some adam chair thank you all
 
01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:40.709 align:start position:0%
believe some adam chair thank you all
right

01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
charlie and if it isn't we'll work with
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
her on we will make that happen and she
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
if she has a question she'll reach out
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
good thank you represent hatch he's
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
still not leaving but you had something
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair just going
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
back to the reimbursement for the
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
if you could commissioner i mean it's a
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
as uh to burj mentioned it's a matter of
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
logistics more so than the matter of
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
population that can impact that but what
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if you could send me
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
um the history for at least the last
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
biennium by
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
county of the reimbursements i i just
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
want to look at it i mean it's uh
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
to see the impact the overall
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
expenditure is a million but i'm
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
um just to get a better sense of that
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's awesome oh good yeah we can do
 
01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:23.910 align:start position:0%
that's awesome oh good yeah we can do
that

01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
sure if you get that to janet she'll get
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
it out to all the division members
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
because obviously there are a couple of
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
people with questions about this but
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
everybody would probably like to see
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
that good i'll try and get that to janet
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
um this week
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's great thank you commissioner
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair no no thank you
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay the only other thing madam share
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
there's an item that's not ours but i
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
want to call to
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
your attention because it isn't ours in
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
back to hp2 section 19 on page nine
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
is related to the sale of the lakes
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
region facility
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes and i know somebody might ask about
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
or later wish they had um
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
this is not something this is not
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
something we um
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
we work with the lakes region
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
development commission
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
because obviously who else would they
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
work with um
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
naturally right um and and uh mike
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
connor who's our
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
who's retired from us but working
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
part-time has been helping them
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
um so that's in the law and the sale is
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
a process that we would do
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
um and i would just point out to you
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
that that this is something that they're
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're looking at selling but this
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
would um
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're agnostic about this it does it
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
does change the way it's sold and i
 
01:34:49.199 --> 01:34:49.990 align:start position:0%
does change the way it's sold and i
think

01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing it does is take out
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
historical resources and
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
um the legislature's long-range planning
 
01:34:55.679 --> 01:34:57.590 align:start position:0%
um the legislature's long-range planning
commission

01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
um and just so i think that it becomes
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
an executive branch function
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
um without the legislative involvement
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we're gonna
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
proceed with that i just just wanted to
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
no i i don't think so i think he's still
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the commission too
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
we miss him his wife and
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
well both of them but his wife really
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
likes to be warm in the winter
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
and warm means a lot of time in florida
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
or you know the bahamas or
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
someplace yeah so we we understand that
 
01:35:44.719 --> 01:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
someplace yeah so we we understand that
i

01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely understand that yeah and are
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
jealous so
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
the finance committee is not conducive
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
to no and he
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
he told me he promised her that he would
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
not run again after he got through
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
that session i mean you know and i
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
understand that life is short you need
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
the good things for yourselves i hear
 
01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.189 align:start position:0%
the good things for yourselves i hear
that

01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
now before commissioner arlen house and
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
his staff leave
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%

01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
covered i really appreciate you for
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%

01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
helping us go through your budget so
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
effectively we're happy to talk anytime
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
i see no questions oh representative
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
leishman i spoke too soon i'm gonna take
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
personal privilege like uh
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
mr tracy did here earlier but i just
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
want to say
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um i was here when we had past
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners i go way back to
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner hill i believe his name was
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i shouldn't say this but he could
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
never get a straight answer out of
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner oh i remember him
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't say that but it's true but i
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
think charlie you're such a credit
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
to this agency how you've turned it
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
around and
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
um you know people often say they can't
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
sleep at night because of a certain
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
thing i think i could probably say sleep
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
better at night knowing
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
you're the commissioner of the dis so
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you what a remarkably nice thing
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
to say i
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
i um but i don't really do anything
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
i um you're too modest i have an
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
ingredient no i seriously i have an
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
incredible staff and
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%

option of coming to see you in person to
 
01:43:58.159 --> 01:43:59.109 align:start position:0%
option of coming to see you in person to

testify
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the wonderful things about
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
this process is the people that we work
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
with and it's
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
been a little bit of a struggle not to
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
be able to see folks in the past most of
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
people are testifying
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
if you feel comfortable are taking off
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
their masks we have as you see
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
over here in the corner extra filtration
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
equipment it
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
is cleaning the air five times every
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
hour which is wonderful
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
and there's one in the back doing the
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
same most of us are wearing our masks
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
but you're going to be talking longer
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot harder to get oxygen
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
so welcome thank you very much i'm
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
pleased to present the bank department's
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
budget proposal for
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
2022 and 2023 biennium
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
um the department goes through a very uh
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
inclusive process to draft up its budget
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
every two years
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
we have a very strong management team
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
directors of each division
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
come together as do many other folks
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
that are the subject matter experts that
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
we deal with
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
and as a team we deliver this budget to
 
01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
and as a team we deliver this budget to
you

01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
the bank department is structured in two
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
separate divisions there's the banking
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
and trust
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
supervision division which is accounting
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
unit 2046
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
and then there's the consumer credit
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
division which is accounting unit 2043
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
the banking trust supervision division
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
is probably the one that people think of
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
the most because
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
that group is responsible has
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over examination and
 
01:45:25.199 --> 01:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over examination and
consumer

01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
safety for 16 banks
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
nine credit unions and 34 non-depository
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
trust companies the other half of our
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
business however is the consumer credit
 
01:45:38.159 --> 01:45:38.950 align:start position:0%
business however is the consumer credit
division

01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
a separate accounting unit accounting
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
unit 20043
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
and they oversee literally thousands of
 
01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:47.669 align:start position:0%
and they oversee literally thousands of
licensees

01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
that provide products and services to
 
01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
consumers in the state of new hampshire
 
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
so think mortgage bankers
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
auto lenders small loan companies money
 
01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.189 align:start position:0%
auto lenders small loan companies money
service

01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
businesses money transmitters we do all
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
of that with
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
54 positions not all of them filled
 
01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.550 align:start position:0%
54 positions not all of them filled
however

01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
we have five that are funded but vacant
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
we have six positions that are currently
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
funded but don't have anybody in them
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
right now and we may have plans
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
we do have plans to possibly use some of
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
within this upcoming biennium that we're
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
your handout says they're unfunded yes
 
01:46:25.199 --> 01:46:25.510 align:start position:0%
your handout says they're unfunded yes
five

01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
unfun uh six unfunded yes five funded
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
the five funded positions we may be
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
seeking to use some of those
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the coming biennium
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
um we are not seeking any new positions
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
i haven't for the past two years we
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
won't uh
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the 2223 biennium either
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
the next bullet you see does mention
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we may consolidate
 
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
or reclassify some of the positions that
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
we currently have funding for that are
 
01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.550 align:start position:0%
we currently have funding for that are
open

01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
we may actually do some reclassifying
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
reorganization of positions that are
 
01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.270 align:start position:0%
reorganization of positions that are
funded

01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
primarily due to the fact that
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
the non-depository trust company charter
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire is really
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
taking off we're receiving numerous
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
applications every year for new trust
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
company charters it's unusual
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
and we may need to redirect some of our
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
staff to focus on
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
some of those the proposals that we're
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
receiving these days
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
are quite unique and propose
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
extremely large financial institutions
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
the bank department does not use any
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
general funds we don't use any federal
 
01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.430 align:start position:0%
general funds we don't use any federal
funds

01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
100 percent of our revenue is
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
other sources agency income in other
 
01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:44.629 align:start position:0%
other sources agency income in other
words

01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're entirely funded by the fees and
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
fines that will collect during the year
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
and if there is a shortfall
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
we have the ability within state statute
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
to issue an assessment against all of
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
the entities that we have jurisdiction
 
01:47:57.119 --> 01:47:58.149 align:start position:0%
the entities that we have jurisdiction
over

01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
and to collect that shortfall from from
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
them so we always balance out at the end
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
the budget proposal that we submitted
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
was slightly larger
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
than that which was suggested by the
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
governor we met
 
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
with then budget director max zellum
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
and discussed why there was a difference
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
between what we thought we needed and
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
what they needed
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
and concurred on the figures that the
 
01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.510 align:start position:0%
and concurred on the figures that the
governor

01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
has proposed for the bank department so
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
we're very
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea that we can
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
run the department in 2022 and 2023 with
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
the figure of
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
six million six hundred forty six
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
thousand one hundred and fifty three
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
dollars that the governor has proposed
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
for operating both of those
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
accounting units 2046 and 2043.
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal is about uh 222
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
000 less for 22
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
than we are authorized to spend this
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
year in 2021
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
the 2023 proposal is about 95
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
000 hardly a material difference in the
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
world of the state government
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
from what we are currently spending
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
authorized to spend in 2021
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
with that said um that's the sort of the
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of our budget it's pretty
 
01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:19.350 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of our budget it's pretty
simple

01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
um we're a small organization um we're
 
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:22.950 align:start position:0%
um we're a small organization um we're
self-funded

01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh and we have tried over the past
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
several years to become as lean
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
as we possibly can be there were
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
questions that were proposed
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
to agencies from chairwoman ober
 
01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.669 align:start position:0%
to agencies from chairwoman ober
regarding

01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
addition of staff as i've mentioned for
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
answers to questions
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
one and two we do not plan any new
 
01:49:43.199 --> 01:49:44.070 align:start position:0%
one and two we do not plan any new
full-time

01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
staff we do not plan to bring on any new
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
part-time staff we have nor have we
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate any positions within our
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
budget to meet the governor's
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation as i mentioned we have
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
five funded but not
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
filled positions and we believe that
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
to address the challenges the department
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
is facing we will be able to use those
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
currently funded positions
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
through reclassification and and
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
reorganization to meet all
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
challenges ahead of the department you
 
01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:17.510 align:start position:0%
challenges ahead of the department you
see

01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
um some detail there uh
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
in answer to question number four as a
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of specifics about how we
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
might do that one of the positions we
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
are talking about needing to fill
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
currently funded
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
and would be funded in the 2223 proposal
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
is a paralegal position in our legal
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
division and we may need to activate
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
that position to keep up with the legal
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
work that's coming our way as a result
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the increase in non-depository trust
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
question number six uh
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
we'll probably want some discussion uh
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
the question asked whether or not there
 
01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:00.790 align:start position:0%
the question asked whether or not there
was

01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
anything within state law that we're
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
required to do
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
um that we may not want to be doing
 
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.589 align:start position:0%
um that we may not want to be doing
anymore

01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
and it also relates to the answer at
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
question number eight which is on the
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
last page
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire banking department has
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
been required
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
since the late 80s early 90s to
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
manage the public deposit investment
 
01:51:24.159 --> 01:51:25.270 align:start position:0%
manage the public deposit investment
pool

01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
also known as the dip the padip
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
is a service provided to
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
municipals municipal municipalities
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
other governmental units
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
for holding their cash
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
the idea is that we would aggregate it
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
we will aggregate it we do aggregate it
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
in a pool
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
we do contract with
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
an administrator pfm is the name of the
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
company that we've been using
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
and they invest the cash in an effort to
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
try to generate
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
a return on those
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
available liquid funds for cities and
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
towns counties school districts etc all
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
across the state of new hampshire
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
the public deposit investment pool
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
manages a pool
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
until recently where it dipped down a
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
little bit but generally it's about a
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
quarter of a billion dollars
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
on any given day 250 million dollars
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
that is collected from municipalities
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
school districts etc governmental units
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
across the state of new hampshire
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
and sent out for investment the public
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool has attempted to
 
01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:39.430 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool has attempted to
try

01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
try
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
to find ways to invest deposit the funds
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
i should say rather than invest deposit
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
the funds
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
with community banks and credit unions
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
to one support those industries and two
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
to put the money
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
that is collected generally through
 
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:56.550 align:start position:0%
that is collected generally through
taxation

01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire back to
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
work in the state of new hampshire
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
they've not been able to do that they
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
can attract a better rate for those
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
funds by taking them
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
nation nationwide or in fact
 
01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.229 align:start position:0%
nation nationwide or in fact
internationally

01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
internationally
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
and putting them with other entities so
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
that quarter billion dollars on any
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
given day
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
is leaving the state of new hampshire
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
and going to places where it can get a
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
better rate of return
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
because ultimately that is the fiduciary
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the public deposit
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
investment pool is to maximize the
 
01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:26.550 align:start position:0%
investment pool is to maximize the
return

01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers from the cities and
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
towns and school districts etc
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
who have put the money with them most
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
states do run public deposit investment
 
01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:37.350 align:start position:0%
states do run public deposit investment
pools

01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
pools
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the only state in the
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
entire country
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
that puts its public deposit investment
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
pool in its banking department
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
that creates a conflict of interest for
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
the managers of the banking department
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
because on most days of the year
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
we're wearing a hat that tells us that
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
we have a responsibility to make sure
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
that the banks
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the credit unions and the other
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
entities that we regulate are safe
 
01:54:02.239 --> 01:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
entities that we regulate are safe
strong

01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
strong
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
operating very effectively and on the
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
days that i become
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for the public deposit
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
investment pool i take off that hat
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
and i try to see how fiercely can i
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
compete with those banks that i regulate
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
how much money can i take out of their
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
liquid funds that are being lent back
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
into the communities
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
to send someplace else to gain a better
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
return for the cities and towns and
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
school districts of the state of new
 
01:54:25.119 --> 01:54:25.830 align:start position:0%
school districts of the state of new
hampshire

01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
i've struggled with that conflict
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
between my responsibility as bank
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner to
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
consumers and the chattered entities
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
that we represent
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
and my responsibility to the public
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
and the municipalities and counties and
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
that use that we've talked about this
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years now at the public
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool it's been a
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
constant issue on our quarterly meeting
 
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.470 align:start position:0%
constant issue on our quarterly meeting
agendas

01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
agendas
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
i have met with a number of entities to
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
see if we couldn't stimulate
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
interest in pursuing a form
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
that is used in many of the most of the
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
other states every other state other
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
which would be to have a separate entity
 
01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:08.229 align:start position:0%
which would be to have a separate entity
take

01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the public deposit
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
investment pool from the banking
 
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.189 align:start position:0%
investment pool from the banking
department

01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh and i've not been able to generate
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's been plenty of conversation
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
but i've not been able to generate
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
interest in anybody to take that over
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
most recently what i recommended to the
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
public deposit investment pool is that
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
the banking department be allowed at
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
least to recover
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
expenses that it incurs on behalf of the
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
public deposit investment pool
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned at the outset when i
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
discussed the source of funds and the
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
fact that the bank department is
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
self-funding and that would balance our
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
budget every year
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're funded by the banks and the trust
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
companies and the credit unions
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
and we send all of them a bill at the
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
end of the year
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
that says this is the shortfall here is
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
your pro rata share
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
please send us a check so what we have
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
is a situation where
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm doing my best to hold down the
 
01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:01.589 align:start position:0%
i'm doing my best to hold down the
assessment

01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
that we're charging to the entities that
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
we have jurisdiction over so that we're
 
01:56:06.639 --> 01:56:06.950 align:start position:0%
we have jurisdiction over so that we're
not

01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
impacting them dramatically fiscally
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
through the operation of the department
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
and on the other hand
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
that assessment includes the time spent
 
01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:17.350 align:start position:0%
that assessment includes the time spent
by

01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
banking department lawyers and other
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
staff to work on the public deposit
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
investment pool which then competes with
 
01:56:23.199 --> 01:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
investment pool which then competes with
them

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
so we're asking those entities to pay
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
the freight to the entities that i'm
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
operating the public deposit investment
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
pool that's competing with them to take
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
deposits out of those entities
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
and send them someplace else around the
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
world to be invested rather than being
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
invested here in new hampshire it's been
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
operating this way for a long time
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
i understand that and i think we've been
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
very careful
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
and patient and listening and a lot of
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
conversation going on
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
before we propose anything we have a
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
concept that we
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
are prepared to pursue my sense is that
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is public policy and it probably is a
 
01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
little bit much to put into house bill
 
01:57:01.119 --> 01:57:01.990 align:start position:0%
little bit much to put into house bill
2.

01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
2.
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that would be to suggest a change in
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
in rsa 383 that would remove the public
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool from the banking
 
01:57:11.679 --> 01:57:12.550 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool from the banking
department

01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
and have a separate commission um
 
01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:16.390 align:start position:0%
and have a separate commission um
created

01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
for it to operate the public deposit
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
investment pool
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
most sorts of commissions exist today it
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
would not be unique to the public
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool it's a common
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
operation in state government in new
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire at this point in time
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
because we're talking the budget and
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal hook to it
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
and again i realize that when we
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
submitted the original budget pass
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
package back many many months ago um had
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
this thought
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
come up it would have been i believe on
 
01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:46.950 align:start position:0%
come up it would have been i believe on
form

01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
e of the budget submission in the
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
um scheme
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
but it only came up recently within the
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
past couple or two three weeks
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
this idea of at least charging
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
the pool for the expenses that
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
we incur on its behalf so you will see
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
on the last page
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the handout that we've provided you
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
under number eight
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
um suggested language that we would ask
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
you to consider adding to house bill 2
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
and it's roman 5 at the bottom of that
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
page the italicized bolded language
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
is is the addition the previous language
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
from romans 1 through 4
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
already exists roman 5 would allow the
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
banking department
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
um to submit a request for reimbursement
 
01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:34.870 align:start position:0%
um to submit a request for reimbursement
to

01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
the manager of the public deposit
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
investment pool
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement of exact costs we
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
would use the per diem rate that we
 
01:58:42.639 --> 01:58:44.550 align:start position:0%
would use the per diem rate that we
charge

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
other entities that we perform functions
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
for that's
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
not a cheap rate it's about a thousand
 
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
seventy four dollars i believe right now
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
per staff person per day
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
that we work on them so you'll see in
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
this language that
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
that the let me just find it for you so
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
i can
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh well at the start of roman four the
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
actual cost
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
however you see at the fourth line from
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
the requirement that no entity shall be
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
charged or pay less than one full day
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
shall not apply
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
is in this language which means that we
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
will track our time by the hour and only
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
bill by the hour on this not by the day
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
which we believe would be would be fair
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the public deposit investment pool
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to make money on them
 
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're only looking to recover
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's my presentation chairman
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
other questions of the committee
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um with respect to
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
this public deposit investment pool this
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
is going to show my naivete
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
but why would this not fall into the
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
state treasurer i mean i thought she
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
was responsible for investing the money
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer does sit on the
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
board of the public deposit investment
 
02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:14.790 align:start position:0%
board of the public deposit investment
pool

02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
pool
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
advisory committee um we began this
 
02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:18.870 align:start position:0%
advisory committee um we began this
conversation

02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
back during the tenure of treasurer bill
 
02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:22.709 align:start position:0%
back during the tenure of treasurer bill
dwyer

02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
dwyer
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
and we have cons continued it with
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
current treasurer monica mezapelli
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
and in many many states
 
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
the public deposit investment pool does
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
fall within the jurisdiction of the
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
state treasurer
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is for most people the logical
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
place to put it
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to make more work for
 
02:00:44.239 --> 02:00:45.030 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to make more work for
anybody

02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
um or to push this off onto anybody that
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't want it and so we're having
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
a conversation treasurer mitzi pelle has
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
been involved in it just as treasurer of
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
dwyer was
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
place to put this i think people very
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
easily see the conflict of interest that
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
is created by
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
hosting the public deposit investment
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
pool within the banking department
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
um we're just looking to try to have
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
everybody on board for where this goes i
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to try to create any
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
controversy or difficulty for anybody in
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
the process of moving this on we'll
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
continue doing it
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're simply asking that we'd be able to
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
collect our expenses at this point in
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
time but i do
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
i think that's very um intuitive of you
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative walls that that's
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
where most states put it is is either
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
within or
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
or as a responsibility of the state
 
02:01:39.599 --> 02:01:41.030 align:start position:0%
or as a responsibility of the state
treasurer

02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
walls i do follow a please so the
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
implication of your answer is is that
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
many states put it in treasury
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
but apparently our treasurer doesn't
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
want it so there's a proposal to create
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
this independent commission rather than
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
put it with the treasurer because the
 
02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
treasurer doesn't want this
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
am i hearing this correctly well i
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't i wouldn't speak for treasurer
 
02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
wouldn't i wouldn't speak for treasurer
mezzapelli

02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
mezzapelli
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
or treasurer dwyer she'll be next you
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
could ask her then
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
before but i think that um
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
many other states don't some states
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't put it with their treasure
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
some some have created a separate
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
or this type of a commission where um
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
the treasurer and a representative of
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
the bank department will sit on the
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
board so that there is still
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
some involvement of those entities
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not under their responsibility
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
so but i i don't want to speak for
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
treasurer matsapeli
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
i think everybody's extremely busy these
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
days and nobody's looking forward to
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
more work is
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
probably the answer representative
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
emerick you have a question
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my understanding
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
that when you get to the end of the year
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to even up
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
and you send out the bills they don't
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
get billed
 
02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
they don't pay anything at all it's not
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
even at not even from the beginning of
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
the year so they never they don't
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
they're not included in the assessment
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year uh we perform
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
functions for and have for many years
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
perform functions for the public deposit
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
investment pool
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
around the calendar year long
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
but never collect a penny for for that
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
work which means that all of the
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
entities that we do
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
charge for ultimately end up um
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the operation of the public
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
deposit investment
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
what it would seem as a follow-up
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up it would seem as a minimum
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
receiving part of the allocation of your
 
02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:32.229 align:start position:0%
receiving part of the allocation of your
uncovered

02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
uncovered
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question i
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
understand i think that there's a
 
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that the funds that we're
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
talking about here are taxpayer monies
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
and that we really would like to see
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount maximum return
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
possible returned
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns and school
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
districts that
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
that placed their money with the public
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
by example i will tell you that pfm the
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
companies that we contract with to do
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
the administration of the public deposit
 
02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:10.709 align:start position:0%
the administration of the public deposit
poll

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
poll
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
does a very good job in my opinion
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
of managing the funds and being
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
extremely responsible and responsive to
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
the concerns of
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
governmental units in the in the state
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
they have written in the contract that
 
02:04:26.079 --> 02:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
they have written in the contract that
they

02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
signed with us the ability for them to
 
02:04:29.599 --> 02:04:30.790 align:start position:0%
signed with us the ability for them to
waive

02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
waive
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
their management fees and right now
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
in the last quarter they have been
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
managed waiving a percentage
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
of their management fees that they're
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
they are legally
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to charge to the pool because
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
they want to make
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
because interest rates are so low and
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to generate
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
some return to nothing about saying
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
nothing about
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
an attractive return that they're
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
willing to cut their fees
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
to keep the return to the cities and
 
02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:00.870 align:start position:0%
to keep the return to the cities and
towns

02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat responsible but also
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
competitive they have an interest in
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
keeping the pool
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
at a at a reasonable size as i mentioned
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's normally about a quarter of a
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars it's drifted down a
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
lately um and so um
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're very responsibly saying we'd
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
rather take a little bit of a haircut on
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
our fees
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
than lose participation in the pool i am
 
02:05:21.599 --> 02:05:22.310 align:start position:0%
than lose participation in the pool i am
sensitive

02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
to the fact that if we're not coming
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
along saying and we'd like to be able to
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
collect our
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
exact expenses we're not looking for
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
anything more
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh to make any money off the pool just
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
to recover our expenses
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
pfm is doing what everything they can to
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
maintain competitive standing of the
 
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
pool we think we should
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
join them in that so
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
jerry if i can just kind of summarize
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
you're you've had ongoing discussions
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
you continue to have ongoing discussions
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
you've looked at what
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
other states do but i believe you are
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
correct that kind of a policy change
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
requires a bill to be fired so what you
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
are proposing
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
is a small one paragraph change
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
that allows your agency
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
to recoup its expenses only its expenses
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
not make any money and not charge
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
the people that would be in competition
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
so this kind of evens a playing field
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
for everybody do i have that correctly
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly stated madam chair all right
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on
 
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's budget which does
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
start on page 325.
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
as he said it is lower than what they
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
wanted they have five unfunded positions
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
they spend zero general fund dollars
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
you're all completely self-funded
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
so we normally wouldn't once the
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
governor is done with you
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
we normally if you're happy we're happy
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
but any questions on the budget
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
represent walls yes madam chair
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
i i'd actually like to return for one
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
moment i have uh two quick questions on
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
the fund that the
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner is just talking about one
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
is he's not talking about a fund
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative walls he's talking
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
about invoicing this group for the
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
expenses that they pay
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
there is no fund involved well i'm
 
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps i
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
my choice of words is not as precise as
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
but i still have a question and one is
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
um the first one is
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
are there policies to um how much risk
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
can be made in the investments and the
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
second question is
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
have you looked at the cost of the
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
overhead okay one question at a time
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
let's let me
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
ask answer that one okay she asked about
 
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:41.910 align:start position:0%
ask answer that one okay she asked about
risks

02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
risks
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes there are policies um that are
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
presented by pfm
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner and the public
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool
 
02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
for review and approval relative to the
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of risk and the types of
 
02:07:58.719 --> 02:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of risk and the types of
investments

02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
investments
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
that may be used by the public deposit
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
investment pool there is absolutely a
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
written policy
 
02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
that we observe thank you follow up
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh the second question is a different
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
topic and that is the proposal you've
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
got here in roman five
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
of charging the agencies have you looked
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
at the cost
 
02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
of the overhead of administering
 
02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.870 align:start position:0%
of the overhead of administering
administrating

02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
administrating
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
administering that versus um the amount
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
that you'll collect or the benefit of
 
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
the collection
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's just cost benefit that's all i'm
 
02:08:27.599 --> 02:08:29.189 align:start position:0%
it's just cost benefit that's all i'm
asking

02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
asking
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
right have we looked at essentially have
 
02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:32.709 align:start position:0%
right have we looked at essentially have
i

02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
guesstimated what the dollar amount will
 
02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
guesstimated what the dollar amount will
be

02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
that we will build the public deposit
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
investment pool
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
is that true have you looked at the cost
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
if you're going to start billing them
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost you money to bill
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
them you're going to have to have
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
somebody take time to do that
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
and the cost of having one person or
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
multiple people
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
put together those bills to each agency
 
02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
have you looked at
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
what that's going to cost you yes it
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
will be negligible
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
um we currently do track our staff time
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can create the bills that we
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
send out for examination so
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
the majority of our staff is already
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
billing their time
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's all part of and it's it's been
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
synchronized into
 
02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
the state's timekeeping system for um
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
paying paying our staff for creating
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
paychecks so it's a system that we have
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
in place already we won't have to create
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
a new one
 
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are a few people that don't
 
02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:32.950 align:start position:0%
there are a few people that don't
currently

02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
monitor their stat their
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
activity generally by the hour myself
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
and the deputy commissioner
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
included we are
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
two of the unclassified positions within
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
the department and so we are paid a
 
02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:51.109 align:start position:0%
the department and so we are paid a
salary

02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
salary
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that in the past year
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
due to some unique efforts that we've
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
been involved in
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
for me it was operating the gopher
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
office for five months and for
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
many of my staff it is now volunteering
 
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
at the covet call center
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
we're all tr we now all have the ability
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
to track our time by the hour so that we
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
can properly
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
allot it to the buckets that they will
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
be paid out of so
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question thank you the
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
effort will be minimal for us to
 
02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
be able to track our time and bill thank
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%

um what i would like to do today is um
um

02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
first my objectives will be to to
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
provide an overview of
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
our our budget and the structure of the
 
02:15:16.719 --> 02:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
our our budget and the structure of the
treasury

02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh highlight a few of the changes um
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
that are included in house bill 1 and
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
hospital 2
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully leave some time for some
 
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.350 align:start position:0%
and hopefully leave some time for some
questions

02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
and so i i was i was hoping to share my
 
02:15:33.430 --> 02:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
screen i'm not sure if i'm going to be
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
able to do that just so we can
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
look at the the spreadsheet that i
 
02:15:39.119 --> 02:15:40.550 align:start position:0%
look at the the spreadsheet that i
provided

02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
anything you provided to us has been
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
placed on
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
the lba website people can bring it up
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
who are listening
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to worry about sharing
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
your screen we have technology
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
the people in the room do not have
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
computers so they got
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
a hard copy this morning when they got
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
here but everybody else has an
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
electronic copy
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you so then again i will i
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
will just um
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
um i will sort of go uh over the
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
narrative that i have the
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
line and also look at the numbers at the
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
same time um so hopefully you can follow
 
02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:15.589 align:start position:0%
same time um so hopefully you can follow
me

02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
so so first i will start with the uh the
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
structure of the treasury
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
we have 23 positions uh 12 positions are
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the division of treasury operations
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
and 10 positions in the abandoned
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
property division
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
we have um three uh four vacant
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
positions right now
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
or hope that now we're able to to fill
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
positions that or hope is to
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
to try to uh fill those vacancies uh so
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
we can operate more effectively
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh and and i meant to mention the uh
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
there is one position that is part of
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship program
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
that came to us uh in the last biennium
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the um to the actual uh
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
structure of our budget
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh our corporations are are about two
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the entire budget
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh which includes our treasury
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
operations and the division of vandal
 
02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
operations and the division of vandal
property

02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
the rest of the rest of our budget is
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
really um
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
just items are pretty much out of our
 
02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:14.709 align:start position:0%
just items are pretty much out of our
control

02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
and so but um but obviously i will i
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
will go over that and
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
the um this the largest
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
portion of our budget it is uh debt
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
service so that represents approximately
 
02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
the um the debt service
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
funded uh with general fund and
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
projects related to usnh that is
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 45 of our budget and in
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
this biennium we are
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
um we are estimating that we will issue
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 million in bonds
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
um funded with general funds each year
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
in approximately 10 million for usnh
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
projects so one thing that is different
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh in house bill 2
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
is we created a or or a new accounting
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
unit was created to
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
start accounting for that service
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
related to
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
the proposed unified university system
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
we want to keep track of that that
 
02:18:18.559 --> 02:18:19.910 align:start position:0%
we want to keep track of that that
service

02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
the existing that service and the new
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
debt server separately
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
so if this new entity is created
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
or merged what we want to do is be able
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
to track that debt service and one
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
so that will be projects related to the
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
community college
 
02:18:39.509 --> 02:18:39.519 align:start position:0%
in the university system
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't i don't want to cover every
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
aspect of our debt service we do have
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
um school building aid and
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
existing that service for community
 
02:18:51.519 --> 02:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
existing that service for community
college

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
college
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
but what i would like to mention is um
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
what is what you're not gonna see here
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'll project the lapses um that
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
are were that are gonna be generated as
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
a result of a bond refund
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we did in december of last year
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh we were able to um
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
we had two two bond refunds and we were
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
able to generate uh
 
02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
present value savings of approximately
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
11.4 million
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
and so that is about 10 million over a
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
period of 10 years so the way this
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
refunding was structured
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
is that we're going to be able to
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
utilize the savings
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
during the first two years so in fiscal
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
year 21 we want to apply
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh where we're projected to apply 2.1
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
million in savings
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 22 um
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
we expect to apply 8.6 million in
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
service and and
 
02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
and that um 8.6 million in
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
savings sorry about that so that is not
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
included in this budget that was
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
information that
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
um came after our numbers put together
 
02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:00.870 align:start position:0%
um came after our numbers put together
but

02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
that like any other labs will lapse at
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
the the next uh large piece of our
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
budget is
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%

section
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
in hospital 2s starts in section 160.
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
it goes to 160 through 168
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
that is changing the um language related
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire excellence in higher
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
and what house bill 2 is proposing is to
 
02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
distribute this funding differently it
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
will send
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
60 of these funds to a newly created
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
student loan relief program that uh will
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
be administered by the
 
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
business finance authority and
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
the other pers the rest of the 40
 
02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:57.429 align:start position:0%
the other pers the rest of the 40
remainder

02:25:57.429 --> 02:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
remainder
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
remaining will fund the scholarship
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
programs the existing
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
um the only reason so in house bill 2
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
nothing changed
 
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
and demand this this this is abundant
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
and you will find that
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
um on the unique program
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
we budgeted 15.9 million fiscal year 22
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
and 15.9 million and fiscal is 23
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
and nothing is changing there
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
um everything will remain the same the
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
only thing that will
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
that will change is the way um that line
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
item the grants and scholarships
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
scholarships line will distribute the
 
02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.150 align:start position:0%
scholarships line will distribute the
funding

02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
so it would it will um
 
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
again we will pay um that percentage to
 
02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:54.630 align:start position:0%
again we will pay um that percentage to
the

02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
business finance authority for the
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
administration of the new program
 
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
and we will keep the other 40 percent to
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
pay for the administration of the two
 
02:27:01.439 --> 02:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
pay for the administration of the two
scholarship

02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
programs where do we find that dollar
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
those dollars in your budget what page
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
number and what account number
 
02:27:11.710 --> 02:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
the account number is
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
and you will find it on page 97 of the
 
02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:26.070 align:start position:0%
and you will find it on page 97 of the
budget

02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
and so the reason i mentioned that is
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
because you're not probably not going to
 
02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
hear from anybody else
 
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
about this this is this program's our
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
house and the treasury
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
and um again that's the reason i'm
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i would like to page 97 in the budget
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the page of of the
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
actual budget so
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
if your medicare
 
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
it is on page 175 of the governor's
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
budget your budget book
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we work off the governor's
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
budget monika we're in the governor's
 
02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:26.070 align:start position:0%
budget monika we're in the governor's
budget

02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's all we have we don't have
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
individual pages so we have to work
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
with these so uh nancy has said that's
 
02:28:33.630 --> 02:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
on page
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
175 correct okay
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's the unique program
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
and page 174 is the governor's
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund
 
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
under the unique program madam chair
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
this is mike hoffman
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
um if i can interrupt for a second sure
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
monica just emailed you a copy of the
 
02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
budget that the committee members are
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget so
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's a pdf it should arrive in a second
 
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:03.349 align:start position:0%
it's a pdf it should arrive in a second
there

02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
it'll help us all be looking at apples
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
oranges and apples thank you i apologize
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
about that yeah representation while
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
we're sure he's waiting for the email to
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
come in
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh thanks man of chairs so before we get
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
too far from house bill 2 is there any
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
college tuition advisory
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
name is now being changed to just simply
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship commission and the advisory
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
being removed from that
 
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
i am not familiar with the changes that
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
were proposed
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
in this in this budget um
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
i was only informed that um
 
02:29:50.469 --> 02:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
there was going to be this new proposal
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
this new program
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
um but but the la the language uh being
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
recommended i
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
i am not familiar with um the details
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh thanks thanks madam chair okay we
 
02:30:04.399 --> 02:30:05.190 align:start position:0%
uh thanks thanks madam chair okay we
probably

02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be able to approve
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
anything until we find out who's
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
responsible because we're not
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
grandma strong okay please continue did
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
you get the email
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
and it's page 173 i just want to make
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
sure i'm on the
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
on the same page the unique program is
 
02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
on page 173 and that's where it starts
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
okay please continue
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
so i'll move on to um the governance
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
that was um that is um we included that
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
in our agency budget we included that in
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
under the prioritized needs
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
but in the governor's proposal um this
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
program has been funded again at the
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
same amount of three million
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
in this is uh general fund a general
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
um the other portions of the budget are
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
um the l-chip program that again is also
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
another pass-through grant or we just
 
02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:19.830 align:start position:0%
another pass-through grant or we just
house

02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
the appropriation for this program and
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
the community development
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
block grant that's another amount that
 
02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
is just being housed in our in our
 
02:31:27.439 --> 02:31:28.389 align:start position:0%
is just being housed in our in our
budget

02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
we simply uh distribute those funds yes
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
both of them come in and talk to us so
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay you're off the hook
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
the um the other piece i would like to
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
mention is our unrestricted
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
revenue related to abandoned property we
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
have um
 
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
we have budget and fiscal year 22 we
 
02:31:49.990 --> 02:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
have budgeted
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
16.8 million and then fiscal year 23
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
18.4 million and that is um
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
really based on our 10-year projection
 
02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:01.590 align:start position:0%
really based on our 10-year projection
um

02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
just because it's difficult to estimate
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
how much we're going to
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually receive and is cheat to the
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
but um but we believe we're going to be
 
02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:11.590 align:start position:0%
but um but we believe we're going to be
um

02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know close to this estimate um this
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
year we're not budgeting for
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
interest uh we don't anticipate any
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
interest um
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
to be recorded as revenue we hope to
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
generate interest to pay our bank
 
02:32:26.469 --> 02:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
cost and that's due to the um
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
low interest rate environment that we're
 
02:32:28.319 --> 02:32:30.550 align:start position:0%
low interest rate environment that we're
in

02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
and i guess um you know the last piece
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
that i i want to mention as part of this
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
presentation i was i was
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
asked to comment on the um contingent
 
02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:39.750 align:start position:0%
asked to comment on the um contingent
limit

02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
limit
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
increase or or the additional um
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
debt guarantee that is being proposed in
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
um what section is that and that is
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
since section 115
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
and um so husband stu is proposing this
 
02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:02.309 align:start position:0%
and um so husband stu is proposing this
increase

02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
of 100 million for for manufacturing or
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
industrial projects in the biotechnology
 
02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:09.990 align:start position:0%
industrial projects in the biotechnology
sector

02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
sector
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
and it's also increasing the unified
 
02:33:12.479 --> 02:33:13.510 align:start position:0%
and it's also increasing the unified
contingent

02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
contingent
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
limit um by 35 million
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
and um the question that was posted to
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
me is this will have any effect or
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
impact on the general fund
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
and um what i will say is um
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
this increase won't uh impact the
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
general fund directly
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
what um what we do with guaranteed debt
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
um debt to the state guarantees
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
we we include that debt and we consider
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
that as part of our overall debt and the
 
02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:45.910 align:start position:0%
that as part of our overall debt and the
potential

02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:33:48.309 --> 02:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
of the state assuming that liabilities
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
so we include that in our debt
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
affordability study that we prepare
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
and for the most part the to guarantee
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
that does not impact
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
um our debt to revenue ratios that we
 
02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
use to
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
essentially measure our offer
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
our data affordability by increasing
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
um the limit by essentially 135 million
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
by itself it wouldn't impact our crew
 
02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:18.230 align:start position:0%
by itself it wouldn't impact our crew
rating

02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
rating
 
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
or our ability to to to issue more bonds
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
or that
 
02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
be by itself but if the state
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
would ever um have to assume that debt
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
because because of the bonds were
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
defaulted the loans were defaulted
 
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
then at that point the state will have
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
to issue that amount
 
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
and and that would be probably the time
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
when um
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
the rating agencies will pay attention
 
02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
to that um
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
even the consideration of having to
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
assume that debt
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
would probably trigger um a credit
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
um action that would that could
 
02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:56.630 align:start position:0%
um action that would that could
potentially

02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
impact the state negatively but again
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
by itself increasing the limit
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't impact the state it's just
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that possibility of
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
issuing that debt that will do something
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
that could
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
um impact natively the state
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
so with that um i think i cover
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
everything that i wanted to cover today
 
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
i will be happy to answer any questions
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
on on anything um that was yellow
 
02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
apparently not although usually as soon
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
as i say apparently not somebody says no
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
i thought of one but
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions thank you very
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
much for being with us this morning we
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
and we are going to it's about
 
02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
seven minutes before twelve we are going
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
to take a lunch break until one o'clock
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock we're going to go over
 
02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock we're going to go over
the

02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
hp2 sections related to oplc
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
we heard their budget presentation in
 
02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:15.750 align:start position:0%
we heard their budget presentation in
detail

02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
detail
 
02:36:18.389 --> 02:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
and although lindsey courtney spoke
 
02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
sections in hp2 at that time we only had
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
the draft copy
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
so we need to review those to make sure
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
what they were and we also have a
 
02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:31.429 align:start position:0%
what they were and we also have a
section

02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
about uh workers comm
 
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's workers training
 
02:36:38.790 --> 02:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
labor's got something in there about
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
training ken merrifield talked about it
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
but again we didn't have
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
final copy of hb2 at that time so
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 130
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
we will talk about those sections
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
and otherwise we are going to be in
