sure so Mr chairman would you would the
 
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
committee like to hear how the current
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
data transfer for snap and TANF Works in
 
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.409 align:start position:0%
data transfer for snap and TANF Works in
practice

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
that would be fine and how this may go a
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
similar path yes okay I'll make you go
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
ahead and turn it over to Deb
 
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not a technology person
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm well aware of our process and
 
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
procedures and I work very closely with
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
our systems folks so right now we do
 
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
have a data share agreement with the
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
um and we do what we call Direct
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
certification for our snap households
 
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
that are interested as well as our TANF
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
population direct certification
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
basically means if a individual tells us
 
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
during their eligibility interview when
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
they're applying for the snap or TANF
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
program when we ask the question would
 
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
you like your information shared with
 
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to allow
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
them to understand that you will be
 
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced lunch
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
based on their eligibility with our
 
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
program if they say yes we have a little
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
box in the system that we can check off
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
if they say no it is their prerogative
 
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 align:start position:0%
to ask us not to share the information
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
the system is then designed to I'll say
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
pull all those cases that have said yes
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
create a data file that is then shared
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education the
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
only information are household names and
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
information that goes over to the
 
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
Department of Education are those that
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
have identified for us that they're
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
interested in the free reduced lunch
 
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.290 align:start position:0%
interested in the free reduced lunch
program

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 align:start position:0%
we would be looking to do the Medicaid
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
in the same way so we would give them an
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt out during their eligibility
 
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
interview with our eligibility workers
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
and again create a file that would only
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
share their information if they have
 
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
at to that point are there any questions
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
of them on how that is that in fact
 
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
working with that
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
that condition that box where they check
 
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
obvious or no is put is that in place
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
right now I believe it was in place
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
until a couple of years ago I was trying
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
to identify why what might have proper
 
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
prior management team to review uh to
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
remove it but we are looking to
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
re-establish it so it's in um coincides
 
00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
with what we would be doing with
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid yes represent Cornell Thank you
 
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
coming here to answer all our questions
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try is there is there a
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
large difference in number of the of the
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
people who would receive
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
um free and we just lunch if they agreed
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
to the Medicaid being shared as compared
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
to the snap and TANF so it's
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
anticipatory so um our snap and Tiana
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
households are very eager for their
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
information to be shared
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
um so basically what it also allows or
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
it benefits the the household as they
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
then do not need to um complete the
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
application at the at the school level
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
there it's kind of seamless behind the
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
scenes for them the Medicaid population
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
we honestly we don't know
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
um if they are already receiving snap
 
00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
and tan if they're already on the file
 
00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:57.469 align:start position:0%
and tan if they're already on the file
anyway

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
um they are a population that pretty
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
much I'd say you know I always hesitate
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
to say 100 of the time but I think it's
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
like pretty close to 99 of the time
 
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
they're they're looking for their
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
information to be shared we could have
 
00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
different income guidelines in different
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
populations that are just maybe
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
receiving uh households that are
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
receiving just Medicaid
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
um that may or may not want their
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
information shared they're not as if
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
they're not receiving any other
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
eligibility programs from us our thought
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
process around this is they could just
 
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
not be accustomed to receiving much more
 
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
than Medicaid so I think personally we
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
need to just be sensitive to how they
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
feel about that for themselves or their
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
children being identified I mean we
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
don't they don't need an application but
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
somehow kids know what kids are getting
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch I think when
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
they're aligned so you know we have a
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
lot of self-employed households
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
um that are utilizing the Children's
 
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program because there's
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
self-employed and at least they can get
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
their children and what we don't know
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
until it starts or are they going to be
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
as eager to be included or not because
 
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
then I personally think there's still
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
there's still some visual if you will
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
once the kids are in school so I don't
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
know the other households are receiving
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
lots of services so they're pretty
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
accustomed to it
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
represent you had your hand up and then
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you very
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and thanks for joining us
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
this morning um all of you thank you
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
um is the is the information that's
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
shared sufficient for the Department to
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
determine whether a student is eligible
 
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
for a free or a reduced
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah so in snap and TANF if they are
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
receiving snap or tnf which is the cash
 
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
program with us the arrangement with
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
those feds is that they are they just
 
00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:44.899 align:start position:0%
get free the file goes over free
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's going to be very different
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to differentiate
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
between the income guidelines for free
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
or reduced and the system is my systems
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
folks are well aware of that
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
differentiation and will not have any
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
problem doing it that way I rather
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
concern when we eventually get there is
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
just ensuring that Doe can also accept a
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
file that's very different than what
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
they're accustomed to accepting because
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
right now it just goes well follow up on
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
this yes it would which is exactly what
 
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
you were just saying so this sort of
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
goes over to to Mark I think
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what they can receive
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
make a determination in terms of whether
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
student is eligible for free or reduced
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
transmit that and from that information
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
would then need to be transmitted to the
 
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.060 align:start position:0%
district for input into point of sale
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's correct so the department is you
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
know we don't have a fiscal note
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
published yet but we are expecting we'll
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
need contract we'll have to we'll need
 
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
an amended increase in our contract
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
Appropriations because we'll have to
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
amend our systems our software systems
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
are in-house built to receive that file
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
and disseminate the information
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
correctly and with a new level of
 
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
precision that we're not used to doing
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
so we know we can do it we're just going
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
to need to pay for it and make those
 
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:05.339 align:start position:0%
amendments in our software great thanks
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
so are you talking about another
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
individual around 160 thousand dollars
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
under forty five thousand dollars uh not
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
this would be um I'd have to look at the
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on what we asked for but um
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
just a contract Amendment
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
um I mean we can talk to finance about
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
that about how much they'd be willing to
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
appropriate in our contract line item in
 
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
our budget but it would be a one-time
 
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
amendment to our
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
um contract so our software developer
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
can make those modifications and then
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance with be an existing
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
existing expense in our contract with
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
our software developers I'll leave that
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
to finance representative cordelli and
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all for being here
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if if I heard correctly
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
but it sounded like with Medicaid there
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
had been an opt-in of some sorts that
 
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
had been stopped by a previous
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
administration but you're looking to
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
start up again I'm maybe you could clear
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
all that no it's not with Medicaid
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
because we're not doing anything in the
 
00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459 align:start position:0%
Medicaid space right now it's with the
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
snap and tan of households okay
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
um but the opt-in had been stopped for a
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
while for snap and TANF but you're
 
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
looking to restart that yes okay systems
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
will run this thing okay follow-up yes
 
00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:16.690 align:start position:0%
will run this thing okay follow-up yes
um

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:16.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.290 align:start position:0%
um
maybe

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959 align:start position:0%
um during the time you're uh up there
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to hear more about the data
 
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
matching process all also but um you
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
know maybe there's other questions to
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
take before that
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
yeah before I go around I'll get there
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
um represent Heath was in a discussion
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
just the other day on this and represent
 
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
Heath were there any findings or
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions that came up that really need
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
further resolve from that that committee
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
that you're on well um I Mary Heath and
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
I'm actually on division two in finance
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
and um left to be here in education
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
um yesterday uh we were having an
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
information session with doe and Mark
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
was quite helpful
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
um what came up yesterday
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
um in our discussion around adequacy
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
funding the fact that free reduced lunch
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
is one of the categories that that
 
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.810 align:start position:0%
is one of the categories that that
drives

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
drives
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
um funding for school districts we've
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
just gone through covid
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
um During the period of covid
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
um everybody was eligible for Freedom
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch all kids could eat so that
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
school districts got away from doing the
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
freedom reduced lunch forms so there's
 
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
another aspect that has occurred and
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
Mark please correct me if I'm not doing
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
this right because we just had this
 
00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:40.019 align:start position:0%
conversation yesterday
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
you were using during the covet pandemic
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
the 2019 data and the governor and the
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
doe they worked out that and they
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
extended that through 2023
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
yes the adequacy formula modified f r
 
00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
data for fiscal year 23 formula fiscal
 
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
year 24 formula does not have a
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
modification on the fnr data so fiscal
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
year 23 we used we counted about 40 000
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
f r students Statewide because we
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
modified the data to match pre-pandemic
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
levels ratios pre-pandemic ratios what
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
we're carrying for fiscal year 24 is
 
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
around 38 39 000 f r students and we
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
think there is likely more fnr students
 
00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:24.779 align:start position:0%
out there than what the data suggests we
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
told supers all the time as everyone in
 
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
this committee knows get your fnr
 
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
applications in get them in there
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
important they're important for not only
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
feeding kids but for the adequacy
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
formula so try your best
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll it's we'll find out at the end
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the year how how successful they were
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
getting those fnr numbers up but that's
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
a that's a funding formula challenge is
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
the fnr numbers thank you so if I may
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so local school districts right now
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I've had some calls about how come my
 
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
school district isn't going to get as
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
much money
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
um again I've tried to explain all the
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
scenarios that come about so with a
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
reduced number of F and our numbers as
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
well as a reduced student count
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
school districts may be seeing
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
reductions so in my mind I think it also
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
um my work on the direct certification
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
with with representative umberger last
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
year brought home to me the importance
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
that we really have valid data for all
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
the sources that need this data Mark do
 
00:15:33.129 --> 00:15:33.139 align:start position:0%
you concur with that
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
I what I can say is that um
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the the data sort of is what
 
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
um the data has been uh uh it's been
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
challenging to get accurate data during
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
um we're going back to normal processes
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
so normal processes might bring us back
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
to normal data sets and if we look at
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
the fnr ratios after this school year is
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
completed we might see
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
um we might see nut ratios that go back
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
to normal or status quo
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
um and those might be as accurate as
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
what leads to historically seeing
 
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
um the the concept of Medicaid direct
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
cert would potentially allow us we don't
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
know because the data we're just running
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
hypothetical data but it would
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
theoretically allow us to identify more
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
students in poverty than it would be a
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
new tool in our toolbox to identify more
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
students in poverty so if we were to go
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
ahead with Medicaid direct cert and
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
assuming the Medicaid data the Medicaid
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
data is a little bit inflated at the
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
moment because there's no um they're not
 
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
kicking uh they're not disenrolling
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
people but if we assume Medicaid data
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
accurately captures income and it
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
actually accurately allows us to to
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
understand which students are at what
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
income levels then we identify more
 
00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:47.579 align:start position:0%
students of poverty we're using a new
 
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
tool that we do not have and so that
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
would make the data more accurate so to
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
make a long story short in looking at
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
our FY 23 data where we're okay by 24
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
the there's a gap and if we were in the
 
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:05.579 align:start position:0%
direct program right now we may not have
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
as much of a gap that we would have
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
known data coming in is that right
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's a fair that's a fair statement
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I appreciate it good
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you for taking my
 
00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:20.329 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you for taking my
questions

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
um two simple one question but those
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
three little thoughts two simple ones
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
um can you what is the acronym Tana
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
stand for
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
oh temporary assistance to needy
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
families it's a cash and Medicaid
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
Program okay thank you so it's usually
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
well it's parents or Guardians well soon
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
to be Guardians those that are taking
 
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
care of children and are in need for
 
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
financially and Medicaid all right thank
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
you and the second part is uh on the
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
snap and the I always wouldn't be tan as
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
because temporary is that a annual uh
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility or that once
 
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
so the both of those programs are what
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
we call recertified so families have to
 
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
re-certify and up constantly give us
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
current information and the
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
recertifications are done every six
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
months every six months okay great
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
because we have some programs here that
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
you certify once and never come back
 
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:11.900 align:start position:0%
again okay and
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
the third one is the most important one
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
or at least for me anyhow uh if the free
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
and reduced categories uh that we have
 
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:24.740 align:start position:0%
now uh with the eligibility that
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
125-ish 130 or you know we're going
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
right and we expand that to from 186 to
 
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
300 for reduce
 
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
okay right now we choose the the top
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
level is 186. 185 okay 25. thank you so
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
186 from my thinking 186 up to 300. if
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
that was passed because that's the bill
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's on the table if that was passed
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
would the program that Mark is talking
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
about you're talking about would that be
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
able to be tweaked to capture those
 
00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:02.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you thank you Mr
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
so something you said tweaked a thought
 
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
in my head
 
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.890 align:start position:0%
in my head
um

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
so you have people who let's say like
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
when my granddaughter when we were
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
caring for my granddaughter and we
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
applied so that she would have medical
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
um we didn't need anything else right
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we wanted her to have medical and
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
so this would be something
 
00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:44.090 align:start position:0%
so this would be something
would

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
would she have been would she then be
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
counted into the total or not into the
 
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.909 align:start position:0%
counted into the total or not into the
total

00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
or would it be up to us to check the box
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
or not check the box yes so the way it
 
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
would be when you came in you applied
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
you went through a process you you spoke
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
with an eligibility determination worker
 
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
they took all your information down and
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
during that process you would have been
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
asked the question would you like us to
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
share your information with the
 
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
so she would be eligible for free and
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
reduced school lunch
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
without needing to apply at the school
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
okay and then you said yes then we would
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
have you included in the file transfer
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you will if you said no not
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
interested for whatever your reasons
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
none of our business you would not be
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
included in the file that was
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
transferred okay and and would this be
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
then a good reason to keep it opt in
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just automatically
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
counting her because she didn't need
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
anything but medical and she certainly
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
didn't want school lunches
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
right so in our eligibility system once
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
you say yes or no we don't go any
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
further with it then if you're on the
 
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
yes because you chose yes your
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
information would then go over to the
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
doe file and she would be eligible the
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
way it is set up now I don't know if
 
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
there will be any changes but they don't
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
have to fill out an application they're
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
directly certified is what we're doing
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
shoot somebody at the school would give
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
her whatever she needed to walk through
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
the line and get her meals free if you
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
said no it just stays self-contained in
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
our system there's nothing else at all
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
that happens with the information we
 
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
cannot share anywhere else while we are
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
a state system it's called the new
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
height system as our eligibility
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
determination system it is considered a
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
state system because it belongs to the
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
but it is also self-contained and we are
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
very governed by all the privacy of our
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
federal Partners on what goes where and
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
how we set that up thank you very much
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
there'd be no other information going so
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
how many people are in Medicaid right
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
right now and how are you going to deal
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
with the issue when we get if 601 goes
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
forward how are we going to get that box
 
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
checked on those that are already in the
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
program Yeah so basically we would have
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
to determine that to be honest like it
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
one thing that always is successful for
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
us when we're making a change is to what
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
we call
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
um address or catch the families at
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
their recertification appointment but
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
they I do believe I don't have systems
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
with me today
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
um but some things that we have done in
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
the past as we can kind of do we might
 
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
do a query back and just kind of be able
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
to they can still capture we all we have
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
all their income information within the
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
system so they would have to just design
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
the system to run a query as we call it
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
to kind of catch those families
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say definitively no
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
big deal but our systems folks are
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
pretty great and these kinds of things
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
which we dapple in all the time so I
 
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
think there's ways we could still
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
identify them we'd want to get a hold of
 
00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:44.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
we'd have to probably I'm just thinking
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
a little out of the box of things we've
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
done in the past they might get a letter
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
that identifies that we are able to
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
engage in this process now with the
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Education ask them to
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
check it off and send it in to us
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
um make a phone call to let us know
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
they're interested there's a few
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
different things again I'm a little
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
outside the box because we don't we
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
don't have anything designed but ways
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
that we've worked backwards in the past
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
are through those Avenues they would
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
still have an opportunity to opt in or
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.610 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
how long would it take to get this thing
 
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.090 align:start position:0%
how long would it take to get this thing
going

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.529 align:start position:0%
going
ah

00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
so right now the system is very bogged
 
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
down with what we're calling all the
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
Medicaid unwind and changes that are
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
needing to happen in that area so
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
anything that we're asking the system to
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
do new
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
um we're always asking them to do
 
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.490 align:start position:0%
um we're always asking them to do
something

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:36.500 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
always we're probably I'm going to say
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
at least nine months to a year out
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
before they could take on the project
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
can't you just talk to your phone and
 
00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:49.340 align:start position:0%
say Hey Siri
 
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:52.580 align:start position:0%
I could step out and phone a friend
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't phone a friend earlier but
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
just just on the timing of the all of
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
this um there's some unknowns but right
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
now the pilot is not open so normally
 
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
the way the pilot worked last year the
 
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
deadline was September 30th 2022 and
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
then this the Medicaid director
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
legislation did not uh become a law so
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
we anticipate them to kind of sort of
 
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
open the pilot back up and allow us to
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
potentially get an application in by
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
September 30th 2023 3 which would impact
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
the 24-25 school year for for nutrition
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
purposes it would impact the fiscal year
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
26 adequacy formula that's if they open
 
00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:33.539 align:start position:0%
up the pilot they have not opened up the
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
pilot so September 30th night uh 2023 is
 
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
not a deadline available to us so it's
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
the next year so the early this could
 
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
impact on a school year under current
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
Paul USDA policy the earliest this could
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
impact is um school year 26 which is
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
adequacy 27 but um we'll we'll let you
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
know if USDA opens it back up I I don't
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
know exactly the reason why they closed
 
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
the pilot
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
um so we kind of anticipate them to open
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
it back up but
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
um that's that's unknown at the moment
 
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
okay further questions represent Myler
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair a couple questions
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
one how many are in the pilot uh and has
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
there been any uh any results of the
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
pilot that you can let us know what's
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
going on are you talking about how many
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
states are in it yeah yeah I think we
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
heard weird testimony I don't know this
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
for myself but we heard testimony that
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
39 states are in the pilot
 
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
um as far as results I only have
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information from from other
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
states I've talked to
 
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
um just that the benefits that they it's
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
it's more the policy benefits of of
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
people not uh uh complaining about the
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
applications because they went forward
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
and actually stopped it like
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts stopped uh requiring
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
application are you implementing
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
applications and they felt um that was a
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
positive policy change from their
 
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.149 align:start position:0%
positive policy change from their
perspective

00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
um but that's I don't can't tell you any
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
results of funding or nutrition just a
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up please go ahead of those 39
 
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
states are they opt in or opt out
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
we we want to know that or um I don't
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
know that okay thank you
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you all for
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
your help
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
do we know
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
what percent of
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
children who have Medicaid
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps in your example of self-employed
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
people who you know don't have health
 
00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:33.539 align:start position:0%
insurance without buying it so they
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
might get Medicaid for their children
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
what percent of those children wouldn't
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
qualify for free and reduced if they
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
who obtain it
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and oh yes
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
sorry brain cramp
 
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.350 align:start position:0%
sorry brain cramp
um

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
bye for now
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you very much
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Heath uh representative
 
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.130 align:start position:0%
representative Heath uh representative
cordelli

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you uh could you tell me where in
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
the statutes it provides for the snap
 
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
and TANF direct certification data
 
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.149 align:start position:0%
and TANF direct certification data
matching

00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.159 --> 00:27:16.610 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
so the way the
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
yeah it's all federal it's authorized in
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
federal law so it's uh the federal
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
government allows to direct certify and
 
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.210 align:start position:0%
government allows to direct certify and
so

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
um the the Department of Education and
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
Department of DHHS made that decision um
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know when but they made that
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
decision with a federal enabling
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
legislation but there was no State
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation uh they used
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
Federal legislation
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
federal federal law representative Luna
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to sort of get back to
 
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock's question about
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
the resolution of the um the data up to
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
um uh between 186 and 300 percent of the
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
federal poverty guideline and I was
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
wondering does that resolution uh exist
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the would that resolution exist in
 
00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand the question
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is the the fact
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has has expanded
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
medicaid Provisions does that provide
 
00:28:29.409 --> 00:28:29.419 align:start position:0%
greater uh
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
income resolution in the income data
 
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
that that goes
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
um that I guess that covers families
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
with incomes between
 
00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:45.419 align:start position:0%
um 186 and 300 of the federal poverty
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
guideline and if we were not to have
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid would that
 
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
um would that income data no longer you
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
know be available through through our
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
through the Medicaid
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
um data I think the only thing I could
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
say I'm trying to grasp of a question as
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
well is we will only have data available
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
for those that have been determined
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for a program that we're
 
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.590 align:start position:0%
eligible for a program that we're
offering

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
offering
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
right right so that's that I think
 
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:19.580 align:start position:0%
that's close to the answer um
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
but but does does the fact that we have
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
 
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.149 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
um

00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:28.210 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:28.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
get us that that information uh in the
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
event we were not to have expanded
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid would we be able to uh know
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
when somebody's at 300 percent of the
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level I would say no I
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
think I'm on your path so basically if
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
we did not have expanded Medicaid and
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
somebody came through the door and
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
applied and we didn't have expanded
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
medicaid they would be denied they would
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
be determined denied for whatever they
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
were applying for right they weren't
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
eligible and then once someone is not
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
eligible their information is really not
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
captured and maintained in the system
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing so there would be no way for us
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
to do that right so so Mr chair so uh
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
just just a comment on that so I think
 
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:15.539 align:start position:0%
to to representative woodcock's um
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
question uh it really would be it seems
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
to me that it would be incumbent that
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
um be in place to to capture that um
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
those those families that are between
 
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
186 and 300 of the federal poverty
 
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.690 align:start position:0%
186 and 300 of the federal poverty
guideline

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
guideline
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
is that how you're taking this yes sir
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
all right just to clarify something uh
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
so what representative Woodcock is
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
discussing and I believe he has a bill
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
to to try to increase
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
um state aid to community to feed
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
students that are between 186 and 300 we
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
cannot use Medicaid data for that we
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
cannot use Medicaid data for that
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
purpose we're only restricted to use
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data as CMS allows the center
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid services allows and the
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
center for Medicaid services is not
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
going to allow us to use Medicaid data
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
unless it's a particular program that
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
program it being the federal fnr program
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
so CMS would not allow us to grab income
 
00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
data from for someone over 1 185 to
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
identify them for a state-run program I
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
believe that's my understanding and my
 
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
research on this topic
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
yeah great uh yeah that's correct I can
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
give you the citation on that there's a
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
very specific uh federal statute on what
 
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
we can and can't share for Medicaid
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
purposes and that's a 42 USC 1396 a
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:44.649 align:start position:0%
 
um a

00:31:44.649 --> 00:31:44.659 align:start position:0%
um a
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
so I have it right here
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful IR 1396
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
aaa7 yeah yeah it's it's the Social
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
Security Act is confusing to read as you
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
probably know representative Woodcock
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that Mark and all three
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
of you uh that that response was is um
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
great information not for happy with it
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
with great information
 
00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:11.470 align:start position:0%
with great information
um

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
if if the bill uh so you just tell them
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
you can't direct start that 186 to 300.
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
good it wouldn't be all good for initial
 
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:22.460 align:start position:0%
Medicaid basically what you're saying
 
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:25.820 align:start position:0%
what way we will be able to capture that
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
electronically if there is any that you
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
can determine beyond the old-fashioned
 
00:32:30.179 --> 00:32:33.649 align:start position:0%
can determine beyond the old-fashioned
paper

00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
not aware of any other methodology that
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
would be legal for us to to do that
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
let's just keep our questions right on
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
601 yeah I know you're trying to tie it
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
in with another bill but uh oh I
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that no I know you wouldn't
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
people from Conway tend to do strange
 
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.490 align:start position:0%
people from Conway tend to do strange
things

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.090 align:start position:0%
things
um

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions yeah yeah
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
um if we
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
if rather than participating when it
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
comes if it comes in the federal program
 
00:33:09.649 --> 00:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
if we decide to do this as a state
 
00:33:09.659 --> 00:33:10.630 align:start position:0%
if we decide to do this as a state
program

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
and do you need additional
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
permissions whatever to be able to use
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
for people who opt in
 
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
um in order to direct certify free and
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
my defer to rock so just so I understand
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
your question correctly if we were to
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
avoid or not utilize the federal program
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
if we were just to utilize a state
 
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
program my read of federal statute is
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
that we can release Medicaid data or
 
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
utilize Medicaid data only for the
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
purposes of administering the Medicaid
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
Program or this particular program
 
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
there's a specific carve out in that
 
00:33:53.409 --> 00:33:53.419 align:start position:0%
citation I gave you
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
a minute ago so I don't know if we could
 
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.769 align:start position:0%
a minute ago so I don't know if we could
utilize

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data just for a state run
 
00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
program I don't believe we could
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
I no I meant for the federal free and
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
reduced program do you need anything can
 
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.210 align:start position:0%
reduced program do you need anything can
you

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
use the State Medicaid information to
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
direct certify
 
00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:20.339 align:start position:0%
Federal free and reduced program
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
without having to go through that pilot
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
program that's my question yeah I don't
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you can you refresh my memory
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
here when we did expanded medicaid years
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
back it was around fifty thousand folks
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
were trying to expand
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
I've heard through the Bia that numbers
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
are doubling
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
I can provide the committee with updated
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
numbers from the department's website
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't have that offhand I had it
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
with me last time but the the number has
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
gotten out of my head at this point but
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
I can easily get that it's right on the
 
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
Department's website I can provide it
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's on the website we can pick it up
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
yeah if you go to the uh the Medicaid
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
section on the website there's a little
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
tab about enrollment data and it's easy
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
to find at least I think it is and not
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent cordelli uh thank you
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up with a prior
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
question about the uh snap and TANF
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
direct certification
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
um is that in rules for the uh either
 
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.650 align:start position:0%
um is that in rules for the uh either
Department

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:26.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not overly familiar with the snap
 
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
antenna program because it's a bit
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
outside of Medicaid
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
um do you have you can get back to us I
 
00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
further further what about the doe yeah
 
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
not in any nhed uh rules not in rules
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
as a further further questions I have
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
one um we've oftentimes heard
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell I both heard this
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
that when we're dealing with Carl
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
Perkins bunny which is another Federal
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
grant goes to Career Technical education
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
within that formula there is a poverty
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh element which is in that equation
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
for the numbers that we receive from the
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
federal government would if we got into
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid direct program and our
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
numbers were to increase in in our free
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
and reduced meals would those then also
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
apply that increase also carry over into
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
our other federal grants which are
 
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:27.020 align:start position:0%
determined based on poverty
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
so generally speaking uh just a a
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
generally the rule for federal grants is
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
the federal government isn't a huge fan
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
of f r number they like the U.S census
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
data for their poverty metrics New
 
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a fan of f r data because
 
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
we use almost all of our allocations use
 
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
fnr data um so the way just generally I
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
think this is Trooper Perkins I think
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
this this is true for title one this is
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
true for a lot of Grants
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
um uh they allocate to the 50 states and
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
the territories using U.S census data
 
00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
which our fnr numbers would have no
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
impact on that's based on U.S census's
 
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.390 align:start position:0%
impact on that's based on U.S census's
methodology

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
and uh and then we allocate out to the
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
districts or
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah out to the districts
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
um using fnr data so it's going to
 
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
change and that's actually
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to change the way in which we
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
allocate out to the district so if we
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
have 100 million dollars and this
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct cert works really well
 
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
for certain communities they'll receive
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
more portion of that 100 million dollars
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
um in that hypothetical so it's going to
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
change the way we distribute the state
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
distributes out to the uh districts
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
that interrupt interrupted my brain but
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
it was very important
 
00:37:48.359 --> 00:37:49.310 align:start position:0%
it was very important
um

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
if we do the federal Medicaid direct can
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
we still do opt-in opt out or will all
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
of our data
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
end up being shared with the federal
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
government which
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
Medicaid people may not want their
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
information shared with the federal
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
government so how will that end up
 
00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:17.990 align:start position:0%
government so how will that end up
working

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'll have DHS speak but NHS is not
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
giving any individual information to the
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
federal government if the federal
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
government asks for information it's
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a roll-up but we're not
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
giving any student information to the
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
or or parent or any individualized
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
information to the federal government
 
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
and the department plans to design the
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
system with the opt-in opt out and as we
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
spoke about previously if you opt out
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
don't want it to go it doesn't go beyond
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
our system that stays in-house goes
 
00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:50.210 align:start position:0%
our system that stays in-house goes
nowhere

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
nowhere
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
well I want to can we just go over the
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
the data matching
 
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.349 align:start position:0%
the data matching
sure

00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
how would the data matching
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
it work yeah it's the way the current
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
system works and um I know DHS can
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
explain it in more detail but just to do
 
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
a high level explanation it's
 
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.010 align:start position:0%
a high level explanation it's
essentially

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.730 align:start position:0%
essentially
um

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
DHHS has their data which is snap and
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
TANF um and then if Medicaid were added
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
would be Medicaid included
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
um the way we match it's basically I
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
like to say A robot's doing it it's a
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
computer doing it it's not a human doing
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
it but it's based on an algorithm
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
um and the algorithm is matching date of
 
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
birth first name last name and residence
 
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
um I believe in gender as well and it
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
has a particular algorithm to a match to
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
know this this is the exact same person
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
the person then the DHHS data set is the
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
same person we have in our school
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
information systems so the robot's doing
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
that matching
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a pretty good formula or
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
algorithm because it's it's it gets a
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
lot of them sometimes it kicks out
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
something and says we're not sure about
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
this do you want to put do you want to
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
double check this and so a human does
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
look at that matching and then goes yes
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
that is a match that's clearly a match
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
Kayla likes to use the example they
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
spelled Caitlyn with a K instead of a c
 
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:07.820 align:start position:0%
but we know this is the same person
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
because of all the other factors so
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
there is some human element to matching
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
but mostly it's done through a computer
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
software program but that's how that
 
00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:19.339 align:start position:0%
those are how those files match
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
anything else from the committee right
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
now I want to just verify
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
um so it's date of birth first and last
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
name residence and gender
 
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
yes and I think middle initials in there
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Deborah and Ralph
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
and Mark
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate your taking the time out
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
of your busy schedules come in here
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
today and help us out with some of these
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Mr
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
chairman I do have the citation I read
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
to you earlier how would you like that
 
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.430 align:start position:0%
to you earlier how would you like that
delivered

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
boy would be great if we just get a copy
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
of that um I can I can give you this
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
copy here or I can send it to you have a
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
fax machine over there you know I do but
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to use it if somebody
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
can go take a picture of it with their
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
camera I'll help you out I don't mind
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
yeah general questions too
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
so not not directed to what you are not
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
directing them but we could take a
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
picture willing yeah yeah but but this
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
is sort of a question sort of going out
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
to the the um the the former uh
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
principles and superintendents who are
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
who are in the room but we've talked
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
about this anecdotally I think around
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
around this table the amount of time
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
that building principles
 
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.510 align:start position:0%
that building principles
um

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
spend trying to chase down a student
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
family paperwork for this and and not
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
just talking about from the standpoint
 
00:41:57.609 --> 00:41:57.619 align:start position:0%
of of um of making sure that that that
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh that kids are are fed certainly
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's important but as Mark
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
pointed out also the the school funding
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
formula has a significant amount of um
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
of of money that's uh that's that's
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
appropriated based on uh our our poverty
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
metric which is which is is gleaned from
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch counts but
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
but Rick I mean you must have some so my
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
experience as a as a principal and and
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
and Cascade is not here as a
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent we have uh representative
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
Woodcock too
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of time in the office with your
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
your secretarial staff I I had an
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
elementary school with about four or 500
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
kids in it and I had three secretaries
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
in the office and one was allocated to
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
do this task uh and getting the
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
paperwork in it took an inordinate
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
amount of time then we're starting to
 
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
sit down together as principals from
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
other schools within the same district
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
trying to match our data this is prior
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
to the use of the technology which we
 
00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:01.220 align:start position:0%
have available right now right yeah
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know we we were actually we were you
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
know we were uh really ahead of things
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
in terms where I was in terms of
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
Technology than they were in the lower
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
48 even because we had to have it so but
 
00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:16.819 align:start position:0%
uh it took a lot of time a lot of money
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh was involved in this uh certainly if
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
we could have something done why I don't
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
like to see robots doing everything but
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know making those decisions and
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
choices but I to me anything we can take
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
the paperwork out of the office and
 
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
having that stuff pile up somewhere else
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
in the central office
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's just horrendous amount of time and
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
paper that we're using
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
reps on Woodcock I don't know if you had
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
the same type of feeling yeah and thank
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
you other than that exactly the same
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
except was worse at the high school
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
because those young because we're very
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
reluctant to saying that the role over
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
now with that doesn't happen is terrific
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh our biggest concern at the high
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
school level was last loss of
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
subscription because we couldn't capture
 
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
those kids yeah we had lost paperwork
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
and backpacks and school bus floors and
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
all this other it blew all over the
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and never got home to Mom
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
and Dad and so we had to chase that down
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and we see a huge waterfall effect
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
between the Middle School and the high
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
school in terms of participation in the
 
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
program huge and and uh there's a lot
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
more to it there uh esteem and all that
 
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.829 align:start position:0%
more to it there uh esteem and all that
other

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
so I want to once again thank you I know
 
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
you got to run to other meetings we have
 
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
other bills which we have to address
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
right now getting into the finance stuff
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
the mark you're not off the hot suit
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much again thank you
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
now is there any more discussion like
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
you were on this yeah on 601 is that 601
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
before we get into we're going with it
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
so so this work session on 601 do you
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
see any uh any
 
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.970 align:start position:0%
see any uh any
um

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
I guess technical amendments that would
 
00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:00.740 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed in this committee
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
uh uh prior to uh hopefully I mean I'm
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
hopefully a successful vote out of
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee a successful vote on the floor
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
and thus going to finance uh with uh
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
with and giving Mark time for a fiscal
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
note and um and costs for the department
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
and things like that what I would
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
suggest I had a long conversation the
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
other day with Karen umberer she's no
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
longer in as a representative but she
 
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
was one that was the cheerleader for
 
00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
um in previous years you well know right
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
and I think yeah and I was we were on
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
that and and uh I think what we have to
 
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
do is in any amending structure which we
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
do we have to work in conjunction with
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
division two
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
and so the next thing that I would do is
 
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
say you know and you know the finding a
 
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
way to protect that information of the
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
parent and allowing the parent doesn't
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
want to enter this program having that
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
opt out that and that was what Karen was
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
talking to me the other day about a
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
wraparound we got fixed this somehow it
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
sounds like we have a possible
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
resolution to how to do that and so that
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
would have to be stipulated with
 
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
anything we do and I'd like to work with
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
division two and this committee together
 
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
to try and get that amending language
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
that's necessary and we're running out
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
of time on it
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of six months should we do
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
the opt out
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
um language yes absolutely yes and
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what I'm saying and
 
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
and then I want but I want to work with
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
you know everybody's been working with
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
these folks right here to make sure we
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
get it written properly and if you have
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
any suggestions of how we might amend
 
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
this bill with opt-out language in in
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
I always make the joke I have six or
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
five attorneys sitting out there I got
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
another one sitting on the bench back
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
there right now and I get six or five
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
different answers yeah Mr chairman I'm
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
happy to provide some draft language for
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
the committee to review and deal with a
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh that would be very very helpful with
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
it and you know and if you could also
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
just uh clean it up a little bit could
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
you also work with Dina Fenton back
 
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
there in the back she's she's the
 
00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:15.560 align:start position:0%

further representative Damon thank you
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just briefly wanted to say
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
this goes back so long in time so quick
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
personal anecdote my mom was a school
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
lunch director in the Berkshires for
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
like 25 or 30 years
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
in a K-12 six town seven Town Regional
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
School District
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
and I so remember her tracking families
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
when the kids would drop off and not
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
return the forms she'd say I know that
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
family will qualify and she personally
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
Reach Out
 
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
on the phone at night before all the
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
technology and here we still are and we
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
haven't made it easy for kids to get fed
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
in the old days though a principal could
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
make that decision
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
and we would check them off and they
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
would be in the program because we knew
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
what the income was
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
we didn't want a kid starving
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay thanks again I've said that several
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
times since I really appreciate it and I
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
would we look forward to any kind of
 
00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:27.349 align:start position:0%
would we look forward to any kind of
hey

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:30.140 align:start position:0%
have a good day
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
pardon me you might just stay right
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh looking at the other uh areas
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
which we want to look at today uh 529 is
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
relative to additional a grants for
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
schools based on free and reduced price
 
00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
meals and fiscal capacity disparity I
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
think that's a good one to just address
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
right now the other ones are relative to
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
relief and calculation and determining
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
grants for adequate education very
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
similar uh 540 relative to adequate
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
education grant amounts for pupils
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services I
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
think we're on the track on the road
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
with a special education services uh
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
um you may have a little bit more
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
information for us on that one so Mark
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
um in looking at 529 and I I
 
00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:23.569 align:start position:0%
um in looking at 529 and I I
representative

00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:23.579 --> 00:49:24.910 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:27.500 align:start position:0%
you know fellows is there
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
relative to the additional grants for
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
schools based on free and reduced price
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
meals and fiscal capacity
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid can you speak a little bit
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
to that where we are on that or are
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
there questions for our Mark first let's
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
go that way are there questions from the
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
committee that you want me to represent
 
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.790 align:start position:0%
committee that you want me to represent
Lexus

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
all of this conversation and something
 
00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:55.339 align:start position:0%
that was said about other states got me
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
wondering and I don't know whether this
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
is something you can answer
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
but is there a reason why the state does
 
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
not our state uses free and reduced
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
lunch rather than
 
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.230 align:start position:0%
lunch rather than
um

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
Census Data because apparently other
 
00:50:17.569 --> 00:50:17.579 align:start position:0%
states do and can you explain any of
 
00:50:17.579 --> 00:50:19.130 align:start position:0%
states do and can you explain any of
that

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
so I can only explain just sort of the
 
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:25.700 align:start position:0%
the oral history that I've received uh
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
historically when people look at census
 
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
data and they look at fnr data
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
the Census Data disorder doesn't pass
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
the smell test so there's certain
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
communities that all of us know are are
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of wealthy and they're showing up
 
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.530 align:start position:0%
kind of wealthy and they're showing up
as

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:41.540 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
as poor essentially so I think that's a
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
historical like this historical policy
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
decision that's meant to rely on f r
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
data census data is a survey survey has
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
a margin of error so when you count a
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
student there's
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's no real margin of error you're
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
not surveying them and asking them how
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
much income there is there's a student
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
there's documentation to support that
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's a student is in poverty so the
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is just relied on
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
having a student having that full audit
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
Trail to know if that student's in
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
poverty or a census is however U.S
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
census does their methodology their
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
methodology it may have improved over
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
the years but um the state has just
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
historically felt f r numbers were more
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
reliable than the census
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Jefferson Belcher thank you Mr
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
chair just to follow up on that line of
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
thought if the Census Data isn't great
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
do you are you aware of any data points
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
that are comparable in um to the free
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
lunch program that are available either
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
from the federal government freely with
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
no strings attached or that exist within
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
so we've studied this before
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
um so ideally if the IRS would open up
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
their Data Systems which they're not um
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
we would have great information that's
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
not available to us
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
which is a good thing I think
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
um uh so no there's no um some states
 
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
have income taxes so they have a lot of
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
income data on their families we don't
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
have an income tax
 
00:52:17.579 --> 00:52:18.170 align:start position:0%
have an income tax
um

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
people have looked at other data sets
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
they're usually the problem with
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
adequacy is we calculate adequacy at the
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
very granular Municipal level some of
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
the employment security data is really
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
rolled up and they're not going to
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
capture a small small town another
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
unique thing about New England and New
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we have 244 municipalities
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
in a very small area some of the bigger
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
states are more County run and they roll
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
up their they roll up their data to a
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
larger thing a larger entity so they
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
don't have to get as granular so here in
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we do have to get granular
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
we do have to calculate at the very
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
Municipal level so the only data sets
 
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
that really allow us to calculate at the
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
municipal level is f and our data
 
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data and then data we don't
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
have access to which would be like the
 
00:53:01.559 --> 00:53:02.690 align:start position:0%
have access to which would be like the
IRS

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
IRS
 
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:03.290 align:start position:0%
IRS
um

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
and then your census data um but those
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
are the kind of options available to us
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
there's no other no one's ever found
 
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
another data set that is really
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
satisfies all those needs to be accurate
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
be granular and something we can easily
 
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
roll into our in allocations
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
we have a grant we call the
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I think it was it's somewhere maybe
 
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
14 million dollars 14 plus million
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
dollars but it's going to decline by
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
about five million dollars why is that
 
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.910 align:start position:0%
about five million dollars why is that
so

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
um the extraordinary needs Grant is uh
 
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
it's a it first produces a metric which
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
is equalized valuation over F and our
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
numbers yes and then that um if you have
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of property value
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
um you have high equalized valuation and
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
you have low f r students it produces a
 
00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
high number and um and you get less
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
money or no money and then if you have
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
low property values and
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
um High F and R counts produces a low
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
amount number and you get more money
 
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
based on how the grant structured though
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
the the metrics we're using are set in
 
00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
statute and do not ingest with inflation
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
so right now as property values go up
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to make every Town based on
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
the way the formula is structured every
 
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
town every Community look wealthier
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
because property values are going up so
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
the way we measure property wealth is
 
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.530 align:start position:0%
the way we measure property wealth is
not

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
um to distribute the grant is Frozen in
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
Time based on how it's structured in
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
statute it does not move with inflation
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
um that's one aspect of it the other
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
aspect is declining fnr as we have
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
declining F and R numbers it's going to
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
make students communities look
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
um uh it's proportional but um as we is
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
declining up in our numbers it's going
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
to make students communities look less
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
poor than they were wealthy otherwise
 
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll make them look wealthier so
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
over time the way that grants works it's
 
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.190 align:start position:0%
over time the way that grants works it's
gonna

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
distribute less money because it's going
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
to the the the formula and the grant is
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
going to make it's going to make it seem
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
like communities are wealthier than
 
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they really are because it doesn't
 
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
deal with other Market factors right
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's the subject of the next um Bill
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
too 435 I know and and is the CPI going
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
to fix this it's not going to fix that
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
you could it's going to help but you
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
know on every biennium but it
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to stop inflation from
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
impacting all this so the extraordinary
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
needs Grant isn't adjusted for inflation
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
it's set in stone
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to make it float a
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
little bit better you can make
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
modifications to the formula I think uh
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative Aladdin representative
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
Luna I think we had this conversation a
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
few years ago when you were designing
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity to disparity Aid whether
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
you could let it float or not and um
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
there's no I think we you have to Noodle
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
around with the legislation on how to do
 
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.030 align:start position:0%
around with the legislation on how to do
that

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
um you could probably just come with the
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
the bill that's up next after this one
 
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
um throwing a CPI on the grant is going
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
to boost the numbers so that's going to
 
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
help it flow better
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
um in perpetuity
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
um throwing a CPI the grant amount I
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
think is 650 per each fnr student so you
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
could throw a CPI on that and that would
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
go from 650 to say 680 to 720 and that
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
would help the grant produce more money
 
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
um then you could also put a CPI on the
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
EV values or you could say you could
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
write uh legislation that says this
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
shall track whatever the property
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
division within Dr Ray says is the in
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
change in property value so right now
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
we've had property values go up a lot
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
more than CPI they've gone up 18
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
um because it's CPI is a bundle of
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
services so you could you could you
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
could make amendments to make this thing
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
work to make this grant work uh better
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity and not have this 5
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
million dollar decline but that would
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
require some some amendment to law
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
then the other side of the coin we have
 
00:56:53.329 --> 00:56:53.339 align:start position:0%
a a grant for 17.5 million dollars
 
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
I'll explain that a little bit
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is the this is the
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
challenge with um uh
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
the relief 8 Grant not the extraordinary
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
needs Grant which is a bill before in
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
this work session next to deal with that
 
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
is it's set in stone to be 17.5 million
 
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't float whatever the numbers
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
are it doesn't matter well it does
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
matter because it deals with the
 
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
allocation but it doesn't matter for as
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
far as how much money we spend in total
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's always going to be 17.5 million so
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
we prorated up or prorated Down based on
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
that just based on what set in statute
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
which is 17.5 million uh so getting that
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
formula to float
 
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
um the the bill that you have in uh in
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
front of this committee is we do a CPI
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the grant amounts and so
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
that allows it to grow with inflation
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
um f and R numbers are still going to
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
move around
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so that's going to impact the overall
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
Grant but it's gonna
 
00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
get rid of the proration which we we
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
requested getting rid of the proration
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
because it creates an administrative
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
burden on how we do Cooperative
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
apportionments that's really into the
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
weeds um that's more it's kind of a meat
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
problem but we're asking you to help us
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
out here
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
um because it's a lot of work to track
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
all these dollars
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
um but if you if you have it with CPI
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
you could have it float and the formula
 
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
would do exactly what it needs to do and
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
not just give out 17.5 million
 
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
um on a regular basis it would give
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
whatever the numbers however the numbers
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
fall that's what it would give out
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
and going back a couple years we had
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacities varied at
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
approximately what 40 something million
 
00:58:25.319 --> 00:58:26.870 align:start position:0%
approximately what 40 something million
dollars

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
um explain how that's arrived at and
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
maybe that's where we've got to start
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
entering in a little bit of what uh
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
represented fellas has here
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
yeah so for those news to the committee
 
00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:38.579 align:start position:0%
the way in talking about different ways
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
to measure poverty a lot of the
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
conversations for the past five years
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
we've had about Equity there's a lot of
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
different ways to talk about Equity but
 
00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:47.579 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work this committee has
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
done and study committees have done to
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
talk about measuring defining Equity
 
00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:54.059 align:start position:0%
it's a very it can be a very subjective
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
conversation and everyone has their own
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
opinion about Equity but the body of
 
00:58:59.210 --> 00:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
work done by this committee
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
F and R numbers is a way to talk about
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
Equity where the fnr students are that's
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
a way to talk about equity and then
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
property value is a way to talk about
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
equity and those are kind of the two
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
tools in the toolbox in which this
 
00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:12.059 align:start position:0%
committee and other committees have
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
talked about Equity
 
00:59:13.799 --> 00:59:14.510 align:start position:0%
talked about Equity
um

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
so the representative fellows uh bill
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's an fnr uh distribution in her in
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
her bill which focuses on just the fnr
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
and then there's something called fiscal
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid So Physical
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid is similar to
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant but it only
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
looks at property values and does not
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
look at fnr numbers so fiscal capacity
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
disparity a similar formula property
 
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
values over students not just F and R
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
students it's property values over
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
students so if you have a lot of
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
property value and not a lot of students
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to produce an equalized
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil and so that number
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
is going to be really high and so what
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
um what you might say is for each
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
student in that community in which they
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
can tax from their tax base they have a
 
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
larger tax base to pay for the education
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
of one student that's what equalized
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil is measuring
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
um and then if you have a lot of
 
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
if you have low popular if you have um
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh low property values and a lot of
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
students that's going to produce a
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
really low number for equalized
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil and then what that
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
would tell us was for each student in
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
that uh Community they have a low tax
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
base in which to raise revenue local
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
taxation Revenue to fund that student
 
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.230 align:start position:0%
taxation Revenue to fund that student
um

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes when you look at a spreadsheet
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
with 244 municipalities sometimes you
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
have a community that has kind of decent
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
property values but they have a lot of
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
students so these are some of the
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
Suburban towns sometimes you'll see them
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
show up if you look at if you look at
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative spreadsheet
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
um you'll probably see this in your own
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
research because they have a lot of
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
students they're tax base per pupil is
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
actually kind of small so that's how
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
when people analyze uh these bills
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
they're usually looking at fnr numbers
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
they're you looking at property value
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
um and they're then they're looking at
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
the Town by town and seeing okay what is
 
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
the distribution of tax base in the
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
state what is the distribution of
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
poverty in the state and that's
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
typically how these how these uh things
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
get analyzed
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
so this thing goes around and around
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
yeah representative yeah thanks thanks
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
Rick and um and you know you were you
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
were alluding earlier I think to the the
 
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
work we've done in in hospital 709 in
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
2019 and 2020 and um and I think Mark's
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
point about the um the property values
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
changing a lot obviously they've changed
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
a lot in the last uh in the last four
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
years because I was just looking at
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 709 and when we did that so
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
just a few years ago that um the the
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
equalized value per pupil range was 350
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
000 to a million dollars yes it was and
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
that covered the low end to about the
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
halfway point and now to cover that
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
range it's six hundred thousand dollars
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
to 1.6 million dollars and and I think
 
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
Mark's Mark's observation that look
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's not tied to a CPI that's New
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire property you know and and you
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
know real State Property Dynamics and
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
and it may be something that we're going
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
to have to revisit in statute to to you
 
01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
know update uh either increasing it or
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
decreasing it depending upon how how
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
property values uh fluctuate you know in
 
01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
order to provide some stabilization in
 
01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:39.299 align:start position:0%
the no I don't want to use the word
 
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
stabilization to provide some some
 
01:02:41.099 --> 01:02:43.130 align:start position:0%
stabilization to provide some some
predictability

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
predictability
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
um for uh for school districts
 
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.450 align:start position:0%
um for uh for school districts
yeah

01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh my my concern is I'm looking at a
 
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.770 align:start position:0%
uh my my concern is I'm looking at a
Lincoln

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
Lincoln
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
and Woodstock area and property values
 
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.030 align:start position:0%
and Woodstock area and property values
are

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
up there
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
income poverty is very existent and so
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
so any formula we have I think we're
 
01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
going to have to take in account both of
 
01:03:10.849 --> 01:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
those factors well in in 529 does that
 
01:03:10.859 --> 01:03:11.710 align:start position:0%
those factors well in in 529 does that
yeah

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
components yeah to it
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the the
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee here Urban
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
no thanks thank you thank you
 
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
just trying to pick your brain
 
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.010 align:start position:0%
just trying to pick your brain
um

01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
property values
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
my understanding it's based a lot on
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
what's recently sold
 
01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:38.660 align:start position:0%
Etc is and
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
if you're not selling your property
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
it it really has no effect on you what
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
what money you have to pay
 
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:49.460 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
property values have skyrocketed in my
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
town because there isn't a lot and a lot
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
of people want to live there
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
um which makes everybody's property
 
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
values real high but it doesn't make
 
01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
everybody's income real high people who
 
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
aren't selling their houses aren't
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
gaining and so the property values can
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
go up and go down but it doesn't change
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
how what people can pay is there a way
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
of kind of
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know trying to get a clue as to
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
what people can pay as opposed to
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
how desirable the property in their town
 
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
so in that getting like you're you're
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
talking at a more individualized basis
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
in a self-contained Community like a
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
town and homes within each Town
 
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
um as far as and then you're you're
 
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
linking it to income
 
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
um there's no program that that can be
 
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.750 align:start position:0%
um there's no program that that can be
done

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
targeted based on income through the
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula because we don't have
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
an income tax there's no there's no
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
metric there's nothing we can do for
 
01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:52.789 align:start position:0%
metric there's nothing we can do for
that

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
um as far as if property values go up in
 
01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
your community but your income is low
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
there's the uh
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
do you hardship the hardship program
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
that's um that's not really in this
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
committee um there's been bills to talk
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
about the hardship program about if you
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
are low income and you can qualify
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
um so there is a program within dra to
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
give property tax relief to low-income
 
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.650 align:start position:0%
give property tax relief to low-income
families

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
um that that's a separate program
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I think I think you make up
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
a good point is sometimes
 
01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.609 align:start position:0%
a good point is sometimes
um well

01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
you were talking about those that don't
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of income and the property
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
taxes go up it doesn't change anything
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
for them uh it doesn't provide any real
 
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
income for them it provides them wealth
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
but not income
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
um but yeah the way the way taxes work
 
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
is if if everyone's property value goes
 
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:35.579 align:start position:0%
up at the same time and the school
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
budget says um flat
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
um their tax rate goes down uh their tax
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
rate goes down so their net tax impact
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
is zero making all those assumptions so
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
that's kind of no harm no foul they're
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
paying the same amount of taxes they
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
were they just happen to have a lower
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
rate because all property values went up
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
um but yeah that's that's that's yeah
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing but as far as matching
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
talking about income the only vehicle
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
the state has to address to Target
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
income poor people who pay property
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.030 align:start position:0%
 
um yeah

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
so that works within a town but I'm
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
looking at across the state and we're
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
trying to distribute this money across
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
the state and how can we get an accurate
 
01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.270 align:start position:0%
the state and how can we get an accurate
picture

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
um across the state when
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
property values aren't necessarily going
 
01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:29.930 align:start position:0%
property values aren't necessarily going
up

01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
Universal you know consistently so you
 
01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:35.579 align:start position:0%
have areas where it's going up in areas
 
01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
where it's not so then it looks like oh
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
they're becoming richer when the reality
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
is they're the same as they were just
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
their property is more valuable but that
 
01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
you know so so we may be assuming that
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
say because or like he was talking about
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
because you have a ski area and you have
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
some people and the average you know the
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
property value is high but the people
 
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:03.740 align:start position:0%
who were there Maybe
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
that may not be affecting them at all
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
and so but we're looking at a state
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
thing so how do we take that into
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
consideration on the whole state level
 
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
when we have fluctuation in areas which
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
affects what that area is going to get
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
from the state but it doesn't actually
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
represent their actual ability to
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
provide an education yeah just two
 
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:29.339 align:start position:0%
points you're absolutely right wealth
 
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
and income are two different
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
measurements your wealth can go up your
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
income can stay flat you've got a
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
problem you've got an income problem
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
you've got a wealth you you're doing
 
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
well on the well side you're not doing
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
well on the income side those are
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
completely detached and when looking at
 
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per prop per pupil
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at wealth we're not
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
looking at income the only way to look
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
at income is to look at fnr and another
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
thing one another thing that comes up
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about like the town
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
of Lincoln
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
um uh uh when we analyze towns like
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
Lincoln there's other towns there's
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
community that have great property value
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
but they have working working poor
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
um they have a pretty a sizable amount
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
of blue working poor families that are
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
in there and that that shows up in the
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
data that's just not Lincoln that's a
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
multiple communities
 
01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.270 align:start position:0%
multiple communities
um

01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
but but yeah that's the income and
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
wealth are are two different metrics to
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
we had a physical capacity disparity
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
separate column in the formula years
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
back going back even when we put this
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
all together
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
but right now what do we have in there
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
besides the extraordinary needs Grant
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
and the relief Grant to account for this
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
this issue we've been talking about here
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
the poverty that exists
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire we do
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have fiscal capacity column
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
anymore do we no
 
01:08:59.809 --> 01:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
that's gone
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
and of the we used to have the cut off
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
at 48 and then fortunately we got rid of
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
all the waterfall effect for all those
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
different categories and it's just a
 
01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:11.900 align:start position:0%
slide right now and that's much better
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
however are we seeing more students in
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
the in school districts in the state
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
that are qualifying for that 48 percent
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
now as as result of free and reduced
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
I suspect no because the f r numbers are
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
down but I don't know for certain
 
01:09:31.259 --> 01:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
down but I don't know for certain
okay

01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
department right now on all this funding
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
not for this part for us now well let's
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
start having a conversation ourselves
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
because this is a work session yeah so
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
um don't go away Mark
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
so so this sort of along the lines of
 
01:09:58.570 --> 01:09:58.580 align:start position:0%
the um of the of the
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
capacity to to pay taxes and um and I
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
think taxpayer fairness and and uh and I
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's what house bill 529 is
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
going after is taxpayer fairness in
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
terms of the fiscal capacity disparity
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
Grant and student fairness
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
because it goes to the free and reduced
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
price lunch Grant which recognizes that
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
um that that school districts that have
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
a higher percentage of um of students
 
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
that come from low income backgrounds it
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
costs more to educate all of their
 
01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:32.209 align:start position:0%
costs more to educate all of their
students

01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:32.990 align:start position:0%
students
um

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
um because of that connection with uh
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
with poverty but just taking a couple of
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
data points I mean we've looked we've
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've we've mentioned Lincoln already
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
and so they've got a total all in I'm
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the dra21
 
01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:51.140 align:start position:0%
tax rates
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
total all in and Lincoln is 10.54 cents
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
per thousand
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
um in in Berlin it's
 
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
36.54 cents per thousand and in
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
Newcastle it's 4.78 cents per thousand
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
so um so when you just sort of you know
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
finger in the air when you do a 50 Cent
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
cut or 50 Cent reduction
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
um in let's say the Statewide education
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
property tax for you know across the
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
board Statewide how it hits those towns
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
um Lincoln would basically see a um a
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
five percent uh tax reduction Newcastle
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
would say a little about a 12 percent
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
tax reduction and Berlin would see more
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
like a one and a half percent uh tax
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
reduction so that's when you do a a
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
straight take 50 percent uh 50 cents out
 
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
of the out of the out of the swept but
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know when we when we sort of zoom
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
out or zoom in actually to uh to the
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
individual families
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and I don't have this data at my
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
fingertips but I'm sure the dra would
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
would be able to help us with that if we
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
looked at the median home price in
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
Berlin and let's just finger in the air
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
call it three hundred thousand dollars
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
and the median home price in Newcastle
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
finger in the air 2 million two million
 
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.189 align:start position:0%
finger in the air 2 million two million
dollars

01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
um both those homeowners are paying
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
about ten thousand dollars a year in
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
local property taxes at that at those
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
the 4.78 rate in Newcastle in the 3654
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
rate in um in Berlin and and while we
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
don't as as Marx pointed out have data
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that suggests or that data that
 
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
that says that the homeowner in Berlin
 
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
has any different fiscal capacity or or
 
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
income than the homo owner in in
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
Newcastle I think Common Sense suggests
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
that the homeowner in Newcastle living
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
in a two million dollar home
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
probably has greater
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
resource access to resources than the
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
homeowner in Berlin uh living in a three
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar home I think
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of common I think
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's common sense
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
um because they're both and they're both
 
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
they're both essentially being assessed
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
um the same amount of total property
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
taxes about ten thousand dollars each I
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
know in Hopkinton I pay a lot more than
 
01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
than than both those uh examples and I
 
01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
think that's probably true in a lot of
 
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.570 align:start position:0%
think that's probably true in a lot of
other

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:31.580 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
communities around the state and uh and
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
and that's that's exactly what house
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
bill 529 is going after it certainly
 
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't level the um uh the
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
field but it provides some some property
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
tax relief in the in the towns as as
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
Mark has has pointed out that have the
 
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
have relatively low
 
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
um amounts of of taxable property and
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
relatively higher
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
um uh numbers of of students living in
 
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
those communities and um uh you know to
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
provide a little um a little you know
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
property tax relief to where it's where
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's needed most I think it's it's it's
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
hard to make a case that that the um
 
01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
that the that the homeowner in Newcastle
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
has uh has the same
 
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.370 align:start position:0%
has uh has the same
um

01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
access to resources as or that the
 
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
homeowner in Berlin has the same access
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
to resources as the homeowner in
 
01:14:34.739 --> 01:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
to resources as the homeowner in
Newcastle

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
that's just my comment
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
I I I just like to maybe retort a little
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
bit uh when we're when comparing a
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
Newcastle to a Berlin then you want to
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
look at okay let's look at the whole
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
scope of the taxes what is the municipal
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
tax rate in Berlin what is the municipal
 
01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
tax rate in Newcastle and why is the the
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
municipal tax rate in Berlin so very
 
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
very high
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
um what kind of services are they having
 
01:15:05.649 --> 01:15:05.659 align:start position:0%
and have they over built their services
 
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
so is in other words the total tax bill
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
you get is going to incorporate all
 
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.070 align:start position:0%
you get is going to incorporate all
those

01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
all those Services all those costs and
 
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
so are we seeing that the homeowner up
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
in Berlin is having to pay a whole lot
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
out of their little bit of money
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
um but are they is that a result of the
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
local Municipal select board or city
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
council making that decision and whereas
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
in Newcastle they may not
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
sure and and and I think that's I think
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's a really good point and you know
 
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.330 align:start position:0%
that's a really good point and you know
uh

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:43.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
certainly drilling down on on those two
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
examples because I think you're really
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
talking about you know ends of the um of
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
the spectrum here but also Manchester's
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
in this in this as well and uh I mean
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester's in the news every day for
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
all sorts of different you know uh
 
01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
matters and I'm not going to sort of
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
qualify what what what that is but uh
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
but you know the largest city largest
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
population in the state are obviously
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.149 align:start position:0%
going to have
um

01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:13.340 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know obligations and and
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that that go well
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
beyond what we have in Hopkinton in
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
terms of Public Safety and and and and
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
things like that but um but I think you
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
know if you're going to to your point
 
01:16:28.679 --> 01:16:29.990 align:start position:0%
know if you're going to to your point
Rick

01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
Rick
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
um you know when you when you're looking
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
at a a a a a a a flat
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
um one size fits-all tax rate cut versus
 
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
what 529 does which is provides a
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
graduated you know slope you know of of
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:54.380 align:start position:0%
um you know a 50 cut off the swept
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
basically reduces the the new castles of
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
property owners living in the two
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
million dollar home reduces their ten
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar uh tax bill to eight
 
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and and in Berlin
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
living in the 300 000 home reduces their
 
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar tax bill to nine
 
01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
thousand nine hundred
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
um ninety five dollars probably or nine
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
thousand nine hundred dollars certainly
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
not the same level of uh level of impact
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and and I think
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know again to your point Rick
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
um the the the
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
um the services that are probably being
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
provided in Berlin aren't being provided
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
because they're they're they're cup
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
overflow with with money but because
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
they need to do that but in the in the
 
01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:51.020 align:start position:0%
in the flat tax cut World Berlin
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
receives almost nothing and Newcastle
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
who pre and they probably don't need to
 
01:17:56.219 --> 01:17:57.350 align:start position:0%
who pre and they probably don't need to
provide

01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
many services you know in Newcastle
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
right receives a 2000 the average
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
homeowner receives a two thousand dollar
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars off their ten
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar you know tax bill so so
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's exactly what
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I think is so you
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
know aptly going after here with the
 
01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.770 align:start position:0%
know aptly going after here with the
graduated

01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
graduated
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
um um approach just like what what you
 
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
and I worked on together four years ago
 
01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.550 align:start position:0%
and I worked on together four years ago
representative

01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah to follow on what you were saying
 
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
and remembering back when we used to
 
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
have what were called donor towns and
 
01:18:34.689 --> 01:18:34.699 align:start position:0%
receiver Tower whatever
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
I remember
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
our town
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
um which at the time had pretty good
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
property values we are very fiscally
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
conservative we our town hall is still
 
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
our Old Town Hall I mean it's you know
 
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
probably pushing 200 years old and
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
and we have a huge population that we're
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
servicing and there'd be other towns
 
01:19:03.169 --> 01:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
that have these big fancy buildings that
 
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
they built
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
and so their expenses are high their
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
expenses are higher because the local
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
people chose to spend the money on those
 
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
things and the same thing goes with the
 
01:19:17.649 --> 01:19:17.659 align:start position:0%
schools because the local
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
property owners are voting on what they
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
are spending their money on we can see
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
great disparity and yet we're just
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
looking at oh this property in this town
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
so they can pay this much money and they
 
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
can't and I remember there were people
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
in my town one of the things I heard all
 
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
the time is why should we be paying for
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
your fancy Taj Mahal fire department
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
when we were at the time still in our
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
original but we have rebuilt the fire
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
department but
 
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
I mean we rebuilt the police the fire
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the town hall is still the same old
 
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
building in the center of town because
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
we don't choose to spend the money and
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
so once you start it's just something to
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
think about is that how much towns have
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
how much the schools cost how much their
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
taxes are how much things also is a
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
local decision and it's not just oh they
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
have or they don't have
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's a local decision what they want to
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
spend their money on and we might have
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
and choose to live frugally and they
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
might not have and choose not to live
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
frugally and and you have to
 
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.729 align:start position:0%
frugally and and you have to
it's

01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
anyway it's just something to go into
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
the conversation that I want to throw
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
out there that you have to look at that
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
too that's all
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I guess first of all I wanted to say
 
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.610 align:start position:0%
um I guess first of all I wanted to say
that

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
it sets up a vicious cycle
 
01:20:48.970 --> 01:20:48.980 align:start position:0%
uh with these towns like Berlin
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester Newport that the more they
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
the more they struggle
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
with their with their tax rate the more
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
or their taxes and their schools need
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
more services the town needs more
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
services versus a town that's wealthy
 
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
that also is maybe a tourist area
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but wealth brings in wealth more
 
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
people want to move to a town if they
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
have means where the school is good and
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
where the town services are good
 
01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
um and shy away from
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
the towns that don't and so do the
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
businesses the businesses want to go to
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
towns that are doing well versus so it's
 
01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's a vicious cycle so it's it's very
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
disruptive through the whole thing but I
 
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
don't think that's what we're talking
 
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
about in 590.
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
um I think we're talking about
 
01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
um you know disparity Aid and and these
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
other factors are relevant they we see
 
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
them all the time but I don't think that
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
this is what we're really
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
we've gone off the rails a little bit
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
well we've gone up there rails a little
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
bit but in all the bills which were
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
requesting a financial note uh in terms
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
of even like School building Aid the
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
physical capacity is built medium family
 
01:22:06.649 --> 01:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
income is built into that formula
 
01:22:06.659 --> 01:22:08.030 align:start position:0%
income is built into that formula
and

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
the poor Community is just going to end
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
up with older and older buildings that
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be renovated unless they
 
01:22:18.729 --> 01:22:18.739 align:start position:0%
can hook into some state aid
 
01:22:18.739 --> 01:22:20.330 align:start position:0%
can hook into some state aid
and

01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't see that any resolution
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
of that coming forward because that
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
formula is is as two sides of the
 
01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:32.219 align:start position:0%
equation there in terms of where the you
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
know what we based up receiving the
 
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
money on
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so I think this issue of f r and
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
poverty and how we can you know help the
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
districts which are in despair we need
 
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
to figure that one out and we need to do
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
it quickly
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
represent Milo
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair you know I I don't
 
01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:55.580 align:start position:0%
know about the rest of the committee but
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
I rely on frankly those who understand
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
numbers better than I do
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
is that these numbers are what drives
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
equal educational opportunity
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
that those children that are in low uh
 
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
poverty wealth towns
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
need to be able to have the same kind of
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities as those that
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
are in wealthy towns
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
and so as we begin to look at these uh
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
various formulas Etc
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's the screen that I look at
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
is that how can children in Newcastle
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
and in Berlin
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
have similar opportunities here for a a
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
quality education
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
and we can get into the discussion about
 
01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:53.219 align:start position:0%
well money doesn't count you talk to
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
Korean cascadden about whether or not
 
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
money counts in Berlin
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
and when she has to close the school
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
because she doesn't have the kind of
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
money that can keep those schools open
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's my concern and I think what of
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
529 and
 
01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.890 align:start position:0%
529 and
um

01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:11.750 align:start position:0%
um
for

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah 435 is trying to address that
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
sense of parity
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
so that children do have an opportunity
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
an equal opportunity across the state
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
and so as I'm that is the screen that
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at and I I will I will be
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
very honest with you all I don't
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
understand all the numbers maybe you do
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
others understand that and David and I
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
worked on this and we we've kind of said
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
I deal with all the policy question
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
about what's fair and he says well
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
here's here's a here's here's a funding
 
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
and formulas that drive that fairness
 
01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.550 align:start position:0%
and formulas that drive that fairness
and

01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
um I know Mark has been working on this
 
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
thing too and trying to provide a fair
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity for kids across the state
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
and that to me is what what's the
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
Bedrock of these two bills is how do we
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
provide fairness and I know Rick has
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
worked with us on on trying to deal with
 
01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
that too and so um I just Mr chair I
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
just want to say kids haven't been
 
01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned yet in this conversation
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern is for this where
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
the students are in this conversation
 
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:17.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
supports the values that representative
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
Myler just spoke about the kids
 
01:25:39.729 --> 01:25:39.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
2120 is local education 1501 is
 
01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:45.470 align:start position:0%
2120 is local education 1501 is
municipal

01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
in their school budget proposed for the
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
coming year
 
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
they took out
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
increased funding to improve and expand
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
the CTE programs at Sugar River
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
vocational schools
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
that employers and Industry in that
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
municipality and the surrounding towns
 
01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
that would benefit employment throughout
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
the area
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
Linda's comment about wealth brings in
 
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
wealth well poverty brings in poverty if
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
you can't create the training to create
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
the employees then you don't have
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
thriving business and the reason they
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
took those CTE programs out of the
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
budget is they're trying to preserve
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
a new teacher contract that's getting
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
voted on separately
 
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
that is structured to try hard to
 
01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
improve teacher retention
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
in a district that has a long history
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
of employing
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
young inexperienced teachers and they
 
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
get experience in Claremont and then
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
they leave to get ten to twenty thousand
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
dollars more per year
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
almost anywhere else
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
so to me it's such a picture of what we
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
need to be addressing
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
and 529 I think really tries to do that
 
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect but it's a good step in
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
the right direction
 
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you just another thing one of the
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
things that this school funding
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
commission focused on
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this two years ago
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
versus my kid
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
and if in fact we are concerned about
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
developing a Workforce
 
01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
within this state
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
where businesses will come in as
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
following up with representative Damon's
 
01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:46.729 align:start position:0%
following up with representative Damon's
comment

01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
we need to be concerned about that if
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm only concerned about my kids in
 
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.770 align:start position:0%
I'm only concerned about my kids in
Hopkinton

01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:53.780 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton
 
01:27:56.890 --> 01:27:56.900 align:start position:0%
it doesn't help the general population
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
to create a Workforce
 
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
so you take the you take the students
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
better in Claremont
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
those are just as important
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
as students in Rye
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
that have greater opportunity both from
 
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
their own family situation as well as
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
those who may not have the same kind of
 
01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
situations in Claremont
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
and so for me
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
that Workforce across the state is
 
01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:31.139 align:start position:0%
fundamental to funding schools
 
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
and that's why our report here that we
 
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
that we miss you it's called our schools
 
01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
our kids
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
from that standpoint of trying to create
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
a a universe where children have an
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
equal educational opportunity and that's
 
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
why my focus is on our kids and not just
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
my children that are in Hopkinton
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
represent parenail
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
that report looks really interesting I'm
 
01:28:59.810 --> 01:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a way we can
 
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
receive a copy of that
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we we should have extra copies
 
01:29:07.629 --> 01:29:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
a box on it all you have to do is read
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot of sections you need
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
to read in there
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
um you know there's some that I agreed
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
with and some I didn't agree with I was
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
on that at that study
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
um but my concern I do have a similar
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
concern as representative Miler just
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
spoke to
 
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
um it's hard for me to see things which
 
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
are going on the CTE Center in Salem in
 
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.510 align:start position:0%
are going on the CTE Center in Salem in
Hudson

01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hudson
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
down other places and then I I see the
 
01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:44.900 align:start position:0%
center that the kids from my town go to
 
01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
April which happens to be in Vermont and
 
01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
it's a CT Senate just does not have the
 
01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.830 align:start position:0%
it's a CT Senate just does not have the
offerings

01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
offerings
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
that other Centers do have yet it's it's
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
run by good people
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
it it just there is a difference in
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
obeyability of programs and I see some
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
other communities that are donor towns
 
01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
right beside a town that's not a donor
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
town and the donor Town can't afford to
 
01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
even have AP taught in their schools uh
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
whereas this this dual District abutting
 
01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:20.219 align:start position:0%
it has that offerings because basically
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
the the wealth within the community
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
and that's a real picture throughout
 
01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
and and I I agree with a lot that's in
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
that report I didn't re regard support
 
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
part of the basic understandings of
 
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
where the dollars came from to do what
 
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
that report was trying to do
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
but I I I I see the need that we need to
 
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
address this and if we can help out with
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
this fiscal disparity and having that
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
sliding formula we developed in 709 and
 
01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
something similar to that
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to start directing
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
the money to where it really is going to
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
have to get the biggest bang for the
 
01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
buck and um and not negating what might
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
happen in your town representative
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
cardelli which is a town which has that
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
that wealth within it
 
01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:08.870 align:start position:0%
that wealth within it
um

01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
but uh if we're going to want all this
 
01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
Workforce that we need in the state
 
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to think how we're
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to achieve it representative
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
Cornell you know you want to rebut that
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh to point out that we
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
have some properties yeah with wealth we
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
have many
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
um and I can show you the run-down
 
01:31:33.169 --> 01:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
trailers that do not
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
um you know that's something to keep in
 
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
mind also we and we have a
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
um right at the average if not above
 
01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
number of free and reduced students
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
yeah and and likewise with Sunapee which
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
I live in
 
01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
I live in
um

01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
that I was talking to superintendent the
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
free and reduced has gone up
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
tremendously uh since Coven in Sunapee
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
well the same thing in Bridgewater if
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
you're on the lake there
 
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
then you get off the lake on the other
 
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
side of the highway you you see the
 
01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:04.550 align:start position:0%
side of the highway you you see the
opposite

01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
opposite
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
so it's it's all over the state reps and
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
Lexus had her head over there for a
 
01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.910 align:start position:0%
Lexus had her head over there for a
while

01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
um thank you I wanted to ask rep Miller
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
you said that we value all children and
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're all important and just because
 
01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
they live in this town as opposed to
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
that town doesn't make them any more or
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
less valuable and I'm wondering if you
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
also believe that a child just because a
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
public school doesn't work out well for
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
them and they need to go to
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
some other low facility design way of
 
01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
doing education in order to work out do
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
they mean less or should we also be
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're funding children
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to school buildings that's
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
sliding in a whole different decision
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
but that's a bill but those are bills
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
before but that's going into a different
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
discussion than the the the opposite
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
side whether I I'm there or not would
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
say well you better start funding the
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
public school more so they can compete
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
with what the the receiving school is
 
01:33:07.209 --> 01:33:07.219 align:start position:0%
freezing that's the argument I believe
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
on the other side there's another
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
argument too so
 
01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
argument too so
um

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah one of the things we can
 
01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
respond to that when we come to that
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
bill comes before us the other issue
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
that that really hasn't been talked
 
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
about much this morning and that is the
 
01:33:27.169 --> 01:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
issue of property tax relief
 
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh and one of the things that the report
 
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see in there does talk about the
 
01:33:34.729 --> 01:33:34.739 align:start position:0%
need for the state to really to to begin
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
to modify uh property tax relief for uh
 
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
low-income families uh when we looked at
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
the cert when we did our survey that
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
summer you recall Rick one of the things
 
01:33:48.169 --> 01:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
we discovered is that it hadn't been
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
changed in 20 years
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so the the as the property values
 
01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
have gone up and the property tax relief
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
has stayed the same
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
it wasn't much incentive for somebody to
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
go in and even provide the forms for Dra
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
to get that relief and one of the things
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about here is
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
how do you also provide at the same time
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with with these formulas
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
how do you then deal with the issue of
 
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
Greater property tax relief for people
 
01:34:21.649 --> 01:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
in your town Glenn that can that can't
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
afford that can get some relief and I
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
think that's another very important part
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
of this whole as you look at the whole
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
scheme here
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
we talked about that also you know the
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
veterans get a deduct of what 500 off
 
01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
their bill
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
where if you're elderly it doesn't Cop
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
come off your bill it comes off of the
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
assessment on your property
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
and and so two different things there
 
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
that that we did consider on that
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
Commission on that committee
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.930 --> 01:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
I just wanna
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
no then please correct me if I don't
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
have this right
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
balancing features of 529
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
or communities like Sunapee and
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's community
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
if you have a high incidence of pre and
 
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
you will get
 
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
that part of additional Aid regardless
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
of your property values so you could
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
have high property values and not get
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
that part of the aid but it somewhat
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
balances out by providing Aid in two
 
01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
am I making sense well you know if I can
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
if I can address that real quick you
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
know it's not about balancing out it's
 
01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
about yeah it's about recognizing two
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
different things
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
um it's about recognizing
 
01:35:59.810 --> 01:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
um uh taxpayer fairness and uh and
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
providing some relief where there's the
 
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
the least availability of Financial
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
Resources into a community
 
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
um as both the blanket relief it directs
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
it to where the re where the resources
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
are lacking so that's the fiscal
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid part and then
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
there's the free and reduced price lunch
 
01:36:20.639 --> 01:36:22.010 align:start position:0%
there's the free and reduced price lunch
Grant

01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
um which recognizes the fact that
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
whether you whether whether you're the
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District or the um or
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you know or the Hopkins school
 
01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
district or or the governor Wentworth
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
School District that that when you've
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
got higher percentages of students that
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
come from low income basketball
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
backgrounds your cost of education for
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
everybody increases and so so it's it's
 
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
providing relief both in a way that's
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
fair for students
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
through that in a way that's fair for
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and that's why the two the two
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
the two you know portions of this and um
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
and and and then I think what uh what
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
what Mel brought up with respect to a
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
directed low and moderate income
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program there have
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
been some changes to incremental changes
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
to that over the last I think two
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
sessions uh it's been incremental
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
there's another bill House Bill 569
 
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
which was heard in Ways and Means
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
yesterday I haven't caught up on it
 
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
since then but but uh but that actually
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
um revamps the low and moderate uh
 
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program and um and
 
01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that I think is absolutely specific
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
to what representative cordelli was
 
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
saying that that not everybody lives in
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
in Wolfeboro and Tuftonboro are are rich
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
and that's true at every you know you
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
know every every place around the state
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
and um and and that's why that that
 
01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
program is so important and it's really
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
the the uh you know an important you
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
know the third the third rung on this on
 
01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:06.179 align:start position:0%
this stool of of providing um you know
 
01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Equity student equity and and
 
01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
targeted property directed property tax
 
01:38:11.699 --> 01:38:13.669 align:start position:0%
targeted property directed property tax
relief

01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
relief
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
can we just take a break from this for a
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
sec because we have several other bills
 
01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I got Mark here in front of us and
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh Mark we were discussing about the how
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
special education differentiated Aid
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
would work with this and I see Brian's
 
01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
back there and he's been doing a little
 
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
work and we're running out of time here
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
for this work session
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so could you please explain you know
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
what kind of percentages you're looking
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
at in terms of which qualify for various
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
categories of
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
of increased differentiated Aid
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
this this will be related to I think the
 
01:38:48.729 --> 01:38:48.739 align:start position:0%
last bill there 540.
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
Brian might have to run some run some
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
formulas real quick but um he's been
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
playing around with some data uh it's
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
based on a 2021 snapshot of the
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
different type of IEPs or sped programs
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
being offered in this in in the district
 
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
public schools and he's been trying to
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
bring that data up to Modern data
 
01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:12.179 align:start position:0%
um so it's been it's been a little bit
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
of uh workarounds with the data to get
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
it to something that we can provide you
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
with some decent information but Brian
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
will run through some of those numbers
 
01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:21.380 align:start position:0%
that he's been analyzing
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my name is bryony in
 
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Office of school
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
of Finance so like Mark mentioned we
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
took a 2021 snapshot so school year 2022
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
of special education students
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
um and we scaled that to
 
01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.209 align:start position:0%
um and we scaled that to
um

01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
the actual ADM for that school year so
 
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's a little inflated a little bit just
 
01:39:45.649 --> 01:39:45.659 align:start position:0%
to compare as much as we can Apples to
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
Apples uh so this bill would categorize
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
its abilities in categories a through C
 
01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
found that with that
 
01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:56.149 align:start position:0%
found that with that
um

01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:59.689 --> 01:39:59.699 align:start position:0%
scaled number it would be about 22 000
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
almost 23 000 members within uh
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
disability category a
 
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
um about seven thousand in category B
 
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
and about 600 in category C so a
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
membership of about thirty thousand uh
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
which is comparable to school year 2022
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
just to kind of compare apples to apples
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
as best we can
 
01:40:20.689 --> 01:40:20.699 align:start position:0%
that total Aid would come to would have
 
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
come to uh 83 million 83.7 million and
 
01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:27.530 align:start position:0%
come to uh 83 million 83.7 million and
under

01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
what was current law uh that was and
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
that would bring the total funding to
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
982 million
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
while the under that current law would
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
have been 962 million so about a little
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
under 20 million dollar increase uh
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
utilizing the categorized methodology
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
for especially so you're basically
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
saying it would take it up to about 83.7
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
from 60
 
01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
from 60
three

01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes yeah that sounds right yep okay
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
so it's an increase of 20 million
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
um so going back then for folks here in
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
the committee we we had approximately
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
rounding off 30 000 special education
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
students in the state with IEPs
 
01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
and category a was for students which
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
are receiving support for less than 80
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
percent of the time and that is
 
01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
according to the data that I had from
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
doe earlier was at 26.8 000 they're
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
saying 23 000 right there now and
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
category B would be for those that are
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
more than 80 percent uh which we had
 
01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
identified initially at 2.7 000 now it's
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
seven thousand and the last category
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
which is catastrophic Aid residential
 
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
placement Hospital succession would be
 
01:41:54.649 --> 01:41:54.659 align:start position:0%
600 we had approximately 760 758
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
something like that 600 600 yeah so okay
 
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
that clarifies that so we're looking now
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
rather than an increase of 10 million
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
dollars we're looking at an increase
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
around 20 million dollars that's our
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
best estimate without having actual
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
numbers it's hard that's basically what
 
01:42:11.649 --> 01:42:11.659 align:start position:0%
we've tried to do our best to scale and
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
assign I know students with the Special
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
Education data those categories so
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's our best estimate at this time
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll work with if this bill ends
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
up over in finance we'll work to
 
01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:23.699 align:start position:0%
fine-tune that number and give an
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
official uh analysis but representative
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
lad's analysis was using all their data
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
and the data shipped a little bit to
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
move from category a to the uh more
 
01:42:34.609 --> 01:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
expensive categories so it's going to be
 
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
higher than the estimate representative
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
Vlad had but we will fine tune that
 
01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
number with finance and get them a more
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
accurate number as the session
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
progresses if this bill progresses
 
01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:44.810 align:start position:0%
progresses if this bill progresses
foreign

01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
any further questions on that
 
01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
oh representative thanks very much Rick
 
01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.189 align:start position:0%
oh representative thanks very much Rick
so

01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:52.199 --> 01:42:52.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
so and this is a question to you Rick so
 
01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
we we're also looking at uh House Bill
 
01:43:01.850 --> 01:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
577 which is the category special
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
education categorical Aid and that 1.5
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
times 3.3.5 times and um and how does
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
um move along with with with that
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
540 has been designed as as part of
 
01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:25.810 align:start position:0%
540 has been designed as as part of
adequacy

01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:25.820 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
whereas the catastrophic Aid is not or
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
special education Aid is not adequacy
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
what 540 that's appropriation it
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
basically says yes uh we are going to
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
wait these categories and we know the
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
weight that we're going to give to those
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
that are home in the hospital or
 
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
residential placement is going to have
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
to be more and that should be in
 
01:43:52.129 --> 01:43:52.139 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid well and across the
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
board available to every school district
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
that has a youngster in that category
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
whereas the catastrophic Aid is the the
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
I guess the more of the elephant in the
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
room now
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
um that we're going to have to decide
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
how do we tweak that if we're going to
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
tweak it do we go from
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
three and a half times before things
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
start clicking in down to one and a half
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
then we're we're the other that the
 
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
difference is going to have to be paid
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
for somewhere and it involves probably
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
more kids in that equation as well
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
and or do we address as represent
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
Belcher said do we start addressing the
 
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
upper portions of that and tweaking the
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
20 80 percent category and or it will
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
shrink down 100 category to less than
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know then we not 10 times maybe
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
eight times or six times I I think we
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
have to address that whole formula
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
seeing that this is a huge huge problem
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
in the state right now especially that
 
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
this shows up and it's based on the
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
previous year and you don't have the
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
money in the pot
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
um where do you get it
 
01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.030 align:start position:0%
um where do you get it
so

01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
I I I can't answer that anymore yeah
 
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah but I think it would be
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
so valuable to to you know see
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
you know how these how these two things
 
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
sort of meld you know together uh
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
because obviously they're you know one
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
of them's out of see one of them's
 
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
agreeing so they're they're they're
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're sort of two
 
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
different species here but um but
 
01:45:25.129 --> 01:45:25.139 align:start position:0%
they're both they're both going after a
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
a similar
 
01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:27.970 align:start position:0%
a similar
a

01:45:27.970 --> 01:45:27.980 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:30.659 align:start position:0%
related problem
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's a really a policy issue too
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
so I as a school district going to have
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
to find that dollar and I'm going to
 
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
look in my other operational capacity
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
areas in my budget to try to find the
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
dollars to support this extraordinary
 
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
need and then I'll call it an
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
extraordinary I I didn't anticipate it
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
it just moved into town so I got to pay
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
for this so I'm gonna have to subtract
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
from the PE program or something else to
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
make that or else I'm going to have to
 
01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
have appropriate more time money and the
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
town's not going like that
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
um to incur more debt they're not like
 
01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.229 align:start position:0%
um to incur more debt they're not like
that

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:09.239 --> 01:46:10.390 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair would you would you define
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
for the committee the difference between
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
how much time we have here we have well
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
I mean the adequacy you have the base
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy the base amount that every
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
student in the state receives
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
and then you have these four areas in
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
differentiated a because we recognize
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
there are students in this first area
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
that have these special needs be it
 
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
English language learner be it
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
Remediation in a third grade reading
 
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
that if you don't qualify for all or
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
free and reduced or special education
 
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
qualifying that is part of what we have
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
done in reaction to Claremont one two
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
and a million and and and Londonderry
 
01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's all there that's what we have to do
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
for every child in the state
 
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
then we have the grant programs on top
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
of that which we've been talking about
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
earlier today or where we try to help
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
those with the physical capacity
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid and extraordinary needs
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
Grant and the relief Grant that's on top
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
of though and that's nothing that's part
 
01:47:31.810 --> 01:47:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh so the difference between our grant
 
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
programs if they're all done on a
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement basement adequacy kind of
 
01:47:39.169 --> 01:47:39.179 align:start position:0%
is a reimbursement basement and since
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
that you provided student data from the
 
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
year before we pay you based on that
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
data and based on a formula
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
um in the next year but with the with
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
our federal programming and grants with
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
our sped uh Aid it's really a one-to-one
 
01:47:54.890 --> 01:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
you paid a particular cost you are
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
showing evidence that you paid that
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
particular cost and you're receiving
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
money to match that particular cost and
 
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
that Grant is restricted to compensate
 
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
you for that very specific cost that you
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
provided evidence to with adequacy it's
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
data and then data runs through the
 
01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:09.659 align:start position:0%
formula and it delivers what it delivers
 
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
based on the formula and based on the
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
data and it's so but adequacy is also
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
unrestricted um so it's not designed to
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
reimburse for a specific cost it's
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
designed to kind of underwrite the
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
funding of your community using State
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and it has a constitutional
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
connection where sped Aid doesn't have
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.679 --> 01:48:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
further

01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
questions today we're going to call it
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
quits here because we have some other
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
things coming up here
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
so um if if a school doesn't have the
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
funding to to match then they don't get
 
01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement in these grants
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
if they don't provide the service which
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
is potentially other legal problems they
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
could have but if they don't provide the
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
service uh
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
then then they're not going to get
 
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
reimbursed if they don't have the
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
funding that is a cash flow
 
01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
appropriation challenge that they're
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to run into
 
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
um and and how they do that they could
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
run a deficit in their general fund and
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
then reimburse their General if they
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
have the cash to run a deficit if they
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
can afford it to run a deficit and not
 
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
you know run not start skipping their
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
vendors but if they can run a deficit in
 
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.219 align:start position:0%
communities can run a deficit if they
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
have the cash to do so they could
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
compensate their general fund
 
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
retroactively using State money I don't
 
01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:30.179 align:start position:0%
know how districts do it I can get it
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
can get very complicated if they don't
 
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
have money uh they probably get a little
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
creative hopefully it all stays legal
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
um but yeah uh that's a particular
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
challenge but they can they can work
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
around that and use existing Authority
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
and laws to to figure that out but yeah
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not easy
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much I really
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%

and uh we're gonna have to we've got a
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
lot of policy decisions ahead of us here
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
and we're going to start making some of
 
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
those when we start executing these
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%

gonna have to have a discussion
 
01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves but I think we need to take a
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
little short break here uh folks been
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%

02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%

02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
that party then because
 
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen on this side of
 
02:06:54.010 --> 02:06:54.020 align:start position:0%
the coin
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
we do not want to raise our property tax
 
02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:02.169 align:start position:0%
we do not want to raise our property tax
okay

02:07:02.169 --> 02:07:02.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:04.550 align:start position:0%
and and
um

02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner if you can find that
 
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:17.089 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner if you can find that
Amendment

02:07:17.089 --> 02:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.099 --> 03:22:27.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:22:27.670 --> 03:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
about which number we use
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
whether we go with the number for the
 
03:22:36.530 --> 03:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
national eating disorder
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
which is a number not the same as 988
 
03:22:42.710 --> 03:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to have this discussion
 
03:22:45.230 --> 03:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
just Orient around that particular which
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
number is used
 
03:22:48.410 --> 03:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
are not used
 
03:22:50.929 --> 03:22:50.939 align:start position:0%
and so we can just have a little bit of
 
03:22:52.969 --> 03:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
a discussion here and then go on and and
 
03:22:54.530 --> 03:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
address the bill
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli
 
03:22:59.450 --> 03:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues I think that was
 
03:23:04.370 --> 03:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
raised during the hearing I followed up
 
03:23:08.590 --> 03:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
and on and got the information from
 
03:23:12.229 --> 03:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
their website as to availability of the
 
03:23:15.889 --> 03:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
hotline online chat is available Monday
 
03:23:18.530 --> 03:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
through Thursday nine to nine and Friday
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
nine to five
 
03:23:23.210 --> 03:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
for telephone calls at their 800 number
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's Monday through Thursday 11 A.M to 9
 
03:23:31.929 --> 03:23:31.939 align:start position:0%
p.m and Friday 11 A.M to 5 p.m and text
 
03:23:34.550 --> 03:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
it is available Monday through Thursday
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
3 P.M to 6 p.m and Friday 1 pm to 5 p.m
 
03:23:42.889 --> 03:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
um I think that is an issue that needs
 
03:23:44.809 --> 03:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
to be considered
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
first of all I'd like to say that I
 
03:23:51.290 --> 03:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
don't think this is an either or
 
03:23:53.210 --> 03:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh issue
 
03:23:56.090 --> 03:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
um that you can have the the crisis
 
03:23:58.309 --> 03:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
hotline number and the Eating Disorders
 
03:24:01.250 --> 03:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
number uh that's my first point and my
 
03:24:04.370 --> 03:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
second point is that Eating Disorders
 
03:24:06.830 --> 03:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
have a special
 
03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:08.090 align:start position:0%
have a special
um

03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:11.570 --> 03:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
special kind of Crisis point to it that
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
and the special language to it and
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's quite different than
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
um suicide or the other crisis that may
 
03:24:22.729 --> 03:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
come into the 988 number
 
03:24:26.210 --> 03:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
um and the Eating Disorders hotline I
 
03:24:29.090 --> 03:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
think is a is a group that's that's
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
been started and is in
 
03:24:32.640 --> 03:24:33.410 align:start position:0%
been started and is in
um

03:24:33.410 --> 03:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:37.250 --> 03:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
in a period of actually growing because
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
the the crisis is growing along with
 
03:24:43.790 --> 03:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
um covid and the increase in mental
 
03:24:45.950 --> 03:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
health issues but this is a very
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
specific mental health issue with a very
 
03:24:53.570 --> 03:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
specific need and like I said this isn't
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
a choice of one or the other both of
 
03:24:59.750 --> 03:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
them could be included thank you
 
03:25:03.050 --> 03:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
I have two questions which hopefully
 
03:25:07.370 --> 03:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
somebody can answer
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
um one is the 98 is 988
 
03:25:12.840 --> 03:25:14.990 align:start position:0%
um one is the 98 is 988
um

03:25:14.990 --> 03:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:18.110 --> 03:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
do they do they if you call with a house
 
03:25:20.929 --> 03:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
eating disorder do they then transmute
 
03:25:23.690 --> 03:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
for you to one of those people who would
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
have the proper language
 
03:25:28.250 --> 03:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
Etc and the other question is
 
03:25:30.769 --> 03:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
if you're a kid who finally got the
 
03:25:30.779 --> 03:25:31.729 align:start position:0%
if you're a kid who finally got the
nerve

03:25:31.729 --> 03:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
nerve
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
to call and there's no answer on the
 
03:25:37.190 --> 03:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
other end
 
03:25:38.990 --> 03:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
is that going to make things better or
 
03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:45.010 align:start position:0%
is that going to make things better or
worse

03:25:45.010 --> 03:25:45.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:47.809 --> 03:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
that's this is for the whole committees
 
03:25:49.389 --> 03:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
people can respond to that
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you it's my understanding 988
 
03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
because it expanded from
 
03:25:58.490 --> 03:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
um a suicide hotline to a mental health
 
03:26:02.090 --> 03:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
one is equipped to refer you to whatever
 
03:26:05.090 --> 03:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
you need both geographically and by
 
03:26:05.100 --> 03:26:07.610 align:start position:0%
you need both geographically and by
subject

03:26:07.610 --> 03:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
subject
 
03:26:07.620 --> 03:26:09.370 align:start position:0%
subject
foreign

03:26:09.370 --> 03:26:09.380 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
that you say it's an eating disorder
 
03:26:13.790 --> 03:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
that this would be the number they would
 
03:26:15.650 --> 03:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
put you to of course if that would be a
 
03:26:16.849 --> 03:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
time that that number would be
 
03:26:16.859 --> 03:26:19.130 align:start position:0%
time that that number would be
operational

03:26:19.130 --> 03:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
operational
 
03:26:19.140 --> 03:26:20.929 align:start position:0%
operational
representative

03:26:20.929 --> 03:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:26:24.349 --> 03:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
the thing the channel I I understand uh
 
03:26:27.710 --> 03:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
Governor Lucas's concern of the double
 
03:26:29.690 --> 03:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
number in a youngster or a student or a
 
03:26:31.969 --> 03:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
young adult that anyway actually who
 
03:26:35.330 --> 03:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
just uh I get the nerve up to make the
 
03:26:38.030 --> 03:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
call but again if you get the nerve up
 
03:26:40.190 --> 03:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
you can be able to that's a stop in the
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
right direction uh and the time frame is
 
03:26:44.630 --> 03:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
as representative cordelli said and
 
03:26:47.150 --> 03:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
represent wrong mentioned before uh is
 
03:26:49.670 --> 03:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
limited but it's expanding
 
03:26:51.650 --> 03:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
um so to have both numbers on the card I
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
think is is much more reasonable for a
 
03:26:59.809 --> 03:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
student uh than it is for for uh just
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
having one it automatically getting the
 
03:27:03.769 --> 03:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
wrong one so at least you have a default
 
03:27:05.330 --> 03:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
piece there if you only put one you
 
03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
don't have a default
 
03:27:08.570 --> 03:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
um so I would be supporting putting both
 
03:27:11.210 --> 03:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
of them on remember for a lot of the
 
03:27:13.610 --> 03:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
people who use this we're going to use a
 
03:27:15.650 --> 03:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
line these are high school age students
 
03:27:18.530 --> 03:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
for the most part and body image is a
 
03:27:20.330 --> 03:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
huge thing it's happening now School
 
03:27:23.690 --> 03:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
issues all the time so clearly the the
 
03:27:25.370 --> 03:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
data is there that they need something
 
03:27:28.190 --> 03:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
and this is just one more tool in My
 
03:27:31.250 --> 03:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
Mind One More tool for our students in
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be able to have an
 
03:27:34.370 --> 03:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
access point that they didn't have
 
03:27:37.190 --> 03:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
before and I think it's uh I think we
 
03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
should should not negate the bill or
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
either or that's just me thank you
 
03:27:44.450 --> 03:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
I concur with the it's not either or I'd
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
like to remind the committee of the
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
discussion and the hearing
 
03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
about the usefulness of the info on the
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
ID card for people to simply be aware
 
03:28:00.050 --> 03:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
whether it's that person who calls or
 
03:28:02.990 --> 03:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
their friend that a helpline exists and
 
03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
that help is available
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
I think we can have reasonable
 
03:28:08.269 --> 03:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
confidence that the helpline hours will
 
03:28:10.130 --> 03:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
expand and also the hours overlap with
 
03:28:12.530 --> 03:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
the times when the people most in need
 
03:28:14.809 --> 03:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
are likely to use it late afternoon
 
03:28:18.349 --> 03:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
early evening are crisis times
 
03:28:20.750 --> 03:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:28:22.969 --> 03:28:22.979 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders are epidemic they're
 
03:28:25.130 --> 03:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
they're often invisible to people who
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't know but there's a huge need I
 
03:28:29.690 --> 03:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
think we'd be irresponsible not to pass
 
03:28:29.700 --> 03:28:31.309 align:start position:0%
think we'd be irresponsible not to pass
this

03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:28:34.130 --> 03:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
further represent Cornell
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I think 988 will refer you to
 
03:28:39.469 --> 03:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
the Eating Disorders hotline but that
 
03:28:41.389 --> 03:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve that they if they refer
 
03:28:43.190 --> 03:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
you they still won't be open except for
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
those hours and I don't think we should
 
03:28:49.490 --> 03:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
if we can keep people from calling at
 
03:28:52.610 --> 03:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
988 unless it's an immediate crisis we
 
03:28:55.130 --> 03:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
should because they're very busy and and
 
03:28:57.170 --> 03:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful not to be tying up
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
the line with calls that could be going
 
03:29:01.370 --> 03:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
03:29:04.729 --> 03:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
so and and they will refer to the to the
 
03:29:08.510 --> 03:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders hotline which won't be
 
03:29:12.349 --> 03:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:14.290 --> 03:29:14.300 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli
 
03:29:17.690 --> 03:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I remember several terms
 
03:29:21.410 --> 03:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
ago it might be three I had a bill
 
03:29:26.330 --> 03:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
um to require the poster be hung in each
 
03:29:30.530 --> 03:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
school for the sex abuse hotline
 
03:29:33.769 --> 03:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
um we spent an hour at least talking
 
03:29:37.250 --> 03:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
about the size and material for that
 
03:29:37.260 --> 03:29:39.650 align:start position:0%
about the size and material for that
poster

03:29:39.650 --> 03:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
poster
 
03:29:40.969 --> 03:29:40.979 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering
 
03:29:43.250 --> 03:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
should it be a hotline number on the ID
 
03:29:46.849 --> 03:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
card in sex abuse hotline what
 
03:29:50.210 --> 03:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
are we going to have maybe a priority
 
03:29:54.290 --> 03:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
list of hotlines to put on the ID cards
 
03:29:57.889 --> 03:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
for the representative uh dry and then
 
03:30:02.450 --> 03:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
03:30:05.630 --> 03:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon um we thought due
 
03:30:08.570 --> 03:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
respect especially to the the wonderful
 
03:30:11.450 --> 03:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
people we had come speak to this the
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
trend in emergency medicine is to move
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
to the simpler numbers that's why I went
 
03:30:20.330 --> 03:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
from 9-1-1 for emergency calls 988 for
 
03:30:22.809 --> 03:30:22.819 align:start position:0%
suicide and now expanded
 
03:30:26.210 --> 03:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
Suds and and just about anything else
 
03:30:28.389 --> 03:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
you will have
 
03:30:31.190 --> 03:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
professionals answering that call and
 
03:30:33.889 --> 03:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
they made it nationwide this year
 
03:30:36.050 --> 03:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
because they have the capacity to handle
 
03:30:38.809 --> 03:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
this it will be sent to the right place
 
03:30:41.150 --> 03:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
geographically and if this number is not
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
working at the national hotline then
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
they will have another place to send you
 
03:30:48.170 --> 03:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
if you go to the this hotline and it's
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
not working I don't know where it will
 
03:30:51.889 --> 03:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
send you I'm going to say that we would
 
03:30:54.889 --> 03:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
be bucking a trend that towards the
 
03:30:57.410 --> 03:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
simplification of universal numbers and
 
03:30:59.870 --> 03:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
National numbers if we stick all these
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
10 digit numbers on an ID card
 
03:31:04.670 --> 03:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
03:31:07.010 --> 03:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and the follow-up on
 
03:31:08.570 --> 03:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
the last two comments we've heard I just
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
want to also say that again we do need
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be cognizant of how much information
 
03:31:13.790 --> 03:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're putting on these cards I think if
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
I remember correctly the cdsd statistics
 
03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
from uh from one of the last uh surveys
 
03:31:21.889 --> 03:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
that included information on on teenage
 
03:31:25.130 --> 03:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
suicides suggested that
 
03:31:28.370 --> 03:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
something like 40 of our young people
 
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
have considered seriously considered
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
suicide within the last 30 days that is
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest things we are facing
 
03:31:37.550 --> 03:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
right now and I would hate to even
 
03:31:40.610 --> 03:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
possibly see anything detract from that
 
03:31:42.769 --> 03:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
number or from possibly going to a
 
03:31:45.950 --> 03:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:48.290 --> 03:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
03:31:49.490 --> 03:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:31:51.469 --> 03:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
I think when you have a universal number
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
just like you have a dispatch number
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's a delay between
 
03:31:59.389 --> 03:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
using that number and then the referral
 
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
particularly if it isn't for a crisis
 
03:32:03.290 --> 03:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
situation like an immediate situation
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's like suicide or maybe overdose
 
03:32:08.650 --> 03:32:08.660 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
 
03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders is a special category I
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
mean I I just can't
 
03:32:17.330 --> 03:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
I guess I can't convince people who
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
haven't had the experience of dealing
 
03:32:20.929 --> 03:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
with people that have had eating
 
03:32:20.939 --> 03:32:21.950 align:start position:0%
with people that have had eating
disorders

03:32:21.950 --> 03:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
disorders
 
03:32:24.170 --> 03:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's a whole different ball
 
03:32:26.990 --> 03:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
game it's a different ball game than uh
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
depression you it's it's a different
 
03:32:33.229 --> 03:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
ball game than drug addiction
 
03:32:35.650 --> 03:32:35.660 align:start position:0%
um it's a different ball game than than
 
03:32:40.309 --> 03:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh accidents and first aid and uh EMT
 
03:32:40.319 --> 03:32:41.750 align:start position:0%
uh accidents and first aid and uh EMT
work

03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:32:45.769 --> 03:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
um it's very specific and if it isn't
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
handled correctly right at the beginning
 
03:32:50.690 --> 03:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
of the of the interaction with the
 
03:32:50.700 --> 03:32:51.769 align:start position:0%
of the of the interaction with the
person

03:32:51.769 --> 03:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
if they're not knowledgeable you know
 
03:32:57.710 --> 03:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
things can go south really fast and
 
03:33:00.769 --> 03:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
um and the person will just either hang
 
03:33:04.370 --> 03:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
up or or take it even as more of a
 
03:33:07.550 --> 03:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
indication that what they're doing uh to
 
03:33:09.769 --> 03:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
themselves is either good or you know
 
03:33:12.349 --> 03:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
that they that it they internalize it I
 
03:33:16.130 --> 03:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
guess I I I'll put it that way so it's
 
03:33:18.170 --> 03:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's really important and both these
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
numbers can be called or text
 
03:33:22.969 --> 03:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
03:33:25.490 --> 03:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
um you know if you want a garden variety
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
of of phone numbers to call
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think that's going
 
03:33:33.170 --> 03:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
to happen because as as representative
 
03:33:36.290 --> 03:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
dryers said at least for a lot of the
 
03:33:38.570 --> 03:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
crisis things where you you have like a
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
dispatcher who can immediately go and
 
03:33:42.830 --> 03:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
defuse the situation and send out the
 
03:33:46.190 --> 03:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
emergency uh or get the person contacted
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
with somebody that's an emergency
 
03:33:51.530 --> 03:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
um you know that's being Consolidated
 
03:33:55.370 --> 03:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
but this this is a it's a big issue I
 
03:33:56.690 --> 03:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
mean it's a big issue and it probably
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
kills more people more teenagers
 
03:34:01.849 --> 03:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
um in the long run and and if it doesn't
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
kill them
 
03:34:06.070 --> 03:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a woman on my road
 
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
that is um she must be she must be in
 
03:34:13.010 --> 03:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
her 60s or yeah I'd say 50s or 60s right
 
03:34:13.020 --> 03:34:14.690 align:start position:0%
her 60s or yeah I'd say 50s or 60s right
now

03:34:14.690 --> 03:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
she is now at um a residential
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
situation uh but it's one where they can
 
03:34:25.490 --> 03:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
they can leave and it doesn't I bet you
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
on Friday when we get 10 below she'll
 
03:34:30.769 --> 03:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
still be walking the road and her her
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
face her body is so distorted
 
03:34:37.389 --> 03:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
um it's unbelievable she's anti-social
 
03:34:40.010 --> 03:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
as far as being able to deal with other
 
03:34:42.830 --> 03:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
people because of her physical Outlook
 
03:34:42.840 --> 03:34:44.090 align:start position:0%
people because of her physical Outlook
now

03:34:44.090 --> 03:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:34:48.010 --> 03:34:48.020 align:start position:0%
um and yet she can't drop the the the
 
03:34:51.530 --> 03:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
repetitive exercise to keep her you know
 
03:34:53.210 --> 03:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
just Skin and Bones I mean it's it's
 
03:34:53.220 --> 03:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
just Skin and Bones I mean it's it's
really

03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:34:56.450 --> 03:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
um just a horrible situation and she's
 
03:34:58.969 --> 03:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
been dealing with it like I said for 50
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
or 60 years she comes from a family that
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
I know that has all the resources in the
 
03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:05.030 align:start position:0%
I know that has all the resources in the
world

03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
world
 
03:35:07.250 --> 03:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and she she just hasn't been able to
 
03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
beat it so
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
um I guess I I and the fact that the
 
03:35:13.969 --> 03:35:13.979 align:start position:0%
young man that came and talked to us the
 
03:35:16.849 --> 03:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
other day I mean just the fact that he
 
03:35:20.690 --> 03:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
was he didn't go to 988 he went to the
 
03:35:22.490 --> 03:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
he went to his Google and he looked up
 
03:35:24.170 --> 03:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
eating disorders and he got the Eating
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
Disorders number
 
03:35:28.130 --> 03:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
03:35:31.309 --> 03:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
he's just one example of what kids do
 
03:35:31.319 --> 03:35:33.469 align:start position:0%
he's just one example of what kids do
and

03:35:33.469 --> 03:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:36.349 --> 03:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
um so I guess
 
03:35:39.229 --> 03:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
I I've given it my best but I really
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
think this is something that needs to be
 
03:35:44.809 --> 03:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
very special and very much on their ID
 
03:35:47.690 --> 03:35:47.700 align:start position:0%

Mr chair yes uh could we not put this on

consent so that he can be recognized
 
03:59:00.530 --> 03:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
from the floor we're going to not to
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
pass as amended now and Jennifer 4 we
 
03:59:05.929 --> 03:59:05.939 align:start position:0%
have two amendments here when we
 
03:59:08.030 --> 03:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
take this over to Olas will they
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
consolidate this into one Amendment
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
people have to do
 
03:59:17.330 --> 03:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:17.340 --> 03:59:23.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:59:23.229 --> 03:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
amendment number and that new amendment
 
03:59:27.889 --> 03:59:27.899 align:start position:0%
number is what we see in the calendar
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
yes okay so that's sop
 
03:59:32.570 --> 03:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
good that's the way we've operated
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
before so what we're going to do is
 
03:59:36.889 --> 03:59:36.899 align:start position:0%
we're going to prove uh the bill as
 
03:59:40.370 --> 03:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
amended by both of these numbered
 
03:59:43.490 --> 03:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
amendments and then we will later in the
 
03:59:46.250 --> 03:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
calendar see a different amendment
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
number which is incorporating the two
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
that we took care of here it's saving us
 
03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
from having to go over and get something
 
03:59:53.210 --> 03:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
written right now
 
03:59:54.950 --> 03:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
everybody got that
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
03:59:58.849 --> 03:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
04:00:00.650 --> 04:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
we've amended
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
um this bill twice so we now have on the

uh House Bill 35
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%

octopaths as amended with the two
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%

04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
we normally don't do this commenting we
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot to go so at the end of the
 
04:03:03.969 --> 04:03:03.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%

HB 45 uh this deals with uh loan
 
04:03:19.920 --> 04:03:26.150 align:start position:0%

04:03:36.889 --> 04:03:36.899 align:start position:0%
it would be a committee Amendment
 
04:03:39.410 --> 04:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
because it's you know the majority has
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
approved both and that's what we want a
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment not amendments in
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
anybody's name so so when you combine
 
04:03:47.450 --> 04:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
them that's what we normally do is make
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
it a committee on Monday
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%

04:04:02.170 --> 04:04:02.180 align:start position:0%
no I reported myself
 
04:04:04.969 --> 04:04:04.979 align:start position:0%

04:04:28.090 --> 04:04:28.100 align:start position:0%
through the calculator
 
04:04:31.750 --> 04:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a words person remember that
 
04:04:34.370 --> 04:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
excuse me I I recognize representative
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.450 --> 04:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.050 --> 04:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
okay let's get into the uh opening up HP
 
04:04:48.060 --> 04:04:57.710 align:start position:0%
okay let's get into the uh opening up HP
45

04:04:57.710 --> 04:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.720 --> 04:05:00.429 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:05:00.429 --> 04:05:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:02.809 --> 04:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study student
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness in New Hampshire
 
04:05:08.809 --> 04:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative McDonald
 
04:05:10.490 --> 04:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
04:05:13.490 --> 04:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I move that we find House Bill
 
04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
45 and expedient to legislate is there a
 
04:05:16.319 --> 04:05:17.630 align:start position:0%
45 and expedient to legislate is there a
second

04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:05:20.450 --> 04:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
second a second
 
04:05:26.570 --> 04:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
Professor McDonald do you care to speak
 
04:05:30.889 --> 04:05:30.899 align:start position:0%
to your motion
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
I believe that this bill is finding a
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
study committee that is unnecessary as
 
04:05:38.809 --> 04:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
there are other movements currently
 
04:05:40.250 --> 04:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
throughout the country to study this
 
04:05:42.290 --> 04:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
issue thank you you're welcome
 
04:05:44.929 --> 04:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
04:05:48.290 --> 04:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh just that um we have I think a
 
04:05:50.809 --> 04:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
committee to look at uh eliminating
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
committees uh so I don't think we need
 
04:05:55.849 --> 04:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
04:05:57.469 --> 04:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
um at this point
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add a couple words in there
 
04:06:03.530 --> 04:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
the when we look at committee membership
 
04:06:05.210 --> 04:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
you see three members of the house and
 
04:06:07.969 --> 04:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
three members of the Senate
 
04:06:10.130 --> 04:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
I doubt very seriously the Senate would
 
04:06:12.650 --> 04:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
ever put three members up and in the
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we're oftentimes lucky to
 
04:06:17.090 --> 04:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
get one member serving from the Senate
 
04:06:19.610 --> 04:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
um uh and I think most people recognize
 
04:06:22.490 --> 04:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
that yes represent Tanner well I totally
 
04:06:24.889 --> 04:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
agree with you and that's probably you
 
04:06:27.650 --> 04:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
know what I'm looking at the bill as I
 
04:06:30.050 --> 04:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
also realize that that student loans are
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
one of the major things in New Hampshire
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have the highest student loan debt in
 
04:06:36.889 --> 04:06:36.899 align:start position:0%
the nation and
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
um I think while other people are
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
studying it
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
um that New Hampshire needs to address
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
this problem the funding for higher
 
04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
education oh I I agree on that
 
04:06:50.450 --> 04:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely in fact we may have the
 
04:06:50.460 --> 04:06:51.349 align:start position:0%
absolutely in fact we may have the
highest

04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
highest
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
maybe second of Vermont but the highest
 
04:06:57.530 --> 04:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
student loan debt but our students in
 
04:06:58.610 --> 04:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
do not default on their student debt
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
they pay it off whereas in other states
 
04:07:06.769 --> 04:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
it's contrary so we do have a problem
 
04:07:09.410 --> 04:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
with the cost of Education in the state
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%

represent Damon
 
04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
I acknowledge what has been said and
 
04:07:18.650 --> 04:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire students do pay back
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
their debt but a considerable
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
compromising cost in their lives going
 
04:07:24.840 --> 04:07:26.210 align:start position:0%
compromising cost in their lives going
forward

04:07:26.210 --> 04:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:07:29.210 --> 04:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a very serious local
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
issue and we're doing a disservice to
 
04:07:35.809 --> 04:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
our students and our communities to not
 
04:07:37.610 --> 04:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
address it
 
04:07:37.620 --> 04:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
address it

having recently gone through several
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
FAFSA applications on my own I know that
 
04:07:47.450 --> 04:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
students entering College have to go
 
04:07:49.070 --> 04:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
through an extensive educational
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
training on what will be entailed and
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
taking on these loans and they have the
 
04:07:57.530 --> 04:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
option to click yes or no and they fully
 
04:07:59.689 --> 04:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
take that on if they have actually done
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
the videos and their parents haven't
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
been the ones doing them for them they
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
should enter this agreement knowing full
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
well what they will be encountering
 
04:08:10.130 --> 04:08:10.140 align:start position:0%

Professor Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
04:08:16.849 --> 04:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
just briefly the concept of of
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
forgiveness of a loan brings the mind
 
04:08:19.490 --> 04:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
the idea that there was something
 
04:08:22.250 --> 04:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
predatory done to these students and and
 
04:08:23.450 --> 04:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent I think there's
 
04:08:25.010 --> 04:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
something true there there is something
 
04:08:25.020 --> 04:08:26.330 align:start position:0%
something true there there is something
true

04:08:26.330 --> 04:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:08:28.729 --> 04:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
but the entity responsible for being
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
predatory to these students was not the
 
04:08:32.929 --> 04:08:32.939 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if anybody is responsible it
 
04:08:34.370 --> 04:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
was certain colleges and universities
 
04:08:36.050 --> 04:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
who brought students in the programs
 
04:08:37.490 --> 04:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
knowing well that they wouldn't be able
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
to repay easily the loans they're taking
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
out which is why I would be generally in
 
04:08:44.510 --> 04:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to this unless it was
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
specifically oriented toward looking at
 
04:08:48.410 --> 04:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
the one predatory party and bringing
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
these students in which is the
 
04:08:52.490 --> 04:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
endowments of universities
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to add into that last year
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
we passed under adequacy personal
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
finance literacy
 
04:09:00.170 --> 04:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
and it's it can be attached to the
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
economics courses were taught in high
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
school I think it's incumbent upon us as
 
04:09:06.170 --> 04:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
Educators in the in the high school
 
04:09:08.090 --> 04:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
level to really
 
04:09:11.769 --> 04:09:11.779 align:start position:0%
teach students the the the
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
ramifications of taking on this type of
 
04:09:16.849 --> 04:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
debt how to use your credit cards what a
 
04:09:18.769 --> 04:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
savings account is
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
um what a budget is uh all that and
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why we had the
 
04:09:26.450 --> 04:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bankers Association coming
 
04:09:28.969 --> 04:09:28.979 align:start position:0%
in so vehemently and pushing that bill
 
04:09:32.090 --> 04:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
last year and now it is part of our
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
adequacy personal finance literacy is
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
important and I do agree that student
 
04:09:40.610 --> 04:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness is a critical issue
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
along with our teacher shortage which we
 
04:09:45.650 --> 04:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
have in the state and and many are
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
getting out because of that debt and the
 
04:09:50.570 --> 04:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
what they're being paid as teachers
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't help them in paying off that
 
04:09:55.729 --> 04:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
debt that's why you're also seeing many
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
teacher preparation programs in colleges
 
04:10:02.090 --> 04:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
where the enrollment is declining
 
04:10:04.809 --> 04:10:04.819 align:start position:0%
um yes represent my way
 
04:10:07.309 --> 04:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the responsibility that
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
one takes on
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why they take on this debt at
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
least in this state is because our
 
04:10:15.769 --> 04:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
higher education is underfunded
 
04:10:18.590 --> 04:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
and we forget that sometimes
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
and we have the highest
 
04:10:23.330 --> 04:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
for those who are going to our state
 
04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
schools particularly unh
 
04:10:27.469 --> 04:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
we have the highest
 
04:10:30.889 --> 04:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
Public School tuition in the country
 
04:10:32.809 --> 04:10:32.819 align:start position:0%
and that's because this state does not
 
04:10:36.110 --> 04:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
provide the kind of uh support for
 
04:10:38.570 --> 04:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
higher education and those ultimately
 
04:10:41.090 --> 04:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
hopefully will stay in the school stay
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
in the state and provide a sound economy
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
and so that's the concern that I have
 
04:10:49.010 --> 04:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
about not looking at this bill is that
 
04:10:51.650 --> 04:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
once again this legislature gets off
 
04:10:53.689 --> 04:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
by not providing the kind of funding
 
04:10:55.969 --> 04:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
that needs to be taken place with our
 
04:10:58.570 --> 04:10:58.580 align:start position:0%
higher education institutions thank you
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
represent parano yes representative
 
04:11:03.469 --> 04:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
Miler could you point to where in this
 
04:11:05.450 --> 04:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
legislation IT addresses the
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
underfunding of our education
 
04:11:11.330 --> 04:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
yes if I may respond the issue of
 
04:11:13.070 --> 04:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
underfunding this school has been a long
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
tradition in this state and so kids who
 
04:11:17.809 --> 04:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
are going to go to Pro our Public
 
04:11:17.819 --> 04:11:19.189 align:start position:0%
are going to go to Pro our Public
Schools

04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
they have to take out loans
 
04:11:24.110 --> 04:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
we have we have places we I have friends
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
of mine who send their students their
 
04:11:29.210 --> 04:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
children out of state and they pay out
 
04:11:31.729 --> 04:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
of state tuition is cheaper than what
 
04:11:33.650 --> 04:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition is here
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
so that's the concern that I have that
 
04:11:37.929 --> 04:11:37.939 align:start position:0%
we we are not meeting our obligations
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
from a state to provide the appropriate
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
resources for higher education to keep
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
the tuition lower thank you and we're
 
04:11:47.689 --> 04:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
going to save this and we'll have to
 
04:11:49.570 --> 04:11:49.580 align:start position:0%
take a break go ahead representative
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
Balboni and then represent luno I'm just
 
04:11:55.010 --> 04:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
getting back to the bill at hand the
 
04:11:56.750 --> 04:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill isn't asking us to solve the
 
04:11:58.670 --> 04:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
problem right now is just stating that
 
04:12:00.110 --> 04:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
we should put together a committee to
 
04:12:04.969 --> 04:12:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:07.849 --> 04:12:07.859 align:start position:0%
represent Luna thank you very much Mr
 
04:12:07.859 --> 04:12:08.689 align:start position:0%
represent Luna thank you very much Mr
chair

04:12:08.689 --> 04:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:12:10.250 --> 04:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
um you know I also think there's there's
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
a certain timely timeliness sorry to
 
04:12:17.469 --> 04:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
um to to uh to household 45
 
04:12:20.210 --> 04:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and you know setting up
 
04:12:23.330 --> 04:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
um uh student loan forgiveness and I
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
think in conjunction with some other
 
04:12:29.809 --> 04:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
conversations that are going on uh
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
around the state right now surrounding
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
um you know a possible program called
 
04:12:37.849 --> 04:12:37.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire promise uh much like what
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing in Vermont right now which
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
04:12:45.170 --> 04:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
um basically the uh the the state would
 
04:12:48.969 --> 04:12:48.979 align:start position:0%
guarantee for for Pell eligible students
 
04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
enrolling in Community College the
 
04:12:53.150 --> 04:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
difference in intuition between what
 
04:12:55.729 --> 04:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
what Pell gives them and in the price
 
04:12:59.090 --> 04:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
Community College we have um
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
we have I think maybe the highest price
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh Community College uh tuition in the
 
04:13:08.809 --> 04:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh in the country but as I think many
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
most people know we've we've Frozen
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
tuition for the last
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
maybe decade and uh and over that period
 
04:13:19.250 --> 04:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
of time the the Pell Grant amount has
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
has really has has approached within a
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
couple hundred dollars what uh what a
 
04:13:24.830 --> 04:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
full what full-time
 
04:13:27.410 --> 04:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
um uh full-time student tuition would be
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
at our community colleges so as we
 
04:13:30.889 --> 04:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
consider things like New Hampshire
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
promise I think it's I think it's it's
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's certainly fair for us to uh to also
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
study student loan forgiveness and and
 
04:13:42.410 --> 04:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
what may uh come out of that as as um as
 
04:13:45.050 --> 04:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
as part of this effort thank you it
 
04:13:46.370 --> 04:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
might be interesting to note that we do
 
04:13:48.050 --> 04:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
have a higher education commission or
 
04:13:49.969 --> 04:13:49.979 align:start position:0%
committee here in the legislature
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
already and there's no reason why the
 
04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
issue of student debt student tuition
 
04:13:58.729 --> 04:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be taken up by that particular
 
04:14:00.889 --> 04:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
committee and it would be a stat it
 
04:14:02.450 --> 04:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be stopped putting
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
another committee it's been both parties
 
04:14:07.070 --> 04:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
put forth we have too many commissions
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
and too many committees and here we are
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
forming another one uh when we already
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.080 --> 04:14:17.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:14:17.330 --> 04:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you over
 
04:14:20.929 --> 04:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
there chair uh just a question for you I
 
04:14:22.990 --> 04:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
forgot you're on the education board
 
04:14:26.929 --> 04:14:26.939 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire ranked 49th or 50th
 
04:14:29.570 --> 04:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
in funding of their state colleges you
 
04:14:31.250 --> 04:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
know it bounces back and forth between
 
04:14:33.309 --> 04:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
UVM and us
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
but UVM has a different way of looking
 
04:14:38.929 --> 04:14:38.939 align:start position:0%
at their applications eighty percent of
 
04:14:41.090 --> 04:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
their students come from out of state
 
04:14:45.290 --> 04:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
where here it's down around 55 or so
 
04:14:45.300 --> 04:14:46.309 align:start position:0%
where here it's down around 55 or so
percent

04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:14:50.689 --> 04:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
and so they are able to maintain
 
04:14:53.450 --> 04:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
barely due to the result of what they're
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
taking from out of state students
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're becoming a semi-private school
 
04:14:58.849 --> 04:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
if you're in Vermont elsewhere you're
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to go to Castleton or Northern
 
04:15:03.410 --> 04:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
University of Vermont so
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
um comparing ourselves to we we're
 
04:15:08.570 --> 04:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
there's no question we're right there so
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
so regardless of UVM in the country
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
we're either 49th or 50th we're at the
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
bottom one or two in the country of
 
04:15:17.689 --> 04:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
funding public education
 
04:15:17.699 --> 04:15:19.090 align:start position:0%
funding public education
10

04:15:19.090 --> 04:15:19.100 align:start position:0%
10
 
04:15:22.610 --> 04:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
12-16 yes I know that okay now that's a
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
question that's all we are as a state
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
when we put this budget together and you
 
04:15:27.530 --> 04:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
probably hear from them when the
 
04:15:29.809 --> 04:15:29.819 align:start position:0%
governor presents it that we're putting
 
04:15:32.450 --> 04:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
more into Capital Improvements for the
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
University system than we have in the
 
04:15:37.490 --> 04:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
past and that's jumping up significantly
 
04:15:40.130 --> 04:15:40.140 align:start position:0%
simply because we're trying to support
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
Granite guarantee which if you're if
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
you're a student in New Hampshire of a
 
04:15:46.610 --> 04:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
certain property level you can go
 
04:15:48.530 --> 04:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
tuition free to the university system
 
04:15:50.269 --> 04:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
here in this state
 
04:15:54.530 --> 04:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot more to this that we
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
need to discuss thank you yes represent
 
04:16:00.050 --> 04:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you uh the problem I see
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
with any of these student loan
 
04:16:03.290 --> 04:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
forgiveness programs is
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we forgive uh student loans today
 
04:16:08.689 --> 04:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
what happens in five years five years
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do another loan
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program the real real
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
problem is the cost of college
 
04:16:18.290 --> 04:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
um there you can read papers and studies
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
until the cows come home
 
04:16:23.570 --> 04:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
um about that but we need to do
 
04:16:25.309 --> 04:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
something about that
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
um this student loan forgiveness is just
 
04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
a Band-Aid
 
04:16:32.570 --> 04:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
person wake up it's the response a
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
committee might like this may have to
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
look into that issue rather than
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
this is not a unique problem just to New
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh how many of us have
 
04:16:45.769 --> 04:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
children that gone to school in other
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
states I have one that's uh
 
04:16:52.010 --> 04:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
hurry up in her middle 40s still paying
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
off her master's program from University
 
04:16:56.150 --> 04:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
of South Carolina Medics medical school
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
and Audiology still paying that debt so
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.010 --> 04:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
yes representino
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
I I would also argue that just helping
 
04:17:12.170 --> 04:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
students pay off their debt in the state
 
04:17:13.969 --> 04:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or having attended our
 
04:17:15.889 --> 04:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
University's New Hampshire University
 
04:17:15.899 --> 04:17:17.330 align:start position:0%
University's New Hampshire University
schools

04:17:17.330 --> 04:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:17:18.889 --> 04:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
um doesn't guarantee that they will stay
 
04:17:21.290 --> 04:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
in the state and that was what the
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimony was stating
 
04:17:26.150 --> 04:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we exported a lot of college
 
04:17:27.950 --> 04:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
students out of the state representative
 
04:17:27.960 --> 04:17:29.689 align:start position:0%
students out of the state representative
Tanner

04:17:29.689 --> 04:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
Tanner
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
so um thank you I I got my teaching
 
04:17:32.880 --> 04:17:33.830 align:start position:0%
so um thank you I I got my teaching
degree

04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
degree
 
04:17:35.809 --> 04:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
at the same time there was a teacher
 
04:17:37.849 --> 04:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
shortage I mean we we go on these cycles
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that that they did
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
was if you taught in a school district
 
04:17:47.570 --> 04:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
that was considered a high-risk District
 
04:17:50.090 --> 04:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
or a district that had low property
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
values a certain point percentage of
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
your college loan was was forgiven and I
 
04:17:57.050 --> 04:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
think those are the kinds of programs
 
04:17:59.630 --> 04:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
that that really are needed we talked
 
04:18:01.849 --> 04:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
about it with nurses and social workers
 
04:18:03.769 --> 04:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
during the covid
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
um epidemic and and uh so I think
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of alternatives to loan
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
forgiveness rather than some some people
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
I think think it's just a carte blanche
 
04:18:14.689 --> 04:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
you know write it off kind of thing but
 
04:18:16.610 --> 04:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
there are different loan forgiveness
 
04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
programs and we do have a teacher
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
shortage committee currently that exists
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's a Senate bill and we lost the
 
04:18:28.250 --> 04:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
senator which was chair of that dude he
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
is not coming back so we need to put
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
another person in that place but this is
 
04:18:34.670 --> 04:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
another topic which is being discussed
 
04:18:36.410 --> 04:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
by that committee
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
how to maintain and keep our teachers in
 
04:18:42.710 --> 04:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay before we're going to take any
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
action on this I'm going to wait for the
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
one member to come back
 
04:18:51.769 --> 04:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
so we are at a break here
 
04:18:53.689 --> 04:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
for about this for a few minutes pardon
 
04:18:56.090 --> 04:18:56.100 align:start position:0%

45 it's a bill that's itl it deals with
 
04:27:22.610 --> 04:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh loan forgiveness a committee
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
establishment to evaluate and assess
 
04:27:27.309 --> 04:27:27.319 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness

04:28:35.460 --> 04:28:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:28:54.050 --> 04:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:56.689 --> 04:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
for those that are new to how we do this
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
you'll see sometimes on the calendar the
 
04:29:01.070 --> 04:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
vote might be you know there's 18 people
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
on a committee and it might be seven two
 
04:29:03.840 --> 04:29:05.149 align:start position:0%
on a committee and it might be seven two
five

04:29:05.149 --> 04:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's just the others weren't there
 
04:29:08.570 --> 04:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's all there's do you want to ask if
 
04:29:10.130 --> 04:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
there's a minority
 
04:29:12.410 --> 04:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
yeah we will do that
 
04:29:19.010 --> 04:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.020 --> 04:29:20.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:29:20.269 --> 04:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna jump down and I'm going
 
04:29:24.050 --> 04:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
to try to address some of these early
 
04:29:25.910 --> 04:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
bills I we got to get them out of
 
04:29:25.920 --> 04:29:26.809 align:start position:0%
bills I we got to get them out of
committee

04:29:26.809 --> 04:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to start with the bottom
 
04:29:30.670 --> 04:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
one that I have on my list it's 578 here
 
04:29:44.450 --> 04:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay this bill establishes the position
 
04:29:55.130 --> 04:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
of reporting administrator in the
 
04:29:57.290 --> 04:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
04:30:01.250 --> 04:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
HB 578 it is a finance bill and it is an
 
04:30:02.809 --> 04:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
early bill that means we have to have it
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
out of committee by the 16th of the of
 
04:30:06.769 --> 04:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
this month
 
04:30:06.779 --> 04:30:11.450 align:start position:0%
this month
emotion

04:30:11.450 --> 04:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
oh yeah give I'm going to give the gavel
 
04:30:16.670 --> 04:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
over to represent cordelli thank you
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:30:20.809 --> 04:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
um I would call on chairman lad for a
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
motion I I moved that this uh Bill b itl
 
04:30:28.809 --> 04:30:28.819 align:start position:0%
was their second representative miler
 
04:30:28.819 --> 04:30:30.769 align:start position:0%
was their second representative miler
discussion

04:30:30.769 --> 04:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:30:30.779 --> 04:30:32.030 align:start position:0%
discussion
yeah

04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:30:32.040 --> 04:30:33.110 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:36.170 --> 04:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
typically we when we uh approve new
 
04:30:39.170 --> 04:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
positions over at the Department of
 
04:30:41.929 --> 04:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
Education we want to ensure that this a
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
position is in line with priorities of
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
the department the legislature and what
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be best in fact for our
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
students in our state
 
04:30:53.450 --> 04:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
and when I look at the duties and
 
04:30:55.370 --> 04:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of this particular bill
 
04:30:59.450 --> 04:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
is to basically receive and coordinate
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
all these reports which come to into the
 
04:31:04.370 --> 04:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
department one of those reports is you
 
04:31:06.349 --> 04:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
got to hand in from the school districts
 
04:31:09.889 --> 04:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
your policy on gifted talented education
 
04:31:12.050 --> 04:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
we provide no money for gifted talented
 
04:31:14.210 --> 04:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
education in the state we know there
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
might be policies on that but we don't
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
provide any you know funding for that
 
04:31:21.170 --> 04:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
and districts may have that but that's
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
funded on their own recognizance so
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
um at this point in time I see that as a
 
04:31:28.969 --> 04:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
position that's
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
um that that duty alone doesn't make it
 
04:31:35.809 --> 04:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
with me secondly uh to look at the
 
04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
accountability reports for the
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grip grants which we
 
04:31:42.889 --> 04:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
provide that's approximately 14.2 or so
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars and we'll go on to nine
 
04:31:47.630 --> 04:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars it's less and these are
 
04:31:49.550 --> 04:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
reports that you've got to report as to
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
how you're using these monies that you
 
04:31:54.649 --> 04:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
receive there's going to be a bill Ford
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
which we have which is going to move
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
that those monies be unrestricted and so
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
it would be no need for a report to Doe
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
other reports are the third grade
 
04:32:06.180 --> 04:32:07.570 align:start position:0%
other reports are the third grade
reading

04:32:07.570 --> 04:32:07.580 align:start position:0%
reading
 
04:32:09.530 --> 04:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
there's a number of ways we're looking
 
04:32:11.149 --> 04:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
at spending that limited amount of
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars there that is also part third
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
grade reading is part of the
 
04:32:19.070 --> 04:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
differentiate Aid within adequacy and
 
04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
that funding is part of the adequate
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
formula which includes base adequacy in
 
04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
the four components of differentiated
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
Aid and that money is given not given
 
04:32:30.769 --> 04:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
but provided to districts to use it for
 
04:32:33.170 --> 04:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
by the districts to attain and deliver
 
04:32:35.210 --> 04:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
an adequate education it doesn't
 
04:32:37.130 --> 04:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
specifically say You must use this for
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
um looking at some of the other
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
requirements is other reported
 
04:32:45.189 --> 04:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
requirements established in law
 
04:32:49.130 --> 04:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time my my I guess
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern is that we have a
 
04:32:52.809 --> 04:32:52.819 align:start position:0%
lot of programs where we're looking at
 
04:32:56.510 --> 04:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
funding uh areas which really have will
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
make a dramatic and change in
 
04:32:59.570 --> 04:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
instructional curriculum in the in
 
04:33:02.689 --> 04:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
schools building schools Etc I don't
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
think that this is a time we should be
 
04:33:06.890 --> 04:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
putting money in a direction that is not
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary or required so this
 
04:33:14.051 --> 04:33:14.061 align:start position:0%
is why I put forth the itl motion
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.490 --> 04:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
wow uh seen none

04:35:59.390 --> 04:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
pamphlet that was put out by nofa New
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire explaining their situation I
 
04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
think that after a morning of discussing
 
04:36:07.490 --> 04:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
school funding it would be inappropriate
 
04:36:10.849 --> 04:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
to take money from
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
the school system that's having trouble
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
funding its own students and invest that
 
04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
money and and in turn invest that money
 
04:36:22.429 --> 04:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:26.330 --> 04:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
represent uh cordelli nothing further
 
04:36:28.730 --> 04:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:36:30.769 --> 04:36:30.779 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:34.131 --> 04:36:34.141 align:start position:0%
uh coming from Sullivan County which is
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
a has a high agricultural Heritage to it
 
04:36:39.480 --> 04:36:40.189 align:start position:0%
a has a high agricultural Heritage to it
um

04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think the more we can support our
 
04:36:46.449 --> 04:36:46.459 align:start position:0%
local farms would be is is fantastic
 
04:36:50.029 --> 04:36:50.039 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly simple program the
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
amount of money may seem like
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
astronomical but as we just said the 165
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
000 was not
 
04:37:00.289 --> 04:37:00.299 align:start position:0%
um a big chunk concerned of what we
 
04:37:02.570 --> 04:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
normally do here I actually have an
 
04:37:06.529 --> 04:37:06.539 align:start position:0%
amendment from the sponsor for this bill
 
04:37:09.470 --> 04:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I think it it's
 
04:37:12.410 --> 04:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
the more children learn where food comes
 
04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
from and good food comes from and and
 
04:37:17.330 --> 04:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
the connection with the local farmers
 
04:37:20.631 --> 04:37:20.641 align:start position:0%
and the uh influx of maybe a small
 
04:37:23.631 --> 04:37:23.641 align:start position:0%
amount of money into the local economy
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
um would be great and so I don't see
 
04:37:31.551 --> 04:37:31.561 align:start position:0%
this again as an either or that you're
 
04:37:33.890 --> 04:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
taking money vital money away from local
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
schools I see it as promoting a program
 
04:37:38.269 --> 04:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
promoting the local economy and
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully that local economy supports
 
04:37:43.131 --> 04:37:43.141 align:start position:0%
the schools more thank you
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent perineal
 
04:37:48.410 --> 04:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
are the schools in the business of
 
04:37:54.170 --> 04:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
did you hear what she just said
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
oh okay I so heard somebody say what
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
question was going out and I thought
 
04:38:10.429 --> 04:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
well maybe it's going out to the
 
04:38:11.689 --> 04:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
committee and then I looked over here
 
04:38:13.490 --> 04:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
and saw represent Allison I said did you
 
04:38:15.170 --> 04:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
hear the question I thought he was
 
04:38:18.349 --> 04:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
trying to respond so okay
 
04:38:21.170 --> 04:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
your questions to you next one no but he
 
04:38:23.330 --> 04:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
I think he had his didn't you have your
 
04:38:25.869 --> 04:38:25.879 align:start position:0%
hand going up or anything like that
 
04:38:28.010 --> 04:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
well see I thought you were going to
 
04:38:29.890 --> 04:38:29.900 align:start position:0%
respond to the question
 
04:38:34.670 --> 04:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.890 --> 04:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
and then if I could make my comment
 
04:38:43.449 --> 04:38:43.459 align:start position:0%
after that I'd appreciate it
 
04:38:48.410 --> 04:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that that yeah I'm not sure
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
the local school district has a
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility for uh improving local
 
04:38:56.269 --> 04:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
economies but I I I think it's a good
 
04:38:58.250 --> 04:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
idea I don't think it's a responsibility
 
04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
but it's a good idea that's the answer
 
04:39:04.730 --> 04:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
of the question my comment is uh when we
 
04:39:06.650 --> 04:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on this bill and we've
 
04:39:09.529 --> 04:39:09.539 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of it over two years uh
 
04:39:11.090 --> 04:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
there were any number of issues that
 
04:39:13.131 --> 04:39:13.141 align:start position:0%
were raised one by the Commissioner of
 
04:39:15.769 --> 04:39:15.779 align:start position:0%
Agriculture who suggested when he
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
testified that there aren't enough there
 
04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
aren't enough producers of
 
04:39:25.369 --> 04:39:25.379 align:start position:0%
meat and fruit and so on in the state to
 
04:39:27.769 --> 04:39:27.779 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient amounts of money
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of product to schools
 
04:39:32.631 --> 04:39:32.641 align:start position:0%
and twelve hundred dollars per school I
 
04:39:34.250 --> 04:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
don't see that as a problem I live right
 
04:39:36.890 --> 04:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
next to an apple orchard which is 155
 
04:39:38.810 --> 04:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
acres and they have apples available
 
04:39:42.830 --> 04:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
with two Cold Storage year round any any
 
04:39:45.530 --> 04:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
reason well when the junior high the
 
04:39:46.788 --> 04:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
high school in Concord is going to use
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
up their 1200 on those apples fairly
 
04:39:51.650 --> 04:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
quickly uh all you have to do is go to
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
the farmer's market in any one of these
 
04:39:56.030 --> 04:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
areas but here in Concord uh we have a
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
winters Farmer Market there's three or
 
04:40:01.250 --> 04:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
four producers of meat there uh that is
 
04:40:04.670 --> 04:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
available year round uh I mean it's a
 
04:40:07.490 --> 04:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's a small program in terms of the
 
04:40:10.270 --> 04:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
scope of money that we're dealing with
 
04:40:13.788 --> 04:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
and the bill is a win for communities
 
04:40:18.730 --> 04:40:18.740 align:start position:0%
for families for kids for Farmers uh
 
04:40:21.490 --> 04:40:21.500 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm I'm
 
04:40:24.650 --> 04:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
puzzled that we we're dealing with uh
 
04:40:27.170 --> 04:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
you know so many objections to to
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
04:40:31.368 --> 04:40:31.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you're welcome uh
 
04:40:33.288 --> 04:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
04:40:37.368 --> 04:40:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.190 --> 04:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of farm to school I
 
04:40:42.170 --> 04:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
think we have a robust program here
 
04:40:46.250 --> 04:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
already what I don't like is a hundred
 
04:40:48.770 --> 04:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
and ninety five thousand dollars to do
 
04:40:51.948 --> 04:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
another position and 50 000 of that
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
being for setting up a program which is
 
04:40:56.208 --> 04:40:56.218 align:start position:0%
already in place in a number of schools
 
04:40:58.010 --> 04:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
I also
 
04:40:58.020 --> 04:40:58.788 align:start position:0%
I also
um

04:40:58.788 --> 04:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:02.810 --> 04:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
and unwilling to commit to a long-term
 
04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
funding of that position until we find
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
out if schools will actually jump on
 
04:41:09.770 --> 04:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
board with that like you said one
 
04:41:11.448 --> 04:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
thousand two hundred dollars that's the
 
04:41:14.630 --> 04:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
maximum is not a lot even for a small
 
04:41:17.868 --> 04:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
school uh and for I can't even imagine
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
for a large you know Union High School
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
that this would make it the worth the
 
04:41:25.610 --> 04:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
trouble to go through uh that they
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
couldn't already uh do on their own I am
 
04:41:32.208 --> 04:41:32.218 align:start position:0%
totally in favor of schools working with
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
Farms I'm totally in favor of making it
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
easy for the farms and schools to do
 
04:41:38.208 --> 04:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that setting up an
 
04:41:39.948 --> 04:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
extra person in
 
04:41:43.550 --> 04:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
conquered to oversee the problem of the
 
04:41:47.570 --> 04:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Tanner
 
04:41:52.610 --> 04:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment that that speaks to
 
04:41:55.570 --> 04:41:55.580 align:start position:0%
some of the appropriation for this bill
 
04:41:58.930 --> 04:41:58.940 align:start position:0%
but I do think that uh
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
the reason that I said that it's part of
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
the economy is that everything's tied
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
together when I talked about schools
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
before in poverty areas that it's a
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
vicious cycle that that industry doesn't
 
04:42:13.128 --> 04:42:13.138 align:start position:0%
come that
 
04:42:16.128 --> 04:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
um then people you know the property
 
04:42:18.530 --> 04:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
values go down and it's just it it kind
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
of churns I think this is a way to
 
04:42:21.840 --> 04:42:22.970 align:start position:0%
of churns I think this is a way to
actually

04:42:22.970 --> 04:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:42:25.490 --> 04:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
to spin it just the opposite way you
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
have uh areas rural areas in in New
 
04:42:28.920 --> 04:42:30.650 align:start position:0%
have uh areas rural areas in in New
Hampshire

04:42:30.650 --> 04:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
that really would Thrive I think on a on
 
04:42:36.010 --> 04:42:36.020 align:start position:0%
something like this we have in our area
 
04:42:39.708 --> 04:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
several Farms that have csas and we have
 
04:42:42.530 --> 04:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
Farm stands all year round and
 
04:42:44.930 --> 04:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
um north of us up in Margaret's areas
 
04:42:47.330 --> 04:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative arise area there's milk
 
04:42:49.610 --> 04:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
producers that that produce all kinds of
 
04:42:52.490 --> 04:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
different meat products as well as milk
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
products and I just think this is a
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
nudge a nudge to get schools involved
 
04:43:02.090 --> 04:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
um and they it's a it's an enabling bill
 
04:43:04.610 --> 04:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
it's opt-in it's not required that
 
04:43:04.620 --> 04:43:05.590 align:start position:0%
it's opt-in it's not required that
everybody

04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
performs in it and I think it would be
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
such a big Boon to the area and and to
 
04:43:13.390 --> 04:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
our counties thank you
 
04:43:16.670 --> 04:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
represent uh yes representative
 
04:43:19.128 --> 04:43:19.138 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out that online
 
04:43:21.530 --> 04:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
six one of one of the things that I
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
object to is that it says
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
only school districts participating in
 
04:43:27.410 --> 04:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
the national school lunch program shall
 
04:43:28.970 --> 04:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
be eligible for reimbursement because I
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
feel this discriminates against schools
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
not participating in the federal lunch
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
program so I just wanted to bring that
 
04:43:33.420 --> 04:43:34.128 align:start position:0%
program so I just wanted to bring that
up

04:43:34.128 --> 04:43:34.138 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:43:35.390 --> 04:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anyone wants to comment
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:41.030 --> 04:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison I'll comment on
 
04:43:44.090 --> 04:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
that uh we're this is tied into some
 
04:43:46.670 --> 04:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
other legislation coming before us on
 
04:43:48.890 --> 04:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
breakfast and luncheon who participates
 
04:43:51.050 --> 04:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
at this point we can only find one
 
04:43:52.368 --> 04:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
school district in the state that
 
04:43:54.170 --> 04:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't participate in the Federal
 
04:43:56.810 --> 04:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
program so I think your point is well
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
taken but we're talking about one school
 
04:43:58.440 --> 04:44:00.890 align:start position:0%
taken but we're talking about one school
district

04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.050 --> 04:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative parent now there's
 
04:44:05.208 --> 04:44:05.218 align:start position:0%
lots of conversation about how in
 
04:44:08.448 --> 04:44:08.458 align:start position:0%
certain counties there's an abundance of
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
farming and an abundance of food that
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
would Supply these schools however in my
 
04:44:15.890 --> 04:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
town of wolfborough we have a farmer's
 
04:44:19.128 --> 04:44:19.138 align:start position:0%
market every summer and part of the time
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
during the winter and they have a very
 
04:44:24.050 --> 04:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
hard time finding local farmers in fact
 
04:44:26.208 --> 04:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments is that there are
 
04:44:28.250 --> 04:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
several producers from Maine who come
 
04:44:31.250 --> 04:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
over and they have the abundance of the
 
04:44:34.490 --> 04:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
produce at our farmers market so not all
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:41.090 --> 04:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:44:41.100 --> 04:44:42.050 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
woodcock

04:44:42.050 --> 04:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
04:44:43.850 --> 04:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I would I would recognize that uh
 
04:44:48.650 --> 04:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative is accurate down in
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro to have a lot of looking on
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
besides farming
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
um but this is for the entire State of
 
04:44:55.970 --> 04:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire any product bought grown
 
04:44:57.890 --> 04:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Fitness after Carol
 
04:44:59.810 --> 04:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
come from Carroll County in Northern
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
Carroll County we happen to have quite a
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
few Farmers I'd be happy to participate
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
in this on the New Hampshire side I I
 
04:45:07.490 --> 04:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
can't find any reason why we would be
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
objecting to providing New Hampshire
 
04:45:12.590 --> 04:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
Farmers provide New Hampshire food to
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire schools uh in this state
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
and just keep the cycle of helping it's
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
all like a Career Education move but
 
04:45:20.330 --> 04:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
it's also great for the school system
 
04:45:22.610 --> 04:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
and for the farmers thank you the farm
 
04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
is a struggling yeah represent Hall
 
04:45:29.208 --> 04:45:29.218 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
actually another question the statement
 
04:45:30.480 --> 04:45:31.730 align:start position:0%
actually another question the statement
actually

04:45:31.730 --> 04:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
um in terms of okay I just had a brain
 
04:45:34.560 --> 04:45:37.570 align:start position:0%
um in terms of okay I just had a brain
crap

04:45:37.570 --> 04:45:37.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.368 --> 04:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
oh my God wait
 
04:45:40.378 --> 04:45:41.150 align:start position:0%
oh my God wait
um

04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:43.730 --> 04:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
oh I know I was gonna say yeah so we
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
talk about the farmers we're talking
 
04:45:47.090 --> 04:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
about the communities let's talk about
 
04:45:49.610 --> 04:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
what the kids are eating if the kids get
 
04:45:53.628 --> 04:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
this food it's a win-win thank you
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
profession Damon
 
04:45:57.708 --> 04:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
um echoing representative Paul it's
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
about the kids you need to be fed in
 
04:46:04.010 --> 04:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
order to have your maximum cognitive
 
04:46:06.770 --> 04:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
function and you need to be fed well
 
04:46:08.448 --> 04:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
I think this program will help children
 
04:46:10.970 --> 04:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
eat more of the good foods that are
 
04:46:15.128 --> 04:46:15.138 align:start position:0%
produced locally also Growers will grow
 
04:46:18.770 --> 04:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
to demand in other words if a school
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
system contracts with a farm I will buy
 
04:46:22.850 --> 04:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
your green beans as long as they you
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
have them through September into October
 
04:46:29.208 --> 04:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
they'll grow more of that crop so that's
 
04:46:31.310 --> 04:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
another version of availability and
 
04:46:33.530 --> 04:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
making it good for their economy and
 
04:46:36.530 --> 04:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
therefore good for the broader Community
 
04:46:39.890 --> 04:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
um and I neglected to say this the other
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
day there's less food waste when food
 
04:46:46.610 --> 04:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
is delivered from local production and
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
consumed locally and we have a major
 
04:46:50.090 --> 04:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
food waste problem in this country so
 
04:46:52.610 --> 04:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
it's a side benefit of this bill which I
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
vigorously support and frankly thought
 
04:46:56.810 --> 04:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
when I originally read it that it was a
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:02.270 --> 04:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
04:47:04.970 --> 04:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman there's nothing in
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
this bill that prohibits any school from
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
buying from any local Farm the maximum
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
is one thousand two hundred dollars for
 
04:47:16.730 --> 04:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
our school over the year that in a
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
school budget of 7 million is
 
04:47:23.930 --> 04:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
kittens this is not to make money for
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
the Farms or the schools it's to to
 
04:47:31.250 --> 04:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
nudge maybe but I think that we can
 
04:47:33.288 --> 04:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
nudge without spending for another
 
04:47:36.650 --> 04:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
person in Concord and another 50
 
04:47:39.770 --> 04:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
000 for it
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
represent cardelli
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I believe there's already a
 
04:47:47.690 --> 04:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
form to classroom program in the state
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
that seems quite active I think that
 
04:47:52.510 --> 04:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
that's the better vehicle for
 
04:47:55.010 --> 04:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
instructing our students on where their
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
food comes from then this program
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
Vegas for represent leckers
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
that was a good point because that's not
 
04:48:07.788 --> 04:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
in this bill I mean the instruction
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
isn't part of this but I did talk to my
 
04:48:13.368 --> 04:48:13.378 align:start position:0%
local Farm
 
04:48:16.430 --> 04:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
um who has tried numerous years the high
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
school and the farm have tried to work
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
out something that would work but what
 
04:48:23.448 --> 04:48:23.458 align:start position:0%
he said is I just can't produce things
 
04:48:26.570 --> 04:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
far enough into the season that it makes
 
04:48:30.890 --> 04:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
sense to have anything ongoing but
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
um and I like the idea of farms and
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
schools trying to work things out I
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
think that's great my concern is that
 
04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
in putting this program in that gives
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
schools a little bit of money to
 
04:48:47.690 --> 04:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
incentivize them we're spending a whole
 
04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
lot of money and the school will be
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
spending a whole lot of money to follow
 
04:48:54.288 --> 04:48:54.298 align:start position:0%
the rules right to track this is this
 
04:48:56.570 --> 04:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
really coming locally is this what you
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
know all that paperwork that gets
 
04:49:01.010 --> 04:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
generated whenever we start a program as
 
04:49:03.770 --> 04:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
opposed to just the school and the local
 
04:49:06.530 --> 04:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
Farm working together and doing this
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
without all this intervening another
 
04:49:12.288 --> 04:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
person at the doe another report that
 
04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
has to be done money trying to go back
 
04:49:17.570 --> 04:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
and forth for a a small amount of money
 
04:49:20.570 --> 04:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
it may cause some of the smaller schools
 
04:49:23.330 --> 04:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
more than that in somebody to track and
 
04:49:26.750 --> 04:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
do the paper you know all that stuff it
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's much better just left to the school
 
04:49:31.070 --> 04:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
than the local farms
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
to come up with something with works
 
04:49:35.090 --> 04:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
with them without having to put in all
 
04:49:37.930 --> 04:49:37.940 align:start position:0%
this governmental oversight and and
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and all that other stuff
 
04:49:42.530 --> 04:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
that makes it inefficient
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
04:49:47.570 --> 04:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
um on the nofa New Hampshire dot org
 
04:49:47.580 --> 04:49:48.770 align:start position:0%
um on the nofa New Hampshire dot org
website

04:49:48.770 --> 04:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
website
 
04:49:50.810 --> 04:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
um an underneath Farm to school in New
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it says that 149 schools in
 
04:49:55.970 --> 04:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are participating in farm
 
04:49:57.850 --> 04:49:57.860 align:start position:0%
to school programming
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
76.5 percent serve local food 73.5
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
percent provide food nutrition or
 
04:50:06.890 --> 04:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
agricultural education 55 percent of
 
04:50:08.690 --> 04:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
those schools have edible Gardens and
 
04:50:10.490 --> 04:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
nearly 50 percent hold student field
 
04:50:12.650 --> 04:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
trips to Farms taste tests and cooking
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
demos I would argue that there is
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
already a robust Farm to school program
 
04:50:21.288 --> 04:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.090 --> 04:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
um I haven't mentioned anything and I
 
04:50:24.410 --> 04:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned every time we come up
 
04:50:26.810 --> 04:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
with a farm what is the definition of
 
04:50:28.670 --> 04:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
local production what is the definition
 
04:50:31.850 --> 04:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
of local food
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
um and you know where I live right in
 
04:50:35.208 --> 04:50:35.218 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut River
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
and four corners Farm is right across
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
the river which has a lot of surplus
 
04:50:43.010 --> 04:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
crops which they provide to
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
um schools they also sell some that have
 
04:50:48.110 --> 04:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
a cheaper rate to Hannaford Brothers
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
um we also have PT Farms which is one of
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
the two slaughterhouses in the state
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
which uh the beef that are slaughtered
 
04:50:59.570 --> 04:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
come from Vermont as well uh is that
 
04:51:01.490 --> 04:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
going to be considered local is that a
 
04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
pro or a product that originates and how
 
04:51:06.050 --> 04:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
do we differentiate between the meat
 
04:51:09.070 --> 04:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's in that uh Farm in their farm
 
04:51:12.410 --> 04:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
store between that and New Hampshire and
 
04:51:14.810 --> 04:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
that of Vermont
 
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and the other concern I have
 
04:51:21.650 --> 04:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
is Echoes what the we have heard from
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture here in
 
04:51:26.090 --> 04:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
marketing foods and marketing is that
 
04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
what is sustainable and and are we small
 
04:51:33.050 --> 04:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
such a small state that we can't sustain
 
04:51:35.090 --> 04:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
and should we have a better definition
 
04:51:38.990 --> 04:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
of what local is is local not just New
 
04:51:42.288 --> 04:51:42.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also Vermont in our our
 
04:51:45.170 --> 04:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
Maine or Massachusetts
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
um and even I've I spoken with the
 
04:51:49.970 --> 04:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
commission over there and for us to
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
truly get involved with something we'd
 
04:51:53.090 --> 04:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
probably have to have a wider scope of
 
04:51:55.368 --> 04:51:55.378 align:start position:0%
region which includes Pennsylvania and
 
04:51:57.050 --> 04:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
New York
 
04:51:59.330 --> 04:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not a farmer and I'm not in
 
04:52:01.250 --> 04:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
that business so I really can't comment
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
too much on it but I am concerned that
 
04:52:06.288 --> 04:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
even when I chaired the select board for
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
years up in Haverhill
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
we gave a local buy or a local right to
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
those towns which abutted us when we
 
04:52:15.890 --> 04:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
were looking for contracted Services
 
04:52:18.288 --> 04:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
we'd give them a first priority before
 
04:52:20.930 --> 04:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
we started looking afar so we could keep
 
04:52:23.390 --> 04:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
employment and by that any town that
 
04:52:24.948 --> 04:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
abutted us on the other side of the
 
04:52:27.650 --> 04:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
river was also considered local
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
so we are our community that um you'll
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
see just as many green plates where I
 
04:52:35.990 --> 04:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
live this will the old man the mountain
 
04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
04:52:38.340 --> 04:52:38.930 align:start position:0%
and and so
um

04:52:38.930 --> 04:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:41.150 --> 04:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
I I have a tough time understanding why
 
04:52:44.330 --> 04:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
we are getting so local that local is
 
04:52:46.368 --> 04:52:46.378 align:start position:0%
only in New Hampshire
 
04:52:46.378 --> 04:52:47.030 align:start position:0%
only in New Hampshire
um

04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
this state is so small that we can't
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're we're a region so I think we've
 
04:52:53.868 --> 04:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
got to expand upon that and get a better
 
04:52:55.610 --> 04:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
definition of and it says right here
 
04:52:58.368 --> 04:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
originate in New Hampshire
 
04:52:58.378 --> 04:52:59.110 align:start position:0%
originate in New Hampshire
um

04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:02.208 --> 04:53:02.218 align:start position:0%
I might take that different ways
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know it where's it where where's it
 
04:53:04.440 --> 04:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
you know it where's it where where's it
packaged

04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
packaged
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
um a lot of our milk goes out and it
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
goes out to the co-ops in the New York
 
04:53:11.330 --> 04:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
State Booth brothers and comes back to
 
04:53:14.330 --> 04:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
us both brothers being owned by Hood
 
04:53:16.850 --> 04:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
so there's much to this that I would
 
04:53:19.128 --> 04:53:19.138 align:start position:0%
like to see some further definition and
 
04:53:20.810 --> 04:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
understanding before I can support
 
04:53:22.850 --> 04:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
something which is not going to really
 
04:53:26.470 --> 04:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
be a benefit to the region I live in
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:34.970 --> 04:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna have to slow down again
 
04:53:36.288 --> 04:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
because we have a member that's
 
04:53:38.030 --> 04:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
testifying upstairs
 
04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
and we just run try and get him
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
so we'll take a short break if you need
 
04:53:46.490 --> 04:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
to get up and walk or stretch please do
 
04:53:46.500 --> 04:54:13.788 align:start position:0%
to get up and walk or stretch please do
so

04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:13.798 --> 04:55:02.890 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:55:02.890 --> 04:55:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.530 --> 04:55:11.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:14.830 --> 04:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:18.708 --> 04:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's too bad that we couldn't get my
 
04:55:20.690 --> 04:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
questions are what is originated
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
solution if it could be defined better
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
in the bill I don't support something
 
04:55:38.170 --> 04:55:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
see so bye
 
04:55:44.690 --> 04:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
good Amendment so maybe if there's a
 
04:55:44.700 --> 04:55:50.530 align:start position:0%
good Amendment so maybe if there's a
minute

04:55:50.530 --> 04:55:50.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:53.570 --> 04:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
I got the USA grant for the local food
 
04:55:56.448 --> 04:55:56.458 align:start position:0%
purchase assistance program their
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
definition of multiple words 400 mile
 
04:56:01.010 --> 04:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
radius applies to this but that's not
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
what this bill says
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
originate in New Hampshire but if they
 
04:56:07.550 --> 04:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
did something with the USDA definition
 
04:56:07.560 --> 04:56:19.368 align:start position:0%
did something with the USDA definition
today

04:56:19.368 --> 04:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:23.090 --> 04:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that would help you can get a
 
04:56:26.110 --> 04:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
couple people to come along I don't know
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't dare you to speak on behalf
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else but it would certainly
 
04:56:33.530 --> 04:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
make a difference yeah if there's any
 
04:56:33.540 --> 04:56:39.730 align:start position:0%
make a difference yeah if there's any
questions

04:56:39.730 --> 04:56:39.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:42.470 --> 04:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
on our side are not owned by New
 
04:56:42.480 --> 04:56:43.990 align:start position:0%
on our side are not owned by New
Hampshire

04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
as long as the farmers get paid and the
 
04:56:52.050 --> 04:56:52.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:52.060 --> 04:57:01.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:57:01.150 --> 04:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's right we have Wendy Rich
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
which is not Ducks apples up well we are
 
04:57:08.690 --> 04:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire side in Haverhill
 
04:57:11.208 --> 04:57:11.218 align:start position:0%
but on the other side is where um most
 
04:57:16.270 --> 04:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:18.530 --> 04:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
why why are you gonna label it just
 
04:57:18.540 --> 04:57:20.628 align:start position:0%
why why are you gonna label it just
perhaps

04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:57:20.638 --> 04:57:41.690 align:start position:0%
perhaps
yeah

04:57:41.690 --> 04:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.700 --> 04:57:44.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:57:44.110 --> 04:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:58:03.070 --> 04:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
according to the USDA and if you made
 
04:58:17.890 --> 04:58:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:23.090 --> 04:58:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:27.050 --> 04:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
so would you have to support
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:33.360 --> 04:59:12.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:59:12.010 --> 04:59:12.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:12.020 --> 04:59:18.190 align:start position:0%
 
our

04:59:18.190 --> 04:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.850 --> 04:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
school is on both sides of the river
 
04:59:26.030 --> 04:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
um and and our buses around it says
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
Haverhill Cooperative on it and then
 
04:59:31.850 --> 04:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
also lists the Vermont schools which and
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
we run the same routes
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
so that we save money we save half a
 
04:59:38.330 --> 04:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually just by sharing
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
Roots yep so it's um
 
04:59:45.230 --> 04:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
I guess that's where I am anybody that
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
tries to that's an old culture we're not
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to change it
 
04:59:52.368 --> 04:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
we're on this side of the state you're
 
04:59:53.208 --> 04:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
on that side of the state where
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
everybody should work together
 
04:59:56.090 --> 04:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
everybody's in one community and I think
 
04:59:58.250 --> 04:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
the USC gets that the community is a
 
04:59:58.260 --> 05:00:06.910 align:start position:0%
the USC gets that the community is a
radius

05:00:06.910 --> 05:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:10.610 --> 05:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
probably the best way to do it is the
 
05:00:15.410 --> 05:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:15.420 --> 05:02:05.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:02:05.330 --> 05:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:07.570 --> 05:02:07.580 align:start position:0%
is itl
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
for HB 445 which is 37 excuse me 47
 
05:02:16.610 --> 05:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me 487 dealing with the farm to
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:22.970 --> 05:02:22.980 align:start position:0%

05:11:16.020 --> 05:11:17.868 align:start position:0%
they are entering the first or second
grade

05:11:17.868 --> 05:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
grade
 
05:11:20.690 --> 05:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
um I think that this
 
05:11:20.700 --> 05:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
um I think that this
um

05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:25.010 --> 05:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
goes against the purpose of the EFA
 
05:11:27.650 --> 05:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
program which is to provide every
 
05:11:31.730 --> 05:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
youngster with the options that they
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
need to succeed and there is no one who
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
knows what the child needs better than
 
05:11:41.810 --> 05:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
the parents so requiring them to go to
 
05:11:44.208 --> 05:11:44.218 align:start position:0%
public school first I think is a
 
05:11:47.890 --> 05:11:47.900 align:start position:0%
handicap and detrimental
 
05:11:50.090 --> 05:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
possibly to the child as well as the
 
05:11:50.100 --> 05:11:51.890 align:start position:0%
possibly to the child as well as the
program

05:11:51.890 --> 05:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:11:56.570 --> 05:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
Belcher then represent leckis and then
 
05:11:59.570 --> 05:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you know in the wake
 
05:12:01.368 --> 05:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
of uh recent Supreme Court precedent
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
that found that it is unconstitutional
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
that if a state is to provide a private
 
05:12:09.050 --> 05:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
school funding through any means that
 
05:12:12.050 --> 05:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
they must also provide that same funding
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
to a student seeking a religious
 
05:12:13.920 --> 05:12:15.470 align:start position:0%
to a student seeking a religious
education

05:12:15.470 --> 05:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:12:18.050 --> 05:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
there will surely be students If This
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
Were to pass that are seeking a
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
religious education while we are
 
05:12:24.650 --> 05:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
separately funding
 
05:12:27.708 --> 05:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
through EFA programs other students who
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
were in non-public schools
 
05:12:33.530 --> 05:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
this would be unconstitutional on its
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
face I believe and as I think we all
 
05:12:38.208 --> 05:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
understand a right delayed is a right
 
05:12:38.218 --> 05:12:39.410 align:start position:0%
understand a right delayed is a right
denied

05:12:39.410 --> 05:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
denied
 
05:12:40.850 --> 05:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:43.788 --> 05:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
represent leckis
 
05:12:46.430 --> 05:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
two comments on this
 
05:12:46.440 --> 05:12:47.330 align:start position:0%
two comments on this
um

05:12:47.330 --> 05:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:49.788 --> 05:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
one this this
 
05:12:51.770 --> 05:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
would force children who had already
 
05:12:55.128 --> 05:12:55.138 align:start position:0%
started out in a public school and found
 
05:12:57.470 --> 05:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
that it just didn't work
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason it may be they just
 
05:13:01.788 --> 05:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't deal with that many people in
 
05:13:03.970 --> 05:13:03.980 align:start position:0%
one place at one time
 
05:13:06.110 --> 05:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
they've already made that decision
 
05:13:09.288 --> 05:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
they've already left and now you're
 
05:13:13.970 --> 05:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
forcing them to go back no no
 
05:13:16.550 --> 05:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
if they're not in the EFA they're not
 
05:13:16.560 --> 05:13:19.730 align:start position:0%
if they're not in the EFA they're not
grandfathered

05:13:19.730 --> 05:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:19.740 --> 05:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
if they're if they're just at home or in
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
a small in a small school and they're
 
05:13:29.930 --> 05:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
not using the EFA but they decide they
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
would like to in order to get that EFA
 
05:13:33.410 --> 05:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
they would have to go back to the public
 
05:13:35.510 --> 05:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
school yeah I mean this is a question
 
05:13:38.330 --> 05:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
about education choice so if they've
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
already made the choice and to to uh to
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
not be in public school and they're not
 
05:13:46.730 --> 05:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
part of the EFA program then that's a
 
05:13:48.170 --> 05:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
choice that they that they've already
 
05:13:52.550 --> 05:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
made this this this bill is simply you
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
know doing what the what the
 
05:13:55.970 --> 05:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education what what do
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
you what do you what he's what he sold
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
um you know the uh the legislature two
 
05:14:03.770 --> 05:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
years ago when when bringing up this
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
program and putting into the budget that
 
05:14:06.000 --> 05:14:06.970 align:start position:0%
program and putting into the budget that
it

05:14:06.970 --> 05:14:06.980 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
provided students and families with a
 
05:14:13.730 --> 05:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
with a choice and uh and so so you know
 
05:14:16.910 --> 05:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
this right now it's it's it's the the
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
program simply stated has turned into a
 
05:14:23.470 --> 05:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
free tuition paid for about public tax
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for people that were already
 
05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
in private schools and not costing
 
05:14:33.170 --> 05:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a dime and um and this you
 
05:14:35.690 --> 05:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
know I I I think had the commissioner
 
05:14:38.810 --> 05:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
actually said that of the um whatever
 
05:14:42.110 --> 05:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
we've got now 3 200 uh students that
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
just about all of them uh were either
 
05:14:46.850 --> 05:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
already in uh public already in private
 
05:14:49.490 --> 05:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
schools or going to attend private
 
05:14:52.128 --> 05:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
schools anyway that that this program
 
05:14:53.868 --> 05:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have gotten any traction at all
 
05:14:56.170 --> 05:14:56.180 align:start position:0%
so it's all part of providing
 
05:14:58.550 --> 05:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
accountability transparency and
 
05:15:01.490 --> 05:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
oversight to the to the program putting
 
05:15:03.410 --> 05:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
on some guard rails that that that
 
05:15:07.610 --> 05:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
protect uh uh the taxpayer and live up
 
05:15:10.128 --> 05:15:10.138 align:start position:0%
to you know what the what the what the
 
05:15:11.690 --> 05:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner said when the program was
 
05:15:15.050 --> 05:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
established and um and in fact I think I
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned it during the hearing that the
 
05:15:20.090 --> 05:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
the exact language that's in here was
 
05:15:22.850 --> 05:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
taken from an amendment to Senate Bill
 
05:15:26.750 --> 05:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
193 back in 2018 yeah absolute same
 
05:15:29.990 --> 05:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
subject offered by Representatives lad
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
wolf and cordelli so so there's nothing
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
there's nothing new here uh other than
 
05:15:39.288 --> 05:15:39.298 align:start position:0%
um than looking to looking to protect
 
05:15:41.868 --> 05:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of of a program that
 
05:15:44.690 --> 05:15:44.700 align:start position:0%
provides choice for students and not
 
05:15:44.700 --> 05:15:45.410 align:start position:0%
provides choice for students and not
just

05:15:45.410 --> 05:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:15:47.570 --> 05:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
um you know free tuition on taxpayer
 
05:15:50.288 --> 05:15:50.298 align:start position:0%
dimes may I continue
 
05:15:52.670 --> 05:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
yeah there was a question so he
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
responded to the question representative
 
05:15:59.270 --> 05:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.730 --> 05:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
and it was it wasn't meant to be a
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
question except that you said I was
 
05:16:05.330 --> 05:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
wrong and I was making sure that I was
 
05:16:07.670 --> 05:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
reading the bill correctly
 
05:16:07.680 --> 05:16:09.250 align:start position:0%
reading the bill correctly
um

05:16:09.250 --> 05:16:09.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:12.948 --> 05:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
I don't see how this in response I don't
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
see how this gives any more transparency
 
05:16:18.530 --> 05:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
or anything saying a child has to go to
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
a public school but
 
05:16:24.410 --> 05:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
my point was this was tried in other
 
05:16:28.368 --> 05:16:28.378 align:start position:0%
states when somebody objected to a new
 
05:16:30.350 --> 05:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
program I believe it was actually a
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
charter school program and well it's
 
05:16:34.610 --> 05:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
been tried multiple times so it was
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
various different programs when they
 
05:16:39.288 --> 05:16:39.298 align:start position:0%
tried the
 
05:16:41.330 --> 05:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
um you have to go to a public school for
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
a year first
 
05:16:44.750 --> 05:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
all these kids
 
05:16:47.570 --> 05:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
suddenly signed up for public schools it
 
05:16:49.850 --> 05:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
was a disaster they signed up for the
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
public schools the public schools
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
weren't ready for all these kids they
 
05:16:55.070 --> 05:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
signed up right at the last moment they
 
05:16:58.430 --> 05:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:01.970 --> 05:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
it the schools then the states that did
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
this or the towns that did this
 
05:17:07.250 --> 05:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
got rid of those laws because it proved
 
05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
to be a disaster for the communities and
 
05:17:13.788 --> 05:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
the local schools and it either for this
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
or in one case it was just to get books
 
05:17:19.368 --> 05:17:19.378 align:start position:0%
he had to go to the public school to get
 
05:17:22.430 --> 05:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
the books and so an entire this was in
 
05:17:24.590 --> 05:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
Chicago an entire
 
05:17:24.600 --> 05:17:25.970 align:start position:0%
Chicago an entire
um

05:17:25.970 --> 05:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
all the people going to religious
 
05:17:31.490 --> 05:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
schools all signed up to get books it's
 
05:17:33.410 --> 05:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
just it's been tried and it's a mess
 
05:17:36.650 --> 05:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
number one and number two I don't
 
05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
understand the least bit how going to a
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
public school gives any transparency
 
05:17:44.448 --> 05:17:44.458 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to the program what it has to
 
05:17:46.490 --> 05:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
do with the program
 
05:17:49.730 --> 05:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's I mean what what can we see because
 
05:17:52.128 --> 05:17:52.138 align:start position:0%
a kid went to a public school for a year
 
05:17:54.530 --> 05:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
or guide rails or any of the other
 
05:17:56.090 --> 05:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
things you said I don't see how this
 
05:17:58.190 --> 05:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
does any any of that
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
smile you had your hand up and then
 
05:18:03.650 --> 05:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
represented right thank you very much
 
05:18:03.660 --> 05:18:04.490 align:start position:0%
represented right thank you very much
um

05:18:04.490 --> 05:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:07.970 --> 05:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
this is the first of a series of bills
 
05:18:11.410 --> 05:18:11.420 align:start position:0%
that are coming before us on your face
 
05:18:13.850 --> 05:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
this legislature has not had an
 
05:18:15.770 --> 05:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to debate
 
05:18:18.288 --> 05:18:18.298 align:start position:0%
the issue of efa's
 
05:18:20.330 --> 05:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
we recall that this program is put into
 
05:18:22.128 --> 05:18:22.138 align:start position:0%
the back of the budget
 
05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
did not have a full disclosure as a
 
05:18:27.288 --> 05:18:27.298 align:start position:0%
matter of fact we've had conversations
 
05:18:30.110 --> 05:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
about this earlier in other sessions and
 
05:18:31.970 --> 05:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
this committee basically tabled the
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
motion because of the questions that we
 
05:18:33.718 --> 05:18:35.390 align:start position:0%
motion because of the questions that we
had

05:18:35.390 --> 05:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
now we had an opportunity here the
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
numbers are close we all know that we've
 
05:18:42.650 --> 05:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
all been said by our respective
 
05:18:45.530 --> 05:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
leadership yeah best show up because we
 
05:18:47.628 --> 05:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to happen
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
so we had an opportunity here
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
to put a repeal of this bill in
 
05:18:59.090 --> 05:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
we chose not to do that
 
05:19:02.270 --> 05:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
what we chose to do is to try to provide
 
05:19:04.730 --> 05:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
as representative Lynnwood said some
 
05:19:07.610 --> 05:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
guide rails for this program
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
so that whatever it is it can be
 
05:19:09.480 --> 05:19:10.670 align:start position:0%
so that whatever it is it can be
effective

05:19:10.670 --> 05:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
effective
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
we recognize that there are students who
 
05:19:14.990 --> 05:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
are benefiting from the program
 
05:19:17.390 --> 05:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
but right now there is no oversight to
 
05:19:19.490 --> 05:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
the damn program
 
05:19:21.890 --> 05:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
there is no oversight for taxpayer
 
05:19:25.490 --> 05:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
monies that are going into this program
 
05:19:27.410 --> 05:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
all we are trying to do through this
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
series of issues
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
is to provide some sense of rational
 
05:19:32.520 --> 05:19:34.190 align:start position:0%
is to provide some sense of rational
oversight

05:19:34.190 --> 05:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
05:19:37.850 --> 05:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
and some Focus for the program
 
05:19:39.890 --> 05:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
this is just one of several that are
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to become before us
 
05:19:43.550 --> 05:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
and we will have this debate on the
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
floor obviously but I wanted the
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee just to know that we've made
 
05:19:50.690 --> 05:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
the decision to try to provide these
 
05:19:52.430 --> 05:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
guide rails for the program rather than
 
05:19:54.050 --> 05:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
trying to repeal the program because
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
frankly we might be able to be
 
05:19:57.770 --> 05:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
successful if the right numbers are
 
05:20:01.730 --> 05:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
there we chose not to do that
 
05:20:04.730 --> 05:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
so as these bills come before you I
 
05:20:06.288 --> 05:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
would hope we would be able to have the
 
05:20:06.298 --> 05:20:07.190 align:start position:0%
would hope we would be able to have the
debate

05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
debate
 
05:20:10.010 --> 05:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had in the past
 
05:20:12.890 --> 05:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
to really flush this out to see how we
 
05:20:14.390 --> 05:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
can make sure that there are at least
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
some sense of oversight some sense of
 
05:20:20.330 --> 05:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
rational approach to this particular
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
program thank you Mr chair you're
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
welcome representative dry thank you Mr
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
05:20:29.810 --> 05:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
in the course of my homeschooling career
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
I helped a lot of families make a
 
05:20:34.490 --> 05:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
transition to homeschooling whether
 
05:20:35.868 --> 05:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
they've moved from out of state or
 
05:20:37.128 --> 05:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
whether they are involved in public
 
05:20:37.138 --> 05:20:38.350 align:start position:0%
whether they are involved in public
schools

05:20:38.350 --> 05:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:20:41.750 --> 05:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
Christmas vacation is a really nice time
 
05:20:44.810 --> 05:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
if you're going to change direction to
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
stop and and pick up in the new year at
 
05:20:50.570 --> 05:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
a different direction the homeschooling
 
05:20:52.670 --> 05:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
laws in New Hampshire make it easy to do
 
05:20:55.550 --> 05:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
that and the families that arrive at
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
that decision are making a
 
05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
a smoother break and change of direction
 
05:21:06.350 --> 05:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
as they possibly can I wonder how making
 
05:21:08.570 --> 05:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
a student like that makes a student
 
05:21:10.310 --> 05:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
who's made that decision stay for
 
05:21:12.590 --> 05:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
another half of a year is helpful to
 
05:21:15.948 --> 05:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:21:19.850 --> 05:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you excuse me
 
05:21:23.448 --> 05:21:23.458 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead and then we'll
 
05:21:24.830 --> 05:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:24.840 --> 05:21:26.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:21:26.090 --> 05:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:29.470 --> 05:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
I'm also wondering about a student who
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
moves from Maine or Vermont where they
 
05:21:37.128 --> 05:21:37.138 align:start position:0%
have choice they have the oldest town
 
05:21:40.070 --> 05:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
oldest forms of choice Town tuitioning
 
05:21:42.770 --> 05:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
programs in both States in one case
 
05:21:45.470 --> 05:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
dating back to the 1800s
 
05:21:45.480 --> 05:21:46.128 align:start position:0%
dating back to the 1800s
um

05:21:46.128 --> 05:21:46.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:49.368 --> 05:21:49.378 align:start position:0%
we would be forcing that child coming to
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to spend at least one year
 
05:21:55.610 --> 05:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
in a public school
 
05:21:58.368 --> 05:21:58.378 align:start position:0%
where they might be moving
 
05:22:01.610 --> 05:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
um just across the border to go to a
 
05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
private school of some sort in New
 
05:22:03.840 --> 05:22:05.270 align:start position:0%
private school of some sort in New
Hampshire

05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:22:07.310 --> 05:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's unfair to that
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
child and
 
05:22:09.360 --> 05:22:10.310 align:start position:0%
child and
um

05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:12.650 --> 05:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure in the bill what is meant
 
05:22:15.050 --> 05:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
by who's currently attending
 
05:22:18.350 --> 05:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
for a minimum of one year
 
05:22:21.170 --> 05:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what that means so
 
05:22:24.288 --> 05:22:24.298 align:start position:0%
um uh do you spend one year
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
and what happens after that one year
 
05:22:28.368 --> 05:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
because you're not currently attending
 
05:22:28.378 --> 05:22:30.590 align:start position:0%
because you're not currently attending
anymore

05:22:30.590 --> 05:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:22:32.810 --> 05:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
um but I think my main point is for
 
05:22:35.448 --> 05:22:35.458 align:start position:0%
those children moving from Maine or
 
05:22:38.448 --> 05:22:38.458 align:start position:0%
Vermont or any other state that has a
 
05:22:42.050 --> 05:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
choice program I don't think we're being
 
05:22:45.170 --> 05:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
fair to those families and it might even
 
05:22:47.930 --> 05:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
discourage families from moving to New
 
05:22:47.940 --> 05:22:49.868 align:start position:0%
discourage families from moving to New
Hampshire

05:22:49.868 --> 05:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:22:51.890 --> 05:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
05:22:53.690 --> 05:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
hey channel that
 
05:22:55.010 --> 05:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I have to disagree with
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
representatively I don't really give it
 
05:22:57.470 --> 05:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
to him while people come from Maine
 
05:22:59.570 --> 05:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
Vermont I'm concerned about the kids we
 
05:23:02.090 --> 05:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
have here you said when you open up
 
05:23:04.610 --> 05:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
Glenn this is an off to the need to
 
05:23:07.368 --> 05:23:07.378 align:start position:0%
succeed there's a handicap
 
05:23:09.050 --> 05:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
um this bill was this bill was
 
05:23:12.650 --> 05:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
predicated as a low income option for
 
05:23:15.288 --> 05:23:15.298 align:start position:0%
kids it didn't get the same break uh and
 
05:23:17.090 --> 05:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
as we know that's not what we had we had
 
05:23:18.650 --> 05:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
eight percent of the kids in the initial
 
05:23:21.170 --> 05:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
year of the program never ever attended
 
05:23:23.448 --> 05:23:23.458 align:start position:0%
a public school they were already in
 
05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
private schools so this is a tuition
 
05:23:27.890 --> 05:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
piece for private schools
 
05:23:30.708 --> 05:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
my concern is that
 
05:23:33.708 --> 05:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
it's not an option to determine how the
 
05:23:35.208 --> 05:23:35.218 align:start position:0%
parents are going to succeed if they've
 
05:23:38.270 --> 05:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
never tried Public School
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
they've never tried public school so how
 
05:23:41.570 --> 05:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
do you know is an option is not going to
 
05:23:41.580 --> 05:23:42.350 align:start position:0%
do you know is an option is not going to
work

05:23:42.350 --> 05:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:23:43.490 --> 05:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
because they hear it about from their
 
05:23:45.530 --> 05:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
neighbor or something else no so this is
 
05:23:47.448 --> 05:23:47.458 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't even come close to me or
 
05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be doing in terms of
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
that I think this this allows and this
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you if to follow there's a better
 
05:23:55.610 --> 05:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
option let them try public school if it
 
05:23:57.410 --> 05:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't work then fine they have an
 
05:23:59.390 --> 05:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
option that's the least they can do this
 
05:24:01.128 --> 05:24:01.138 align:start position:0%
is public school
 
05:24:07.690 --> 05:24:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned about students who
 
05:24:11.810 --> 05:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
may have been going to
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
private school
 
05:24:18.110 --> 05:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know for years and then uh because
 
05:24:19.788 --> 05:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
of financial hardship in their family
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps the parent loses a job or
 
05:24:23.810 --> 05:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
there's just medical who knows financial
 
05:24:27.490 --> 05:24:27.500 align:start position:0%
hardship then uh
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
they must
 
05:24:32.448 --> 05:24:32.458 align:start position:0%
go to the public school then they can't
 
05:24:34.970 --> 05:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
they don't have a choice so I just
 
05:24:36.530 --> 05:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that up because that can
 
05:24:38.750 --> 05:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
happen so I don't think it's fair to
 
05:24:38.760 --> 05:24:41.208 align:start position:0%
happen so I don't think it's fair to
them

05:24:41.208 --> 05:24:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:43.788 --> 05:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to ask one thing you know I
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to get into this
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
what about a child that's
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
um currently in a DFA program and
 
05:24:51.650 --> 05:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
there's another youngster coming along
 
05:24:53.690 --> 05:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
in the family and now we have this in
 
05:24:53.700 --> 05:24:54.530 align:start position:0%
in the family and now we have this in
place

05:24:54.530 --> 05:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:24:57.650 --> 05:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
could they both receive vfas or would
 
05:24:59.628 --> 05:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
one have to you know one continue with
 
05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
the EFA and the other be forced to go
 
05:25:03.830 --> 05:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
attend kindergarten or first grade for
 
05:25:06.230 --> 05:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
the time that's necessary before they
 
05:25:08.930 --> 05:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
could get an EFA that will make it very
 
05:25:11.930 --> 05:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
it's a real hardship on a family so so I
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
can answer that um for you Mr chair so
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
there is an exception in here
 
05:25:20.390 --> 05:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
um or who is entering kindergarten or
 
05:25:24.590 --> 05:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
first grade so so if um if you're a
 
05:25:28.730 --> 05:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
student whose older sibling uh is an EFA
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
student and now the younger sibling is
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
entering kindergarten or first grade
 
05:25:37.310 --> 05:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
that would qualify them to um uh to have
 
05:25:39.490 --> 05:25:39.500 align:start position:0%
a education Freedom account
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
see I've been having a hard time reading
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
and really trying to figure out what
 
05:25:46.368 --> 05:25:46.378 align:start position:0%
this this sentence says yeah so so again
 
05:25:49.128 --> 05:25:49.138 align:start position:0%
you know this this neither your words
 
05:25:51.170 --> 05:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative lad from an amendment
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
well I think that's called several ways
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's a lot younger back so so the the
 
05:26:01.970 --> 05:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
way the way the way I parse this as the
 
05:26:04.430 --> 05:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor of it
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
um so uh uh established for an eligible
 
05:26:10.490 --> 05:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
student who is currently attending a New
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public School including
 
05:26:13.490 --> 05:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School for a minimum of
 
05:26:16.730 --> 05:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
one year that's one portion of it Orr
 
05:26:18.650 --> 05:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
who is entering kindergarten or first
 
05:26:18.660 --> 05:26:19.430 align:start position:0%
who is entering kindergarten or first
grade

05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
grade
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
so that's an eligible student
 
05:26:24.288 --> 05:26:24.298 align:start position:0%
who is entering kindergarten or first
 
05:26:24.298 --> 05:26:29.050 align:start position:0%
who is entering kindergarten or first
grade

05:26:29.050 --> 05:26:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:31.510 --> 05:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:33.890 --> 05:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative uh cardelli in the uf10
 
05:26:35.810 --> 05:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you
 
05:26:39.288 --> 05:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
um unlike uh previous uh speaker
 
05:26:40.910 --> 05:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
um I care about the kids in New
 
05:26:43.610 --> 05:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I also care about the kids
 
05:26:46.490 --> 05:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
and the families who want to come here I
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
care about them also it's not one of the
 
05:26:51.770 --> 05:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
other for me I care about them all
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
05:26:55.970 --> 05:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and I appreciate
 
05:26:58.250 --> 05:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
that clarification from representative
 
05:27:01.610 --> 05:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
luno because it it brings me to an
 
05:27:04.910 --> 05:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
oddity within this bill the idea that
 
05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
we're going to force a student accept
 
05:27:11.990 --> 05:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
those who are entering at kindergarten
 
05:27:14.650 --> 05:27:14.660 align:start position:0%
or first grade to stay for a year
 
05:27:17.208 --> 05:27:17.218 align:start position:0%
strongly suggest this bill is tailored
 
05:27:19.250 --> 05:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
toward those who have already been in
 
05:27:22.788 --> 05:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:25.868 --> 05:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
am I wrong in that if if those
 
05:27:28.010 --> 05:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and first graders or yeah I
 
05:27:29.090 --> 05:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
mean I think that's what the
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education said is that
 
05:27:33.530 --> 05:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
this gives students who are who are
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
already in public school an option to um
 
05:27:38.690 --> 05:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
to go to private school to Home School
 
05:27:41.570 --> 05:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
do uh do some other option but as we've
 
05:27:44.448 --> 05:27:44.458 align:start position:0%
as we've found out it appears that only
 
05:27:44.458 --> 05:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
as we've found out it appears that only
about

05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:27:48.350 --> 05:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
um 60 students a year
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
um have um have you know have actually
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know made the made the choice based
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
on having a voucher to exit their Public
 
05:27:57.360 --> 05:27:58.550 align:start position:0%
on having a voucher to exit their Public
School

05:27:58.550 --> 05:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
School
 
05:28:01.250 --> 05:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
take a voucher and and do another option
 
05:28:04.910 --> 05:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else everybody else was either
 
05:28:06.770 --> 05:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
already in a private school or home
 
05:28:08.690 --> 05:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
school or going to go to private home
 
05:28:10.730 --> 05:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
school private school or home school
 
05:28:13.010 --> 05:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
anyway you can take a look at the
 
05:28:16.910 --> 05:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
Department's own census data on um on
 
05:28:19.368 --> 05:28:19.378 align:start position:0%
homeschooling on private schooling those
 
05:28:21.530 --> 05:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
numbers aren't going up
 
05:28:25.430 --> 05:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so so the the 3200 kids the private
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
school and home school numbers didn't go
 
05:28:30.530 --> 05:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
up by 3 200. these kids were already in
 
05:28:33.770 --> 05:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
or going to go uh anyway and so this is
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
this has simply been
 
05:28:38.690 --> 05:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
um uh coming on I think 25 million
 
05:28:42.350 --> 05:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
dollars of of of of taxpayer money to
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
pay private school tuition bill or
 
05:28:46.670 --> 05:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
homeschool costs for these kids and
 
05:28:48.650 --> 05:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
another request that 60 million coming
 
05:28:50.570 --> 05:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
down the pike in the in the current
 
05:28:53.570 --> 05:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
budget right now it's not moving kids
 
05:28:56.208 --> 05:28:56.218 align:start position:0%
out of um out of out of public school
 
05:28:58.490 --> 05:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
which isn't it which is exactly the
 
05:28:58.500 --> 05:29:00.010 align:start position:0%
which isn't it which is exactly the
intent

05:29:00.010 --> 05:29:00.020 align:start position:0%
intent
 
05:29:02.448 --> 05:29:02.458 align:start position:0%
as it was presented by the commissioner
 
05:29:05.810 --> 05:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
of this program to begin with so this
 
05:29:08.990 --> 05:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
this simply puts the program back on the
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
tracks that it was supposed to be on
 
05:29:14.208 --> 05:29:14.218 align:start position:0%
sir follow-up yes please just to clarify
 
05:29:15.590 --> 05:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
then and thank you for that
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
clarification so to be clear the the
 
05:29:20.090 --> 05:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
point of the program is that students
 
05:29:22.430 --> 05:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
who are already in public school and who
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
have done okay in public school
 
05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
seemingly because they've stayed there
 
05:29:26.510 --> 05:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
for a while they're the ones who would
 
05:29:27.890 --> 05:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
be allowed to leave who are probably the
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
most unlikely to leave but those who
 
05:29:32.448 --> 05:29:32.458 align:start position:0%
have already left because they probably
 
05:29:35.150 --> 05:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
may have had problems those are the ones
 
05:29:36.530 --> 05:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
who would have to go back for a year
 
05:29:38.170 --> 05:29:38.180 align:start position:0%
that's that was the point I was making
 
05:29:40.970 --> 05:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
then left though the point Mike
 
05:29:42.530 --> 05:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
they hadn't left they've never been
 
05:29:43.970 --> 05:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
there that was a point
 
05:29:45.708 --> 05:29:45.718 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of the kid never been
 
05:29:45.718 --> 05:29:47.330 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of the kid never been
there

05:29:47.330 --> 05:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:29:49.368 --> 05:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
represent Lucas you had your end up or
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
did you not yeah
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
I did and it was for a couple of things
 
05:29:57.110 --> 05:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to follow the logic
 
05:29:57.120 --> 05:29:57.788 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to follow the logic
yeah

05:29:57.788 --> 05:29:57.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:30:00.650 --> 05:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
if they're only the people who can go
 
05:30:05.090 --> 05:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
who can have this Choice are those who
 
05:30:07.310 --> 05:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
are already in public school unless you
 
05:30:10.128 --> 05:30:10.138 align:start position:0%
haven't been to public school yet
 
05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
I mean what is the I don't understand
 
05:30:14.810 --> 05:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
that logic if you want them to have
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
experienced Public School
 
05:30:18.650 --> 05:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
why do they have a choice if they're
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
entering kindergarten or first grade
 
05:30:22.910 --> 05:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
they haven't experienced Public School
 
05:30:26.208 --> 05:30:26.218 align:start position:0%
I I don't it's completely illogical to
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
me can you explain the logic because I'm
 
05:30:32.208 --> 05:30:32.218 align:start position:0%
not understanding you say one thing
 
05:30:33.948 --> 05:30:33.958 align:start position:0%
you want them attending the public
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
school and or leaving
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
only give the choice to those who will
 
05:30:39.850 --> 05:30:39.860 align:start position:0%
be leaving the public school but then
 
05:30:42.590 --> 05:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
you say but if they haven't been to the
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
public school yet they get a choice
 
05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
so thanks thanks for the question
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it's I think it's
 
05:30:52.550 --> 05:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
pretty simple uh that the that the bill
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
is providing choice to students and
 
05:30:58.250 --> 05:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
families as their students uh are are
 
05:31:01.670 --> 05:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know come of age to go into a
 
05:31:03.890 --> 05:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or first grade they can
 
05:31:06.410 --> 05:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
they can sign up for it for in for an
 
05:31:08.930 --> 05:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
EFA or if they're already in second
 
05:31:10.788 --> 05:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
third or fourth grade or fifth grade or
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
tenth grade and say hey you know what
 
05:31:16.550 --> 05:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
um uh uh or actually let me pick uh let
 
05:31:18.410 --> 05:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
me pick eighth grade because a lot of
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
you know I think I have to look at the
 
05:31:20.638 --> 05:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
you know I think I have to look at the
the

05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:25.190 --> 05:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
um the yearly Census Data from the from
 
05:31:27.970 --> 05:31:27.980 align:start position:0%
the department but but you know
 
05:31:30.230 --> 05:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
attending public eighth grade and then
 
05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
private school for for high school
 
05:31:34.490 --> 05:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's an option that uh that many
 
05:31:34.500 --> 05:31:35.930 align:start position:0%
that's an option that uh that many
students

05:31:35.930 --> 05:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:31:38.208 --> 05:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
um not a huge number but many students
 
05:31:40.910 --> 05:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire take so you may find
 
05:31:44.570 --> 05:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
that a student has um has gone K-8 in
 
05:31:46.190 --> 05:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
public school cool and then it's like
 
05:31:48.170 --> 05:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
hey you know what the the voucher
 
05:31:51.050 --> 05:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
program the fa program provides me with
 
05:31:53.690 --> 05:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
with funds that that help me bridge the
 
05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
gap to uh to attend private school for
 
05:31:59.990 --> 05:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
high school and so so I I I'm I'm not
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
quite sure I I understand what your what
 
05:32:05.690 --> 05:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
Your what your concern is with this
 
05:32:08.750 --> 05:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
other than as as it you know might
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
relate to uh kids that have have you
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
know families that have already made the
 
05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
choice to enter a non to go to a
 
05:32:18.350 --> 05:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
non-public school which wasn't the
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
intent of the uh the program that was
 
05:32:24.250 --> 05:32:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.510 --> 05:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:31.070 --> 05:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the numbers it's
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
actually 40 something percent who were
 
05:32:35.810 --> 05:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
at some point in a public school and
 
05:32:37.910 --> 05:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
then are not now in a public school the
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
20 is just of the start of the year of
 
05:32:43.310 --> 05:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
the start of the program
 
05:32:43.320 --> 05:32:44.030 align:start position:0%
the start of the program
um

05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:46.368 --> 05:32:46.378 align:start position:0%
a number left during covet a number left
 
05:32:50.208 --> 05:32:50.218 align:start position:0%
before that and what I want to know what
 
05:32:52.610 --> 05:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
so you're
 
05:32:54.650 --> 05:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that what you're saying
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
is that a student for whom Public School
 
05:33:00.470 --> 05:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
really was not working out to the point
 
05:33:02.330 --> 05:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
that the parent felt that they needed to
 
05:33:04.250 --> 05:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
withdraw the student
 
05:33:06.948 --> 05:33:06.958 align:start position:0%
but the parent is now struggling to
 
05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
provide home education
 
05:33:11.270 --> 05:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
to pay for the things that the student
 
05:33:11.280 --> 05:33:13.070 align:start position:0%
to pay for the things that the student
needs

05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
is struggling but they still would
 
05:33:19.128 --> 05:33:19.138 align:start position:0%
prefer to struggle then send the child
 
05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
back to the public school we're saying
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
because you took your child out of
 
05:33:26.448 --> 05:33:26.458 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:33:29.570 --> 05:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
before the EFA program started you now
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
can't qualify for the EFA program so you
 
05:33:34.368 --> 05:33:34.378 align:start position:0%
have to keep going on and struggling
 
05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
because you made that choice before the
 
05:33:42.230 --> 05:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay I I sure yeah I'm just not aware of
 
05:33:47.330 --> 05:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
any comments made by the commissioner of
 
05:33:51.110 --> 05:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
Education uh when uh when when uh
 
05:33:53.570 --> 05:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
selling the EFA program that that's what
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's who it was designed for I don't
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
recall a single comment from the
 
05:33:58.850 --> 05:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner to that effect I I have a
 
05:34:00.230 --> 05:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
question with line three in the bill
 
05:34:01.610 --> 05:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
right now too
 
05:34:01.620 --> 05:34:02.270 align:start position:0%
right now too
um

05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:04.250 --> 05:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
who is currently attending a New
 
05:34:06.890 --> 05:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public School
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
we have New Hampshire students going to
 
05:34:14.930 --> 05:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
public schools in Vermont
 
05:34:16.850 --> 05:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
which are approved
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education here
 
05:34:19.680 --> 05:34:21.230 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education here
and

05:34:21.230 --> 05:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:34:23.810 --> 05:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
it's the only choice they currently have
 
05:34:25.970 --> 05:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
in the district they're being sent from
 
05:34:29.150 --> 05:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about Monroe sending all the
 
05:34:31.970 --> 05:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
kids to St Johnsbury Academy for high
 
05:34:34.128 --> 05:34:34.138 align:start position:0%
school a student goes there and says
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
that I don't like this I want to have an
 
05:34:35.878 --> 05:34:37.250 align:start position:0%
that I don't like this I want to have an
EFA

05:34:37.250 --> 05:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
EFA
 
05:34:39.170 --> 05:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
can they do it
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
so so that that's a great question I
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
think you know we've gotta we've gotta
 
05:34:45.170 --> 05:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
go back to the fact that you know the
 
05:34:47.810 --> 05:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
statutes are sort of at the 30 000 foot
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
level and rules are at the at the ground
 
05:34:53.810 --> 05:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
level and um uh 194 F does give the
 
05:34:55.310 --> 05:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education rule making
 
05:34:58.250 --> 05:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
Authority uh surrounding the program so
 
05:35:01.490 --> 05:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
I think um I think you know in rules uh
 
05:35:04.610 --> 05:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
with respect to applications to the EFA
 
05:35:07.010 --> 05:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
program they could certainly um I think
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
within the within the spirit of this of
 
05:35:12.530 --> 05:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
of this section uh include public
 
05:35:16.490 --> 05:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
schools that are approved by um uh by
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
the by the Department of Education and
 
05:35:21.770 --> 05:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
that that would certainly include
 
05:35:24.110 --> 05:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
um uh schools that may be operated in
 
05:35:26.448 --> 05:35:26.458 align:start position:0%
other states but but considered to be
 
05:35:29.448 --> 05:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know public schools
 
05:35:31.128 --> 05:35:31.138 align:start position:0%
for New New Hampshire Public School
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
students I think that falls within rule
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
making the rule-making realm
 
05:35:38.570 --> 05:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
um uh because they you know it is sort
 
05:35:41.090 --> 05:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
of a
 
05:35:43.510 --> 05:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know sort of an edge case
 
05:35:47.270 --> 05:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
here but a valid one Mr chair and and I
 
05:35:49.250 --> 05:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
think I think that would fall into rules
 
05:35:51.230 --> 05:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
and then I would go one step further and
 
05:35:52.670 --> 05:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
say okay we're talking about New
 
05:35:54.830 --> 05:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public School yeah we're
 
05:35:56.208 --> 05:35:56.218 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
An approved School
 
05:36:01.250 --> 05:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
but we also have private schools that
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
are approved by Doe as well
 
05:36:06.970 --> 05:36:06.980 align:start position:0%
so should we be saying a New Hampshire
 
05:36:11.810 --> 05:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
approved public or private school
 
05:36:14.570 --> 05:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
so thanks I don't think I don't think I
 
05:36:16.190 --> 05:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
mean there's obviously a number of
 
05:36:19.850 --> 05:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
students who are attaching attending New
 
05:36:22.730 --> 05:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public and private schools and
 
05:36:25.730 --> 05:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
and I think the the intent behind this
 
05:36:28.368 --> 05:36:28.378 align:start position:0%
bill is that is that these are public
 
05:36:31.788 --> 05:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
school students who uh whose families
 
05:36:33.590 --> 05:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
who whose students and their families
 
05:36:35.690 --> 05:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
would like to have a um they're
 
05:36:37.368 --> 05:36:37.378 align:start position:0%
attending public schools and they'd like
 
05:36:39.650 --> 05:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
to have a choice to do uh to do
 
05:36:41.448 --> 05:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
something else and they meet the the
 
05:36:46.128 --> 05:36:46.138 align:start position:0%
income eligibility uh guidelines uh uh
 
05:36:49.970 --> 05:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
income eligibility standards as well uh
 
05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
so uh so you know if the student is
 
05:36:53.810 --> 05:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
currently attending
 
05:36:56.330 --> 05:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
private school in New Hampshire I I I I
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's what the that's not
 
05:37:00.770 --> 05:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner was talking about
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's what the tax base
 
05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stop a little bit more
 
05:37:05.690 --> 05:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
under our tuition program that we we
 
05:37:09.650 --> 05:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
passed the the receiving school that's
 
05:37:11.090 --> 05:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
being sent from a district which is
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
tuitioning is approved not by the doe
 
05:37:15.470 --> 05:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's approved by the local Board of
 
05:37:19.368 --> 05:37:19.378 align:start position:0%
Education as you know so I I believe
 
05:37:22.368 --> 05:37:22.378 align:start position:0%
that there there to read this properly
 
05:37:24.050 --> 05:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
it really needs say a New Hampshire
 
05:37:26.930 --> 05:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
approved public or private school if
 
05:37:29.390 --> 05:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to enable the student that's
 
05:37:33.708 --> 05:37:33.718 align:start position:0%
coming from a tuition District such as a
 
05:37:33.718 --> 05:37:34.670 align:start position:0%
coming from a tuition District such as a
pyrmont

05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
pyrmont
 
05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
that does all their tuitioning of kids
 
05:37:39.288 --> 05:37:39.298 align:start position:0%
outside now and that's a many many
 
05:37:42.530 --> 05:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
districts in the state do that except
 
05:37:44.090 --> 05:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the
 
05:37:47.208 --> 05:37:47.218 align:start position:0%
bill by by saying that there if they're
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
already attending a private school then
 
05:37:52.430 --> 05:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
they can apply for a uh an EFA well
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
maybe they're upset with that private
 
05:37:56.208 --> 05:37:56.218 align:start position:0%
school and they said no I'm just not
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
ready to go in EFA program it's going to
 
05:38:00.410 --> 05:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
fit what's going on with our family and
 
05:38:03.530 --> 05:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's a better fit so
 
05:38:06.530 --> 05:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
I see it seems to me we're saying it's
 
05:38:08.510 --> 05:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay to do it if it's a public but for
 
05:38:10.970 --> 05:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
the private it's yeah and I think that's
 
05:38:14.570 --> 05:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
discriminatory yeah I I mean I I I think
 
05:38:17.090 --> 05:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
so long as as long as the private school
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't a
 
05:38:22.730 --> 05:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
um a private that the that the choice
 
05:38:24.770 --> 05:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
the family had made to go to a private
 
05:38:27.350 --> 05:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
school was
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
um was a district Choice as opposed to I
 
05:38:33.410 --> 05:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
mean we're really sort of getting Beyond
 
05:38:36.288 --> 05:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
I think what what you can how you can
 
05:38:40.010 --> 05:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
carve out every possible
 
05:38:44.810 --> 05:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
you know permutation in in in statute
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I think you're I think
 
05:38:49.330 --> 05:38:49.340 align:start position:0%
um Rick you're probably talking about
 
05:38:52.970 --> 05:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
about a public school district that uses
 
05:38:55.250 --> 05:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
a private school for I'm talking about
 
05:38:57.170 --> 05:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
the tuition program which we have yeah
 
05:38:59.810 --> 05:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's a public separate
 
05:39:01.610 --> 05:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
Academy in Vermont or St Johnsbury
 
05:39:03.650 --> 05:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
Academy or but it's done those are
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
independent but it's done through the
 
05:39:07.788 --> 05:39:07.798 align:start position:0%
public school district to meet to meet
 
05:39:09.610 --> 05:39:09.620 align:start position:0%
the school
 
05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
proof approved by the local board yes
 
05:39:14.410 --> 05:39:14.420 align:start position:0%
and it's locally approved rather than
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
approved private or public school in New
 
05:39:18.770 --> 05:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's locally approved right
 
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's locally approved but that Public
 
05:39:22.190 --> 05:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
School District even though they're
 
05:39:24.110 --> 05:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
getting the the receiving Services
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
through through a private school has to
 
05:39:28.970 --> 05:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
comply with all of the public school
 
05:39:28.980 --> 05:39:29.868 align:start position:0%
comply with all of the public school
um

05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:32.650 --> 05:39:32.660 align:start position:0%
um uh regulations both state and federal
 
05:39:35.930 --> 05:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh they so they're they're they're not
 
05:39:39.530 --> 05:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
able to operate as as a private school
 
05:39:39.540 --> 05:39:40.550 align:start position:0%
able to operate as as a private school
that

05:39:40.550 --> 05:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:39:44.090 --> 05:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know does not have a yeah outside of
 
05:39:46.970 --> 05:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
the book you know correct it's correct
 
05:39:49.490 --> 05:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I just don't know how you put
 
05:39:52.570 --> 05:39:52.580 align:start position:0%
that all in statute Rick
 
05:39:55.670 --> 05:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
if you look at the tuition that's the
 
05:39:55.680 --> 05:39:56.890 align:start position:0%
if you look at the tuition that's the
tuition

05:39:56.890 --> 05:39:56.900 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
approval process which we put in place
 
05:40:02.030 --> 05:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with many of the
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
rules that we have like fire code Safety
 
05:40:06.350 --> 05:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
Code building code all those types of
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
things they do not have to comply
 
05:40:10.850 --> 05:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily with all the other aspects
 
05:40:14.690 --> 05:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's that's a local board decision
 
05:40:16.910 --> 05:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
read it well they'd have to comply with
 
05:40:21.230 --> 05:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
idea yeah well yes yes
 
05:40:22.970 --> 05:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
they'd have to do they have to take
 
05:40:22.980 --> 05:40:25.550 align:start position:0%
they'd have to do they have to take
testing

05:40:25.550 --> 05:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:27.410 --> 05:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'd have to go yeah I don't know the
 
05:40:29.448 --> 05:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
answer I don't know if that's exactly
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
the case either it's something we that
 
05:40:33.050 --> 05:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
you got to go check I think that that
 
05:40:35.628 --> 05:40:35.638 align:start position:0%
there possibly are some holes here with
 
05:40:37.310 --> 05:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
the way this has been written that's
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say that it needs to
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
be clear and and I I think not
 
05:40:46.550 --> 05:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
conflicting with other areas of of uh
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
programming which we have provided the
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
local board and even the State Board to
 
05:40:51.120 --> 05:40:52.430 align:start position:0%
local board and even the State Board to
approve

05:40:52.430 --> 05:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
approve
 
05:40:54.948 --> 05:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you
 
05:40:58.250 --> 05:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure where the concept of
 
05:41:00.050 --> 05:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
the commissioner selling this program
 
05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
came in this program was put into place
 
05:41:05.350 --> 05:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
by the legislature by the general court
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
so any statements made by the
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner or anyone else after the
 
05:41:13.490 --> 05:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
fact were clearly based on experiences
 
05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
05:41:18.050 --> 05:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
who were not in the middle of a pandemic
 
05:41:20.208 --> 05:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
also so
 
05:41:22.310 --> 05:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
um to say that this Commit This
 
05:41:24.170 --> 05:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner sold this program I don't
 
05:41:25.850 --> 05:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
think is accurate this program was put
 
05:41:28.850 --> 05:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
into place by the general court period
 
05:41:32.330 --> 05:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay representative yeah I totally
 
05:41:34.550 --> 05:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
disagree with that the commissioner sat
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
right down in the finance office the
 
05:41:38.990 --> 05:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
finance room and basically made his
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
pitch this is where he said it was only
 
05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
going to cost 130 000 so don't tell me
 
05:41:46.610 --> 05:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
that he did not make a pitch publicly on
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
this he absolutely did to this
 
05:41:48.718 --> 05:41:50.868 align:start position:0%
this he absolutely did to this
legislature

05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
that was on supplemental money
 
05:41:55.448 --> 05:41:55.458 align:start position:0%
no it was on efas it's in the budget
 
05:41:58.610 --> 05:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
program though that was a use of federal
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
dollars which were coming down to have
 
05:42:03.050 --> 05:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
the permission to use those dollars for
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
this program no you're talking about the
 
05:42:08.448 --> 05:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
40 40 40 plus a million I'm talking way
 
05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
before that Rick okay okay way before
 
05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
that he made that pitch to the finance
 
05:42:12.540 --> 05:42:14.448 align:start position:0%
that he made that pitch to the finance
committee

05:42:14.448 --> 05:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:42:16.970 --> 05:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
we're representative McDowell thank you
 
05:42:19.128 --> 05:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
I've been listening carefully and to
 
05:42:20.868 --> 05:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
address the points made in this corner
 
05:42:23.270 --> 05:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the room about this varying from the
 
05:42:25.430 --> 05:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner's intent although he was a
 
05:42:27.410 --> 05:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
supporter of the program I see that as
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to this because this bill and
 
05:42:31.850 --> 05:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
other EFA related bills I believe those
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
12 are in front of our committee and
 
05:42:37.070 --> 05:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's our decision right now as to the
 
05:42:38.990 --> 05:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
betterment of this program and the
 
05:42:42.530 --> 05:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
future of it so I don't understand those
 
05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding from it varying from
 
05:42:46.430 --> 05:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
someone's initial intent would you like
 
05:42:47.868 --> 05:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
to explain that further because it just
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
to me seems irrelevant to what we're
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:00.110 --> 05:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
oh sure um yeah the uh the I you know I
 
05:43:02.448 --> 05:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
think I think going to intent is is very
 
05:43:05.690 --> 05:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
important and uh and I think uh uh we
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
look at at legislative intent all the
 
05:43:11.690 --> 05:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
time and one of the biggest policy
 
05:43:13.550 --> 05:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
documents in fact I would argue the
 
05:43:15.830 --> 05:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
largest policy document that this
 
05:43:17.930 --> 05:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
legislature in every legislature does
 
05:43:19.550 --> 05:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
every year
 
05:43:22.490 --> 05:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
um is contained within two bills hb1 and
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 and uh hb2 actually contains all of
 
05:43:30.288 --> 05:43:30.298 align:start position:0%
the in fact it is the only place in
 
05:43:35.150 --> 05:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
statute where um uh where 194 F was uh
 
05:43:37.010 --> 05:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
was created and this is the statute that
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
creates the education Freedom account
 
05:43:45.048 --> 05:43:45.058 align:start position:0%
program and uh and the um uh hb1 and hb2
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
together the uh the state budget uh are
 
05:43:51.890 --> 05:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
basically based on presentations that
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
the finance committee uh takes from
 
05:43:57.890 --> 05:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
department heads from uh from
 
05:44:00.410 --> 05:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from
 
05:44:03.048 --> 05:44:03.058 align:start position:0%
um uh from the chancellors at the at the
 
05:44:04.610 --> 05:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
community college system and University
 
05:44:08.150 --> 05:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
system and from others uh plus they they
 
05:44:10.430 --> 05:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
hear from members of the public uh as
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
well and you can specifically look at
 
05:44:15.770 --> 05:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
the the spreadsheet
 
05:44:17.270 --> 05:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and I'm forgetting what the
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
department called it I think they call
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
it a very detailed spreadsheet or
 
05:44:24.350 --> 05:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
something like that on on exactly how
 
05:44:26.810 --> 05:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
many students where they would be from
 
05:44:30.590 --> 05:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
and what the state uh expense estimate
 
05:44:34.730 --> 05:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
would be uh would be for that and um and
 
05:44:37.610 --> 05:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
and the St the students basically all
 
05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
came from public schools none came from
 
05:44:44.810 --> 05:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
from private schools and um and and uh
 
05:44:48.288 --> 05:44:48.298 align:start position:0%
and that's what was presented and so it
 
05:44:50.628 --> 05:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
is that that was the legislative intent
 
05:44:52.730 --> 05:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's in the budget
 
05:44:55.010 --> 05:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
um tied with the only place where the
 
05:44:58.670 --> 05:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
where the statute was created and um and
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know I'll you know I might argue
 
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
until blue in the face but but but I
 
05:45:04.970 --> 05:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
would I would certainly say that that
 
05:45:07.548 --> 05:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
there was no argument presented to the
 
05:45:09.610 --> 05:45:09.620 align:start position:0%
uh the finance committee or anybody else
 
05:45:12.048 --> 05:45:12.058 align:start position:0%
uh two years ago
 
05:45:13.548 --> 05:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
um when the budget was being written
 
05:45:15.948 --> 05:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
that uh that this would be about uh
 
05:45:19.010 --> 05:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
picking up uh tuition taxpayers picking
 
05:45:20.810 --> 05:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
up tuition bills for kids that were
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
already in private schools
 
05:45:24.470 --> 05:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:45:26.570 --> 05:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I actually wanted to
 
05:45:30.788 --> 05:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
go back to the earlier
 
05:45:33.530 --> 05:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
to the chairs
 
05:45:36.770 --> 05:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
um situation of
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
students who are already going for
 
05:45:41.270 --> 05:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
example to St Johnsbury or Thetford
 
05:45:42.590 --> 05:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
Academy a
 
05:45:44.270 --> 05:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
private school that's used as a public
 
05:45:46.730 --> 05:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
school that districts tuition their
 
05:45:48.708 --> 05:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
students to
 
05:45:51.048 --> 05:45:51.058 align:start position:0%
would it be correct that since those
 
05:45:53.090 --> 05:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
students are already enrolled in those
 
05:45:53.100 --> 05:45:54.650 align:start position:0%
students are already enrolled in those
schools

05:45:54.650 --> 05:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:45:54.660 --> 05:45:56.150 align:start position:0%
schools
and

05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:58.730 --> 05:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
their school system is already paying
 
05:46:00.830 --> 05:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
tuition for them they don't need an EFA
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:07.010 --> 05:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
now the the question was that I had is
 
05:46:10.368 --> 05:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
they want to leave and take an EFA and
 
05:46:13.250 --> 05:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
this says a New Hampshire Public School
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
that they want okay and these are not
 
05:46:17.690 --> 05:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire schools but they are
 
05:46:20.510 --> 05:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
recognized and approved by
 
05:46:23.690 --> 05:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doe or Montpelier
 
05:46:26.448 --> 05:46:26.458 align:start position:0%
and the interstate agreements allow that
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
to occur touch
 
05:46:33.470 --> 05:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:35.570 --> 05:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
yes I believe the words that you said
 
05:46:38.690 --> 05:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
were legislative intent not
 
05:46:41.990 --> 05:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners intent and this bill did
 
05:46:44.330 --> 05:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
not come from the commissioner it came
 
05:46:46.910 --> 05:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
from legislators it came from a lot of
 
05:46:48.770 --> 05:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
us who had worked on it for a long time
 
05:46:51.890 --> 05:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
when it was presented we present we
 
05:46:54.890 --> 05:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
there was no cap so it was certainly not
 
05:46:57.288 --> 05:46:57.298 align:start position:0%
aimed just for people coming from the
 
05:46:59.208 --> 05:46:59.218 align:start position:0%
public school to the private school to
 
05:47:03.288 --> 05:47:03.298 align:start position:0%
or to wherever there was no cap there
 
05:47:05.330 --> 05:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
was a lot of discussion as to whether or
 
05:47:08.690 --> 05:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
not there should be a cap that was put
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
in later before it got put in the bill I
 
05:47:14.230 --> 05:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
mean into the sb2
 
05:47:18.170 --> 05:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
this alleged this initiated
 
05:47:20.810 --> 05:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
from the legislature
 
05:47:24.350 --> 05:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
it was argued by the legislature there
 
05:47:26.208 --> 05:47:26.218 align:start position:0%
were lots of arguments including whether
 
05:47:28.310 --> 05:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
or not there should be a cap whether or
 
05:47:30.350 --> 05:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
not this was something every student was
 
05:47:34.250 --> 05:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
entitled to as part of adequacy to all
 
05:47:35.930 --> 05:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
of our students
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
and this was intended to help provide
 
05:47:40.570 --> 05:47:40.580 align:start position:0%
adequacy to all of our students
 
05:47:43.548 --> 05:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
including those for whom a public school
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
did not work
 
05:47:48.530 --> 05:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
it was that's that was its intent if
 
05:47:50.570 --> 05:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
you're talking about intent
 
05:47:53.448 --> 05:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
by the time it got to yes people were
 
05:47:55.730 --> 05:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
making based estimates
 
05:47:58.910 --> 05:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
their best estimates based on
 
05:48:02.750 --> 05:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in other states that was
 
05:48:05.448 --> 05:48:05.458 align:start position:0%
all we had to go on the estimate was
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
that most private school I mean most
 
05:48:11.110 --> 05:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers were not going to want to
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
and a lot of homeschoolers have not did
 
05:48:15.470 --> 05:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
not want to get involved with the
 
05:48:17.628 --> 05:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
government in order to get money and
 
05:48:19.250 --> 05:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
then all the strings that are attached
 
05:48:21.890 --> 05:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
and many homeschoolers still do not want
 
05:48:26.090 --> 05:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
to do that and did not apply
 
05:48:26.100 --> 05:48:27.770 align:start position:0%
to do that and did not apply
um

05:48:27.770 --> 05:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:29.930 --> 05:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
but they were looking at other states
 
05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
but that is not you can't take I can't
 
05:48:36.650 --> 05:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
take one person coming in here and
 
05:48:39.708 --> 05:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
testifying what they think I I something
 
05:48:42.530 --> 05:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
is going to happen as the intent of the
 
05:48:42.540 --> 05:48:45.770 align:start position:0%
is going to happen as the intent of the
legislature

05:48:45.770 --> 05:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:48.470 --> 05:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
and and so you keep going back to the
 
05:48:50.090 --> 05:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
intent of the commissioner the intent of
 
05:48:51.350 --> 05:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the intent of the
 
05:48:51.360 --> 05:48:52.850 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the intent of the
commissioner

05:48:52.850 --> 05:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
05:48:55.490 --> 05:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
and which have you even asked has he
 
05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
said what isn't that his intent was just
 
05:48:59.090 --> 05:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
that no
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes that was their money estimates based
 
05:49:04.368 --> 05:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
on what we'd seen in other schools but
 
05:49:07.368 --> 05:49:07.378 align:start position:0%
this is our Legend this this was our
 
05:49:09.770 --> 05:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
bill the legislators bill
 
05:49:12.350 --> 05:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of us worked on it it was and and
 
05:49:12.360 --> 05:49:15.650 align:start position:0%
a lot of us worked on it it was and and
Senate

05:49:15.650 --> 05:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:18.830 --> 05:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
the general court this was our bill we
 
05:49:21.650 --> 05:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
had intent it doesn't matter what the
 
05:49:24.590 --> 05:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner did or didn't intend
 
05:49:27.890 --> 05:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
that is not anything to do with what we
 
05:49:30.410 --> 05:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
are deciding what we did decide and what
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
we will decide
 
05:49:34.510 --> 05:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
we want legislative
 
05:49:38.030 --> 05:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:39.890 --> 05:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
get your red light on over there repson
 
05:49:42.530 --> 05:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
Woodcock oh
 
05:49:45.170 --> 05:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh represent Belcher I'll
 
05:49:46.670 --> 05:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
be brief
 
05:49:46.680 --> 05:49:47.448 align:start position:0%
be brief
um

05:49:47.448 --> 05:49:47.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:49.850 --> 05:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
So based on what we've heard I think
 
05:49:52.368 --> 05:49:52.378 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that the or part of
 
05:49:54.110 --> 05:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
the intent behind the bill is that there
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
is a feeling that students who have
 
05:49:59.390 --> 05:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
accessed uh private or not public
 
05:49:59.400 --> 05:50:00.590 align:start position:0%
accessed uh private or not public
schooling

05:50:00.590 --> 05:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
schooling
 
05:50:03.490 --> 05:50:03.500 align:start position:0%
should not then be able to access
 
05:50:05.810 --> 05:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
because these funds because they've
 
05:50:08.270 --> 05:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
already were already in that program
 
05:50:12.230 --> 05:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
however I have yet to hear any ethical
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
or moral argument why a student who is a
 
05:50:18.470 --> 05:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
resident of our state who has parents
 
05:50:21.350 --> 05:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
who are taxpayers of our state is not
 
05:50:24.048 --> 05:50:24.058 align:start position:0%
entitled to a share of what amounts to I
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
think at this point maybe roughly 20
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
percent of the typical costs to educate
 
05:50:31.850 --> 05:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
a public student why they don't have the
 
05:50:33.650 --> 05:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
right to access that money even if they
 
05:50:35.628 --> 05:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
were already
 
05:50:39.250 --> 05:50:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:42.650 --> 05:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
representative yes because the state has
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
has an obligation to provide education
 
05:50:47.150 --> 05:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
for kids and they have chosen that
 
05:50:49.970 --> 05:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
public schools is their obligation
 
05:50:52.190 --> 05:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
parents who choose to go elsewhere
 
05:50:55.368 --> 05:50:55.378 align:start position:0%
that's their choice clearly but it's not
 
05:50:57.770 --> 05:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
based upon taxpayers monies going in
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
that direction
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
so the obligation for the state to
 
05:51:04.128 --> 05:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
provide a public uh anchored well
 
05:51:06.470 --> 05:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
education education for students is
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
through the public school system and the
 
05:51:11.570 --> 05:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
public charter school system that is the
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
choices this state has made so your
 
05:51:16.670 --> 05:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
issue around parents they have all the
 
05:51:18.530 --> 05:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
choice they want to they can stay in the
 
05:51:21.410 --> 05:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
public schools they can go elsewhere but
 
05:51:23.448 --> 05:51:23.458 align:start position:0%
the issue is where is the taxpayer money
 
05:51:25.788 --> 05:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
going to go and that taxpayer money has
 
05:51:28.190 --> 05:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
been determined by the state that is
 
05:51:31.490 --> 05:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
through a public school system
 
05:51:33.770 --> 05:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
and and I would uh
 
05:51:35.030 --> 05:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
go the opposite way on that
 
05:51:36.770 --> 05:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Miler I would say
 
05:51:39.610 --> 05:51:39.620 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance which is statutory
 
05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
and created by us the legislature the
 
05:51:44.570 --> 05:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
people of the State of New Hampshire say
 
05:51:47.930 --> 05:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's four ways to get your education
 
05:51:47.940 --> 05:51:49.250 align:start position:0%
there's four ways to get your education
public

05:51:49.250 --> 05:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:51:53.150 --> 05:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
private homeschooling efas
 
05:51:56.090 --> 05:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
and there are four legs of the required
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance in our state
 
05:52:05.570 --> 05:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:09.230 --> 05:52:09.240 align:start position:0%

technically

05:57:55.548 --> 05:57:55.558 align:start position:0%
technically
 
05:58:00.110 --> 05:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
I the 300 cap we have eliminated many
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
people who are actually in need
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
including the middle class who are
 
05:58:07.610 --> 05:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
always in need because
 
05:58:10.490 --> 05:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
they are not eligible for scholarships
 
05:58:13.128 --> 05:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
they are not but don't make enough money
 
05:58:15.770 --> 05:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
to provide the education that their
 
05:58:18.410 --> 05:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
child actually needs and so this is to
 
05:58:20.628 --> 05:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
reach out to the middle class who got
 
05:58:21.770 --> 05:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
cut off
 
05:58:25.030 --> 05:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
by the 300 percent cap
 
05:58:27.590 --> 05:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
who still can't afford to get the
 
05:58:30.048 --> 05:58:30.058 align:start position:0%
education their children need and yet
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
cannot apply for scholarships or any
 
05:58:35.570 --> 05:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
other Aid because they make too much and
 
05:58:37.910 --> 05:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
this happens all the time they make too
 
05:58:40.610 --> 05:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
much but not enough thank you
 
05:58:42.910 --> 05:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald do you have any
 
05:58:46.070 --> 05:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll keep this brief but to
 
05:58:47.570 --> 05:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
the discussion on the previous Bill
 
05:58:50.570 --> 05:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
about legislative intent as I am aware
 
05:58:52.490 --> 05:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
of those initial discussion with the EFA
 
05:58:54.470 --> 05:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
program as it was passed not to have an
 
05:58:56.448 --> 05:58:56.458 align:start position:0%
income gap so this would be closer to
 
05:58:58.670 --> 05:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
legislative intent as representative
 
05:59:01.850 --> 05:59:01.860 align:start position:0%

06:00:27.958 --> 06:00:28.910 align:start position:0%
recently in in relation to one of the
um

06:00:28.910 --> 06:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:34.368 --> 06:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
School Meal program bills about
 
06:00:36.890 --> 06:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
um the fact that
 
06:00:40.270 --> 06:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
um the free and reduced lunch
 
06:00:43.368 --> 06:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
income cap should be raised to 300
 
06:00:48.430 --> 06:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
percent for everybody because of the
 
06:00:52.190 --> 06:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
inflation and the difficult time people
 
06:00:55.250 --> 06:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
um were having to
 
06:00:58.850 --> 06:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
cope with everything that's going on in
 
06:01:00.788 --> 06:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
terms of prices
 
06:01:03.288 --> 06:01:03.298 align:start position:0%
from the grocery store to the gas
 
06:01:05.170 --> 06:01:05.180 align:start position:0%
station to housing
 
06:01:08.990 --> 06:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I think the same applies for the
 
06:01:11.930 --> 06:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account bill
 
06:01:11.940 --> 06:01:12.830 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account bill
um

06:01:12.830 --> 06:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:15.770 --> 06:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have with me the number but
 
06:01:18.530 --> 06:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony about I think it
 
06:01:21.170 --> 06:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
was several hundred people had applied
 
06:01:24.310 --> 06:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
for efas but we're over the income cap
 
06:01:28.128 --> 06:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
some by most of those I think were under
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars over the 300
 
06:01:33.850 --> 06:01:33.860 align:start position:0%
percent cap
 
06:01:37.250 --> 06:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
this would help those families
 
06:01:37.260 --> 06:01:39.490 align:start position:0%
this would help those families
and

06:01:39.490 --> 06:01:39.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:44.150 --> 06:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
the 300 percent for a family of two a
 
06:01:46.910 --> 06:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
single mother and a child is currently
 
06:01:51.770 --> 06:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:54.948 --> 06:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
um at 300 percent and goes up by less
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
than ten thousand dollars to sixty four
 
06:02:00.770 --> 06:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
thousand eighty five dollars that's for
 
06:02:03.410 --> 06:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
a family of two for a family of four it
 
06:02:05.390 --> 06:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
goes from eighty three thousand two
 
06:02:07.250 --> 06:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty to ninety seven
 
06:02:10.548 --> 06:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
thousand one twenty five
 
06:02:13.730 --> 06:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
so I I think that this is um
 
06:02:16.430 --> 06:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully will be seen as a reasonable
 
06:02:19.850 --> 06:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh compromise to help those
 
06:02:22.910 --> 06:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
um families who have been struggling
 
06:02:25.250 --> 06:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
with the increased prices
 
06:02:28.810 --> 06:02:28.820 align:start position:0%
um and maybe uh declining family income
 
06:02:33.650 --> 06:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
to be able to qualify for the program

ought to pass a Amendment yes
 
06:07:20.330 --> 06:07:20.340 align:start position:0%

amendment is no is not a committee
 
06:07:24.948 --> 06:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's not it's it's the
 
06:07:28.250 --> 06:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
position of the folks that voted for
 
06:07:31.250 --> 06:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
this to ought to pass seeing that it was
 
06:07:34.128 --> 06:07:34.138 align:start position:0%

06:07:38.690 --> 06:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
it'll be written up in the committee
 
06:07:41.330 --> 06:07:41.340 align:start position:0%

there's no committee uh it's not a
 
06:07:45.048 --> 06:07:45.058 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment there's no Amendment
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%

06:08:16.500 --> 06:08:17.570 align:start position:0%

06:26:14.760 --> 06:26:33.970 align:start position:0%
 
second

06:26:33.970 --> 06:26:33.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:38.150 --> 06:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes reading my notes from this
 
06:26:41.810 --> 06:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
bill it was the fact that
 
06:26:44.868 --> 06:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
the results are one printed on the
 
06:26:47.570 --> 06:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
department of Ed website and two every
 
06:26:50.510 --> 06:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
report of the fiscal committee had to
 
06:26:53.750 --> 06:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
include names addresses dollar amount
 
06:26:57.590 --> 06:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
students and they had to report looking
 
06:27:01.750 --> 06:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:04.310 --> 06:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
every three months it was December and
 
06:27:06.410 --> 06:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
November and March and February and it
 
06:27:08.810 --> 06:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
was a lot of reports that aren't
 
06:27:12.410 --> 06:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
required of other public schools and so
 
06:27:16.190 --> 06:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
the hence the repeal of the
 
06:27:18.948 --> 06:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
this section that called for a number of
 
06:27:18.958 --> 06:27:20.510 align:start position:0%
this section that called for a number of
reports

06:27:20.510 --> 06:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
reports
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
in effect it'll it's covered in one
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
yearly report there was no need to do
 
06:28:12.610 --> 06:28:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:14.930 --> 06:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
my understanding is because it's in the
 
06:28:17.090 --> 06:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
RSA and then that's why they want to
 
06:28:24.610 --> 06:28:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:28.128 --> 06:28:28.138 align:start position:0%
so this this applies to what the fiscal
 
06:28:30.230 --> 06:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee receives rather than the
 
06:28:32.390 --> 06:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
education committee receives and I'm
 
06:28:34.070 --> 06:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
just since we have nobody here from
 
06:28:34.080 --> 06:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
just since we have nobody here from
fiscal

06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
06:28:38.208 --> 06:28:38.218 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering and and charter
 
06:28:41.510 --> 06:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
schools are a uh under the non-profit
 
06:28:45.590 --> 06:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
um rules of the State uh and are managed
 
06:28:47.690 --> 06:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
by a board of directors it
 
06:28:50.090 --> 06:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we have I just don't
 
06:28:52.250 --> 06:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
understand why we have it I had wished
 
06:28:55.548 --> 06:28:55.558 align:start position:0%
you'd vacated it to fiscal but um I'm
 
06:28:57.350 --> 06:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
just wondering why those those two
 
06:29:00.170 --> 06:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
things don't add up that perhaps that's
 
06:29:02.990 --> 06:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
why they they have the reporting so
 
06:29:06.948 --> 06:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
often and that it was a you know
 
06:29:09.470 --> 06:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
a program that
 
06:29:12.890 --> 06:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
had to I don't think
 
06:29:14.448 --> 06:29:14.458 align:start position:0%
I don't think they have the same
 
06:29:16.670 --> 06:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
requirements as a public school as far
 
06:29:19.670 --> 06:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
as the funding is concerned so
 
06:29:22.310 --> 06:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and it may be something fiscal needs
 
06:29:28.250 --> 06:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:31.010 --> 06:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
I yes I think we've been through the
 
06:29:33.948 --> 06:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for the public charter
 
06:29:38.510 --> 06:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
schools but also this goes to my reading
 
06:29:40.190 --> 06:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
of as it goes to the fiscal committee
 
06:29:43.250 --> 06:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
rather than Finance which is a different
 
06:29:46.850 --> 06:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
ball game in itself the fiscal committee
 
06:29:50.090 --> 06:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
that could you explain it there is a
 
06:29:52.670 --> 06:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee that meets
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think on a monthly basis
 
06:29:59.270 --> 06:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
um uh versus the state excuse me versus
 
06:30:02.448 --> 06:30:02.458 align:start position:0%
the house or Senate Finance committees
 
06:30:04.788 --> 06:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
there it's a separate body it's a joint
 
06:30:09.070 --> 06:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:12.590 --> 06:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
they approve various new funding
 
06:30:15.048 --> 06:30:15.058 align:start position:0%
mechanisms grants things that come up
 
06:30:17.590 --> 06:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
during the course of the year
 
06:30:19.730 --> 06:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
let me go ahead and explain that a
 
06:30:22.788 --> 06:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
little bit fiscal uh is a committee
 
06:30:26.030 --> 06:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
which last year was chaired by represent
 
06:30:27.770 --> 06:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
umberger it was pretty well split you
 
06:30:30.708 --> 06:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
know with Republican Democrat when I
 
06:30:33.890 --> 06:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
chair the as chair of the commission for
 
06:30:36.650 --> 06:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure Monies
 
06:30:39.590 --> 06:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that's you know that's totaled
 
06:30:42.530 --> 06:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
well we're up around 40 43 million
 
06:30:44.090 --> 06:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
dollars which we've had to allocate out
 
06:30:45.890 --> 06:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
with the last several years all combined
 
06:30:45.900 --> 06:30:46.850 align:start position:0%
with the last several years all combined
together

06:30:46.850 --> 06:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
together
 
06:30:49.670 --> 06:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
the the public school infrastructure
 
06:30:52.190 --> 06:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
committee makes a recommendation for how
 
06:30:54.708 --> 06:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
these where the monies will go to which
 
06:30:54.718 --> 06:30:56.090 align:start position:0%
these where the monies will go to which
districts

06:30:56.090 --> 06:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
districts
 
06:30:59.090 --> 06:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
then what fiscal does is they then the
 
06:31:02.030 --> 06:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
the recommendation has to go to fiscal
 
06:31:04.490 --> 06:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
for clearance to ensure that we're
 
06:31:07.128 --> 06:31:07.138 align:start position:0%
spending money that we have
 
06:31:10.850 --> 06:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
that's available and then then from
 
06:31:12.490 --> 06:31:12.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal the public school
 
06:31:15.470 --> 06:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
structure monies would then by Statue
 
06:31:17.208 --> 06:31:17.218 align:start position:0%
have to go to Governor Council for
 
06:31:17.218 --> 06:31:18.350 align:start position:0%
have to go to Governor Council for
approval

06:31:18.350 --> 06:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
approval
 
06:31:21.948 --> 06:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
so fiscal is a committee is Watchdogs
 
06:31:24.288 --> 06:31:24.298 align:start position:0%
available dollars and which will also
 
06:31:27.410 --> 06:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
approve Grant monies which come in we
 
06:31:28.788 --> 06:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
talked about that 40 million dollars
 
06:31:31.010 --> 06:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
earlier and fiscal was not in the
 
06:31:33.470 --> 06:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
business of of approving that it's not
 
06:31:35.868 --> 06:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
division two it's or three or one which
 
06:31:37.730 --> 06:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
is how the finance committee this is
 
06:31:41.990 --> 06:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
made up of members from finance that act
 
06:31:44.330 --> 06:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
on to ensure monies are available and
 
06:31:46.670 --> 06:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
how they're how they're used
 
06:31:50.030 --> 06:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
um in many cases it's joint Senate and
 
06:31:50.040 --> 06:31:51.948 align:start position:0%
um in many cases it's joint Senate and
House

06:31:51.948 --> 06:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
House
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
so with with public charter schools uh
 
06:31:59.810 --> 06:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
some of them haven't been physically
 
06:31:59.820 --> 06:32:00.470 align:start position:0%
some of them haven't been physically
um

06:32:00.470 --> 06:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:02.868 --> 06:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
able to to make it I mean there's been
 
06:32:06.110 --> 06:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
at least one I know that's gone uh
 
06:32:08.868 --> 06:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
because of phys financial things that
 
06:32:11.330 --> 06:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
was a charter conversion school yeah and
 
06:32:13.730 --> 06:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
and I think there were a couple others
 
06:32:17.570 --> 06:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
that had physical problems and would
 
06:32:19.070 --> 06:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
this watchdog
 
06:32:22.670 --> 06:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh committee actually be helpful in
 
06:32:25.070 --> 06:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
seeing when a charter was getting close
 
06:32:28.010 --> 06:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
to having a financial problem and be
 
06:32:30.410 --> 06:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
able is that one no that's not one of
 
06:32:32.690 --> 06:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities they are they only
 
06:32:36.650 --> 06:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
look at expenditures in in the use of
 
06:32:39.048 --> 06:32:39.058 align:start position:0%
monies the oversight that they're not an
 
06:32:41.150 --> 06:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee like we have for so
 
06:32:42.430 --> 06:32:42.440 align:start position:0%

06:32:44.448 --> 06:32:44.458 align:start position:0%
Improvement and assessment we have an
 
06:32:47.208 --> 06:32:47.218 align:start position:0%
oversight committee yeah
 
06:32:49.070 --> 06:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very different represent like

us
 
06:32:54.170 --> 06:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
when we had that meeting at
 
06:32:56.810 --> 06:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
um Granite State College and we asked
 
06:32:59.390 --> 06:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
that question they said that this law
 
06:33:02.690 --> 06:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
was put in when they had first started
 
06:33:04.730 --> 06:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
doing charter schools and they had no
 
06:33:07.548 --> 06:33:07.558 align:start position:0%
idea how the whole thing would work and
 
06:33:09.230 --> 06:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
that at this point it's all taken care
 
06:33:11.510 --> 06:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
of otherwise and that was not needed
 
06:33:11.520 --> 06:33:17.628 align:start position:0%
of otherwise and that was not needed
anymore

06:33:17.628 --> 06:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:20.150 --> 06:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
06:33:22.430 --> 06:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
true yes representative enough yeah
 
06:33:24.890 --> 06:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so
 
06:33:27.590 --> 06:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the um you know as the as the department
 
06:33:29.868 --> 06:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
I think had had mentioned during the
 
06:33:29.878 --> 06:33:31.190 align:start position:0%
I think had had mentioned during the
hearing

06:33:31.190 --> 06:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:33:34.850 --> 06:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
um history 71 repeals
 
06:33:40.788 --> 06:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
paragraph e in 194 b11 won Roman one
 
06:33:43.850 --> 06:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so submit a report to fiscal many two
 
06:33:45.350 --> 06:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the general court for each payment
 
06:33:48.410 --> 06:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
made in a fiscal year by the state to a
 
06:33:50.390 --> 06:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
chartered public school pursuant to
 
06:33:55.750 --> 06:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
some paragraph C talks about how the how
 
06:34:01.730 --> 06:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
the department
 
06:34:04.970 --> 06:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
um shall calculate payments made to
 
06:34:07.788 --> 06:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools and the first payment
 
06:34:10.430 --> 06:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
shall be 30 percent of the per pupil
 
06:34:13.490 --> 06:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
amount multiplied by and it goes It goes
 
06:34:14.810 --> 06:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
on there
 
06:34:19.788 --> 06:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
um is is that report is there is the
 
06:34:22.510 --> 06:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
department of education required to
 
06:34:27.170 --> 06:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
submit that report by Statute anywhere
 
06:34:27.180 --> 06:34:28.190 align:start position:0%
submit that report by Statute anywhere
else

06:34:28.190 --> 06:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
else
 
06:34:30.048 --> 06:34:30.058 align:start position:0%
um because they they do submit the
 
06:34:35.090 --> 06:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:37.010 --> 06:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
I don't have the answer to that I I
 
06:34:38.208 --> 06:34:38.218 align:start position:0%
don't either
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I I just I don't know why why
 
06:34:44.570 --> 06:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
where we're repealing
 
06:34:47.750 --> 06:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
um reports that have to do with the use
 
06:34:50.750 --> 06:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
of taxpayer money to support Public
 
06:34:50.760 --> 06:34:54.110 align:start position:0%
of taxpayer money to support Public
Schools

06:34:54.110 --> 06:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:55.788 --> 06:34:55.798 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative I'm just
 
06:34:57.110 --> 06:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
wondering what
 
06:34:59.750 --> 06:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
reports do public school traditional
 
06:35:01.548 --> 06:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
Public Schools submit to the fiscal
 
06:35:04.010 --> 06:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
committee on a monthly basis
 
06:35:06.708 --> 06:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
well the the pub the school doesn't so
 
06:35:08.990 --> 06:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
the public schools don't submit it and
 
06:35:11.150 --> 06:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
the the Charter Public Schools don't
 
06:35:12.948 --> 06:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
submit it either it's the commissioner
 
06:35:15.288 --> 06:35:15.298 align:start position:0%
of of Education the Department of
 
06:35:18.770 --> 06:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
Education that that submits uh these
 
06:35:23.510 --> 06:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
reports and um and and you know as they
 
06:35:26.390 --> 06:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
so that's that's it it's not I mean
 
06:35:28.250 --> 06:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
Public Schools
 
06:35:30.830 --> 06:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
I have to file tons of reports with the
 
06:35:33.170 --> 06:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and and it's up
 
06:35:36.288 --> 06:35:36.298 align:start position:0%
to the you know in in this case the the
 
06:35:39.048 --> 06:35:39.058 align:start position:0%
charter schools are
 
06:35:41.330 --> 06:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
um receiving
 
06:35:44.390 --> 06:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
their their their grants essentially
 
06:35:48.410 --> 06:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:51.048 --> 06:35:51.058 align:start position:0%
their grants over and above the the cost
 
06:35:53.170 --> 06:35:53.180 align:start position:0%
of inadequate education from the state
 
06:35:56.570 --> 06:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
and uh and I and it sounds like this is
 
06:35:56.580 --> 06:35:57.470 align:start position:0%
and uh and I and it sounds like this is
what

06:35:57.470 --> 06:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:35:59.090 --> 06:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
that report
 
06:36:00.948 --> 06:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
that report it's doing I mean it's
 
06:36:03.470 --> 06:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the that the commissioner
 
06:36:09.230 --> 06:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes how else do we know well I I from my
 
06:36:15.110 --> 06:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
notes on representative Mooney's
 
06:36:19.310 --> 06:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
testimony is that this was a 20 000 in
 
06:36:23.990 --> 06:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
2016 law change but the report is moot
 
06:36:26.270 --> 06:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
now because of the ability
 
06:36:28.310 --> 06:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
um for
 
06:36:30.830 --> 06:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
um a warrant article to be drawn anytime
 
06:36:34.310 --> 06:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
there is the need for funds in terms of
 
06:36:36.410 --> 06:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund well wouldn't
 
06:36:38.410 --> 06:36:38.420 align:start position:0%
we want to have wouldn't the report
 
06:36:42.230 --> 06:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
contain that that additional funds
 
06:36:44.530 --> 06:36:44.540 align:start position:0%
um drawn by the governor on a warrant
 
06:36:47.990 --> 06:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and I don't think I don't think the
 
06:36:49.970 --> 06:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
part that's being repealed was the 2016
 
06:36:52.368 --> 06:36:52.378 align:start position:0%
law I think I mean I'm looking at my
 
06:36:54.890 --> 06:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
notes and I'm saying 2016 a lot of
 
06:36:58.310 --> 06:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
change and what was changed
 
06:37:01.548 --> 06:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
and and and I agree using representative
 
06:37:04.030 --> 06:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
Mooney's words makes the report moved
 
06:37:07.548 --> 06:37:07.558 align:start position:0%
but I'm not but there was no reference
 
06:37:11.930 --> 06:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
to to what what that was and what
 
06:37:13.368 --> 06:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
actually requires
 
06:37:16.610 --> 06:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
any report to be made available on the
 
06:37:20.030 --> 06:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:24.830 --> 06:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just you know I I I I think that the
 
06:37:28.368 --> 06:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee does get status reports
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
on the
 
06:37:32.270 --> 06:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
um status of various funds including the
 
06:37:34.128 --> 06:37:34.138 align:start position:0%
education trust fund because I I've
 
06:37:36.410 --> 06:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
gotten information from them
 
06:37:39.350 --> 06:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
um about the Surplus and so forth yeah
 
06:37:41.150 --> 06:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
I've got I've got that that's that's
 
06:37:43.490 --> 06:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
contained in the kafir the annual report
 
06:37:47.810 --> 06:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
as well but but it doesn't break it down
 
06:37:47.820 --> 06:37:48.610 align:start position:0%
as well but but it doesn't break it down
um

06:37:48.610 --> 06:37:48.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:53.090 --> 06:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
the way the way certainly the the um the
 
06:37:55.448 --> 06:37:55.458 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education breaks down
 
06:37:58.368 --> 06:37:58.378 align:start position:0%
payments to everything I think what I'm
 
06:38:00.470 --> 06:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to do on this is that this is not
 
06:38:02.628 --> 06:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
an early Bill okay it seems like there
 
06:38:05.390 --> 06:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
are some questions yeah I I'm familiar
 
06:38:07.910 --> 06:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
with fiscal but I I I've never you know
 
06:38:09.708 --> 06:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
they meet on Fridays and I don't really
 
06:38:14.208 --> 06:38:14.218 align:start position:0%
do that right so so what we can do is we
 
06:38:18.410 --> 06:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
can you know just recess this bill get
 
06:38:21.288 --> 06:38:21.298 align:start position:0%
some folks in from fiscal and and and
 
06:38:24.830 --> 06:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
and doe as well it just get some answers
 
06:38:26.930 --> 06:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
so it may be just very simple thing to
 
06:38:29.810 --> 06:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
resolve but I too it's like signing a
 
06:38:31.310 --> 06:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
check and not what we're doing knowing
 
06:38:33.410 --> 06:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here and not reading
 
06:38:35.810 --> 06:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
the fine print so I would like to know
 
06:38:37.850 --> 06:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
more so that's fair enough so let's just
 
06:38:40.010 --> 06:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
recess this and not get a gut ache on it
 
06:38:42.530 --> 06:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
right now and and drive home in some
 
06:38:42.540 --> 06:38:45.730 align:start position:0%
right now and and drive home in some
light

06:38:45.730 --> 06:38:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:49.070 --> 06:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much we are adjourned
 
06:38:51.170 --> 06:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
