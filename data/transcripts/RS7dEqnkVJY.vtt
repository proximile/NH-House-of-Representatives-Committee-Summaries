00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
Canada New Hampshire
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
relationship it just so happens that 75
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
years ago the government of Canada
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
opened its first office in Boston to
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
represent Canada's interests throughout
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
New England but of course the strong
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
connections between Canada and new
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
englanders date back long before then
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
our communities starting with our
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
indigenous people who were the first to
 
00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
inhabit the land have found reasons to
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
exchange create innovate and build
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
together for
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
centuries the people of New Hampshire
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
know this better than anyone some of
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
your families may have been among those
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
who migrated from Quebec or aadia to
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
work in the M towns in New Hampshire
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
over a century ago contributing a
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
Vibrant frankophone Community and an
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
affinity for patin that continues to
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
this day in Berlin lonia NASA and
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester and as a side note my home in
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
Canada is about 20 minutes from lonia in
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
Nova Scotia and the exchanges between
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
our communities have only grown from
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
there there are fun exchanges like when
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
our hockey teams play volleyball play
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
here or your volleyball teams cross the
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
border to participate in tournaments
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
with their Canadian neighbors or the
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
Canadian musicians who travel South to
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
play in your concert halls and
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
nightclubs like the word Barn in exiter
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
owned and operated by a Canadian
 
00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:29.269 align:start position:0%
owned and operated by a Canadian
American

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
American
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
couple there are also helpful exchanges
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
like when New England firefighters
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
traveled North last summer to assist us
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
as we battled wildfires not far from my
 
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
home in the Southshore of Nova
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
Scotia just as Canadian linesmen and
 
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
women have been known to come to the
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
South South when a nor Easter knocks out
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
your power lines the point is we have
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
always been there for one another and
 
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here to tell you today you can count
 
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:02.290 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
there because we are at a critical
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
moment for the ca for Canada the US and
 
00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:14.839 align:start position:0%
the world we're on the edge of a
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
generational shift as issues like
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
climate change and artificial
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
intelligence demonstrate the potential
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
to profoundly alter the ways we all live
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
in the after in the aftermath of the
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic that isolated our
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
communities and in the face of ongoing
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
conflicts like those in Ukraine and the
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
Middle East that continue to stretch our
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
supply chains we're also seeing a
 
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
historic Global geopolitical
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
realignment in the face of these many
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
complex challenges we know that the
 
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
solutions to these problems will not
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
emerge from one country they are
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
challenges that we all must tackle
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
together for Canada the path to
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
successfully meeting these challenges
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
runs straight through the us and for the
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
US the path to success runs straight
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
through Canada our two countries share
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
more than a border we share the same
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
values democracy rule of law respect for
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
human rights free markets the balance of
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
IND individual freedoms and Collective
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities these shared values
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
have been the basis for our strong
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and international
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
cooperation for decades and as we look
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
to the Future these shared values will
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
continue to be the bed Rock foundation
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
of the deep Mutual trust and
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration that will guide our two
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
countries to reach our greatest
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
potential I'll give you an
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
example as New Hampshire aims to meet
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
its decarbonization and energy security
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
goals your best path to success is
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
straight through Canada your path to net
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
zero emissions lies with the people in
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
Ontario who will make the electric
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle batteries that will power those
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
F-150 lightnings in your driveway or or
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
to the people in the mine in Quebec who
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
will Source the critical minerals
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to power the battery in that
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
car globally the race is on to secure
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
access to critical minerals like lithium
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
graphite and nickel these critical
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
minerals are essential building blocks
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
not only for electric vehicles but for
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
renewable energy production and storage
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
like wind turbines off the coast or the
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
semiconductors found in your iPhone or
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
the MRI machine in your local
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
hospital if New Hampshire is to be a
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
leader in the green IND digital
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
economies you will need reliable trusted
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
source of critical minerals You Can
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
Count On Us Canada has 31 such critical
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
minerals so there we are here for you
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
count on us not only because we have the
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
resources but because we share your
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
values values of free competition of
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
strong labor and environmental standards
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's thanks to those shared values that
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
North America has become an economic
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
Powerhouse the strength strength of the
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
Canada US economic relationship simply
 
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
cannot be understated we trade over $1
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
trillion doll in goods and services Al
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
annually that's over
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
$250 million every
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
day as your colleagues on the New
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Canadian Train Council know
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Canada economic
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
relationship alone accounts for over $35
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
billion doar of two-way
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
trade China may be the United States's
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
number one largest trading partner but
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
the fact is Canada is your largest
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
customer we buy more from the United
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
States than China France and Japan
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
combined and New Hampshire companies
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
have a strong role in that you exported
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
over $1.3 billion dollar in goods and
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
services to Canada in
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
2022 but what is truly remarkable about
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
our free and balanced trading
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
relationship at that we not only sell
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
things to each other
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
we make things together in fact most
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
Canadian exports to the US are inputs
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
that contribute to US manufactured goods
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
which are then sold around the
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
world whether it's the Saskatchewan oats
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
that are manufactured into Cheerios in
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
Upstate New York or the specialized
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
piece of Machinery tooled here in New
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that eventually Finds Its way
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
into an aircraft built in Montreal or
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's the auto that crosses the
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
Border seven or eight times before it's
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
finally assembled in either aaga or
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
Michigan or maybe it's the energy that
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
flows on one of the 70 plus pipelines
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
and transmission lines that cross our
 
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
border every day keeping the lights on
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
in the factories and the homes in each
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
and every one of our
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
communities no matter the sector we
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
build things together it's that trade
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
that directly contributes to New
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economic prosperity and
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
competitiveness Canadians and new
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
hampshirites share the same goal we want
 
00:21:59.789 --> 00:21:59.799 align:start position:0%
good jobs that will help our communities
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
keep up with the rising cost of living
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that will pave the way for healthier

a border between us after all we are two

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker the
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
motion we have in front of us is for
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of House Bill 1002 a
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill that certainly passed this body a
 
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider should state with
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
some specificity the basis on which the
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
vote on the bill overlooked some
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
critical decision points created some
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
conflict in law or Overlook clear and
 
00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:56.919 align:start position:0%
obvious facts for instance if we had
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
passed passed a bill authorizing a
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
national Safety hotline and discovered
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
later in the day that the hotline was
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
taken down or didn't work then I would
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
suspect we would want to reconsider our
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
ba our vote based on those facts facts
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
in this instance on House Bill 2002 we
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
had a lengthy debate on the facts we do
 
00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:21.799 align:start position:0%
not have new facts that reshaped the
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
merits of the bill we did not make an
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
error that puts the bill in conflict
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
with law we took a vote the bill passed
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of a bill where there
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
were no errors and there's no new
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
information sets a very bad precedent a
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
precedent that will be difficult to
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
justify with our constituents Mr Speaker
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
I urge my colleagues to press the red
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
button to reject the motion to
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
reconsider so that house bill 102 can go
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
to the body on the other side of the
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
wall and be judged on its own me merits
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
again again please press the red button
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
to oppose the motion thank you chair
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you Mr chair I urge you all
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
to reconsider your vote on HB 10002 for
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
the following reasons for several in
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
this body circumstances have changed and
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
new information has come to light since
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
they cast their vote as we all know is
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
essential to stay informed and consider
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
all relevant factors before making a
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
decision hence we need to provide them
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
with the opportunity and support this
 
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.149 align:start position:0%

00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
consideration many representatives that
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
I heard from did not understand the full
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
scope of the impact and potential
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
consequences their vote on HB
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
10002 would have on their communities
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
but moreover all of New Hampshire whe
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%

Kenny uh thank you Mr Speaker um so I am
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
standing up today to urge my colleagues
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
to support the
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
reconsideration um that is in front of
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
us uh so look I I know we've heard about
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
amendments that are here and other
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
options we should do but if we can get
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
past reconsideration I do believe that
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
the committee can do more work on this
 
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
bill um and I guess the only thing I
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
would add is please don't let how you
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
voted before um make you feel obligated
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
to vote some way today new information
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
has come up over the past week we have
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
learned new things that we should look
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
into before we make changes to 91a and
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
um I do think we should have a
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
discussion before sending it to the
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall thank you Mr
 
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.910 align:start position:0%

Speaker

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
Lyn thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure to be completely
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
candidate in the interest of time I'm
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
not sure that I could say very much more
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
than my colleague from Hampton so
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
eloquently said in order to cons to
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
consider her motion for reconsideration
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there really does
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
need to be something new what have you
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
heard about what's new I submit to you
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
respectfully that both in in the
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
committee where the where you know this
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
was not a unanimous vote it's not like
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
this was a unanimous vote in the
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
committee and then all of a sudden you
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
know something new came up there this
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill was fully debated in the committee
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
and there was bipartisan support and
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
candidly there was bipartisan opposition
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
I respectfully submit to you that
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed there is no new
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
information we made the right decision
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
this is a perfectly reasonable bill just
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
as 37 other states have similar kinds of
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
things I urge you to reject the motion
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
for reconsideration thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%

that this is an important policy but it

is not ready to pass if I further
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
know that any work that needs to happen
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
on this bill could happen without with
 
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
or without going to the Judiciary
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
Committee and if I know that a floor
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment at a later time could be
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
brought up to address the unintended
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
um I may be wrong but I thought that I
 
00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:03.079 align:start position:0%
just heard in debate on the on the
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider that there was much
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
additional information that needed to be
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
presented if that's true I assume that
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
most people would agree that the way new
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
information is usually presented is at a
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
committee I assume that the prior
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
speaker wasn't suggesting that we would
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
bring in Witnesses before the whole
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
house to testify it if we're going If
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
there really is more information that
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be representative this a this
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
is a parliamentary inquiry I'm sorry if
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
I knew that there really was more
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
information to be presented and that the
 
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:40.559 align:start position:0%
traditional and really the only place
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
that it can practically be presented is
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
Moffett thank you Mr Speaker I Le speak
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
very briefly uh in favor of the ilt
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
motion from from the committee uh
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
quickly in in the Marine Corps every
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
Marine is a Rifleman every Marine has to
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
qualify on the rifle range it's a
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
universal requirement everybody shares
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
brings everybody together in fact the
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's son is doing that this
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
week he's graduating from Paris Island
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
so my point is that uh to have car
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
voutes or exceptions to take away the
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
universality of something that puts
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
everybody together is not a good thing
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
uh this new Civics test requirement
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
every single high school graduate now is
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
to take and pass that we're hearing some
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
really cool things about every school
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
doing it uh so to carve out exceptions
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh well intended for whether it's Civil
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
Air Patrol or Roc is something that uh
 
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:18.799 align:start position:0%
many of us oppose and so we support the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
itl thank you Mr
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:33.589 align:start position:0%

00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh I'm speaking on
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan vote on this committee to
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
itl it it's important to note that we a
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
year ago two years ago actually we
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
passed this motion to have every senior
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
take the um the test before they
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
graduate the committee looked at this
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
and said well why are we going going to
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
just take certain students away from
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
having this having to take this
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
particular exam and I'm surprised that
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh the representative would speak that
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
we should have this carve out because he
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
was the one we the he was the advocate
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
for that wanted this for everyone to
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
take it now we're trying to say oh let's
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
take these folks out there's no question
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
that the roazzi program and the Civil
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
Air program is a very valuable program
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
but it would SE that the Committees
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
respect for those students who are in
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
that program that they should still take
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
the test just as every other graduate
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
has to take the test so I would urge the
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
body here uh to respect the will of the

Speaker Mr Speaker I'd like to ask my
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
colleagues to imagine for a moment what
 
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
it might be like if you were never able
 
00:52:57.559 --> 00:52:59.309 align:start position:0%
it might be like if you were never able
to

00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
speak you have the capacity for
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
language you can understand it you can
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
hear it you can even think
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
it but for your entire life you have
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
never been able to
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
speak now imagine on top of that that
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
you have a neurological condition that
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
inclines you not to make eye contact
 
00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.870 align:start position:0%
inclines you not to make eye contact
with

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
people people around you see someone who
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
appears to be staring off into
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
space they assume that perhaps you're
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
intelligent this is the Fate that many
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
people with
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
Autism and specifically with apraxia
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
suffer from they are locked in a prison
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
of non-communication for their entire
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
lives now imagine that somebody comes to
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
you and says I know you're smart I know
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
you're in there
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
I have found a way to teach people to
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
communicate people like
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
you and I'm going to work with you and
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
we can do this and I've never met
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
it Gregory Tino a young man who lives in
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
the Philadelphia area describes that as
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
began he wrote several years ago people
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
thought that I had the intellect of a
 
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.309 align:start position:0%
thought that I had the intellect of a
three-year-old

00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
three-year-old
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
then I learned to use a letter
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
board he has since learned to use a
 
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
keyboard he Types on a
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
speaks in the hearing on this bill we
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
had people ask as so in the early stages
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
of this process do you have to teach
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
people letters and they said oh no they
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
already know the
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
letters in
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
fact one parent testified that her son
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
knows Spanish she said we have no idea
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
how he knows
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
Spanish but he likes to answer some of
 
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
Spanish this bill would create a modest
 
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
Spanish this bill would create a modest
pilot

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
program to make spell to communicate

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire The Total Money authorized
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill would be
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
$250,000 over two
 
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
years roughly the equivalent of one
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
full-time person for two years after
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
three years the bill repeals
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
itself there were two primary arguments
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
made against this bill number one this
 
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
is facilitated communication the answer
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
is no it's not there is a methodology
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
ology called facilitated communication
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
that was discredited years ago
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
because the communication was not coming
 
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
from the person with autism it was
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
discredited spelling to communicate
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
enables free and independent
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
communication I've seen it myself people
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
typing on a keyboard no one is sitting
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
with them no one is helping them they
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
are fully communicating answering
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
the second criticism is that there is a
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
studies there are a number of studies in
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
methodology I would argue though that
 
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.630 align:start position:0%
methodology I would argue though that
for

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
$250,000 we could invest in a
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
tremendously promising
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
Innovation Innovation doesn't wait 5 10
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
15 years for a raft of PE peer-reviewed
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
studies to come out we have an
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity today for a very modest
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
money to create a program and expand
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
autism I'm asking you I'm asking my
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
chance the much better rebuttal to the
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
argument that there are no peer-reviewed
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
studies is the long list of Highly
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
accomplished people who have discovered
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
this and whose lives have changed as a

hear from
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
parents is that for the first time my
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
son or daughter can explain to the
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
doctor exactly what's wrong with them
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
it gives them dignity I heard a story of
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
one young man the first thing he said
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
when he could spell was mom could you
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
ask Dad to stop telling me asking me if
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
I need to go potty I'm 21 years
 
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
dignity and it's about independence I
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how many people I've
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
heard from who said we have worried all
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
our lives what's going to happen to our
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
son or daughter when we're not around
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
anymore and for the first time ever we
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
know that he can communicate she can
 
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
communicate they won't have that utter
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
incomplete dependency on us
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
anymore if this bill passes today it
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
will go on to the finance
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
again I'm asking my colleagues today to
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
give Innovation a chance give people
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
with autism and araxia a
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
chance and press the red button so that
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
an alternate motion can be made thank
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr

requires physical guidance and prompting

not be considered as a valid means of

with a board certified behavior analyst

who specializes in services for children
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
with autism she was clear that quote it
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
is unfathomable that a New Hampshire
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
Department would consider this program
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
as a technique that has no scientific
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
research to support it and has been
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
scientifically discredited as a
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
technique technique now this is not to
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
say that spelling to commun communicate
 
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
didn't work with
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
some why would we want our public
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
dollars to be spent on such a program
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
that has no scientifically based
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
evidence of positive results and
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%

EFA program was originally instituted it
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be for the neediest
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
students and families in our states at a
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
cost of about
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
$300,000 now what we see is a program
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
that is costing taxpayers something into
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
the ballpark of $24 million a year with
 
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.030 align:start position:0%

eligibility in income so that graned
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
state families making six figures can
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
apply for and be eligible for this
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
program private schools in this state
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
are not required to provide some of the
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
special education services that our
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
students need we have taxpayer money
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to those schools and yet those
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
students need to get those Services back
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
in the districts that are funded by
 
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollar
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
these private schools are not required
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
to comply to Title 9 requirements in a
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
number of cases they are fully free to
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate against students based on
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that they don't have to comply
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
to those Title 9 requirements our Public
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
Schools can't discriminate they don't
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
discriminate that's the beauty that's
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
the virtue of our Public Schools that's
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
why thriving public school systems are
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential they're absolutely
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
indispensable to aun functioning
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
democracy and to the production of
 
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
citizens who are capable of
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
participating in a functioning
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
democracy Public Schools exist to serve
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
all of our students not just some of
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
them our teachers work hard every day to
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
meet them where they are and in those
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
cases where they're not able to meet the
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
needs of those students then appropriate
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
accommodations are sought we have seen
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
an expansion of this program we have
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
heard about its successes we have seen
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
no evidence to support the claims of
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
these successes because there is no
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
accountability because we are not
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
following up to make sure that that
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollar is actually being used
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
in the ways that we've been told it's
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used for all of those
 
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
reasons Mr Speaker I oppose the OTP
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Public Schools I would say by

and large my education at conquered High
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
School set me up for success in college
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
and graduate school and provided me the
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
foundational education needed to be in
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
front of you today my story is not about
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
educational Excellence it's about my
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
struggle coming to a realization that I
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
like men I realized I was gay during my
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
years at conquered high school and I
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time reflecting on what
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
it meant for myself my family and my
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
community at that time I was not
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable telling classmates and
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
friends about my sexuality I would see
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
the way other classmates spoke about and
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
treated those perceived to be gay or had
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
already come out I wasn't ready to to
 
01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.390 align:start position:0%
already come out I wasn't ready to to
speak

01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%

01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
up I remember one situation in which I
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
was standing at the bus stop behind the
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
school after we were released and a
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
friend of my friend told me that the way
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
I was standing was gay and if I wanted
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
to seem straight I would have to stand
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
in a different
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
way that was 10 years ago and in the way
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
we perceive members of my community have
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
changed I have also become proud of the
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
man that I've
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
become however I'm speaking today in
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
support of 1561 because I believe
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
students students like me should have
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
the choice to attend a school they feel
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
more comfortable at students who
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
identify as
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
lgbtq or like me may not be comfortable
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
enough admitting it yet should be able
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
to attend a school that works better for
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
them and their family and our state
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
government should support that hb1 1561
 
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
is a pro lgbtq bill because it provides
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
for the ability to use educational
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
Freedom that may be to attend a school
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
that may be more welcoming to them
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
I hope all of my friends who support
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
lgbtq rights as I do would vote in
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%

01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
1561 is a bill to expand the eligibility
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
to qualify for the educational Freedom
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
accounts the EFA program was originally
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
designed and introduced as a program to
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
provide economically challenged families
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
a voucher to choose a private school or
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
to assist in homeschooling for their
 
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
child the one-time household income
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
requirement originally set in 2022 was
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
less than or equal to 300% of the

350% of poverty
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
which is about
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
$109,000 for a family of
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
four requirements also include that a
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%

4,000 children receiving the yearly
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
money from the EFA 75% of those students

did not come from the public school
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
system but were already going to a
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
private school or a religious school the
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
cost for the current year is estimated
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
at $60

fund HP 1561 expands this program that
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
has little oversight or accountability
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
either academically or financially by
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
adding nine new categories of
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility in place of the income
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for an EFA if they meet the

following
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
conditions if they're concerned that
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
attending a school could lead to the
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
spread of contagious diseases like
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
covid-19 the common cold seasonal flu
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
pneumonia or others they would be
 
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
eligible if they feel they are a victim
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
of persistent bullying which is defined
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
as three or more
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
incidents they would qualify if they
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
test Ted in the 25th percentile and
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
state standardized testing in any
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
subject they would qualify if they were
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with an eating
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
disorder they would qualify if they were
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with a mental health
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
condition they would qualify if the
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
district guidance counselor determined
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
that it would be in the best interest of
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
the child to be in another
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
school they would qualify if they lived
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
in a district not NE necessarily going
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
to school there just living there whose
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
water drinking water exceeds past
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
standards they would qualify if they
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
live in the geographic boundaries of a
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
school who scores in the bottom 10th
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
percentile in standardized testing again
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be going to that
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
school and lastly if they identify as
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
lesbian bisexual gay transgender or
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
non-binary there is nothing in this bill
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
that indicates Ates how several of these
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
categories could even be
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
verified essentially these vague and
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
wide ranging categories make this a
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
universal Statewide voucher program for
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
children 5 to 20 years old and students
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
in their family regardless of
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
income let me say this
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
again while this bill has categories
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
this bill in reality is a universal
 
01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide Voucher Program
 
01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
if a school district or an area has high
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
P fast levels in the drinking water
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
maybe the real answer is not an EFA for
 
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
one student but finding out the source
 
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
of the contamination and using money to
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
clean up the situation to have clean
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
drinking water for all the people and
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
students in that area let's be real who
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
has not been concerned about catching a
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
common cold or the flu or other
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%

01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
private religious or
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
public children are bullied in school
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
for a lot of reasons including being
 
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
lesbian gay transgender bisexual or
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
nonbinary this bill is disguised as
 
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
helping students who may identify as
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
lgbtq by allowing parents to use funding
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
not help but just make things worse
 
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
private and religious schools are not
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%

making sure all our neighborhood public

pull vulnerable students out of public
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
make funding more Equitable stop passing

open up an opportunity and will allow

the ultra wealthy in our state who do
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
not need the state's help to send their
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
kids to these schools and at the same
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%

unverifiable vague category for
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility this EFA will rapidly become

an unchecked Universal voucher system
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
that will be very costly to costly State
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
obligation and an equally costly burden
 
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
for the 165,000 public school students
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
their parents and local taxpayers I urge
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
you to vote no so another motion can be
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.470 align:start position:0%
 
call

01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
Sweeny thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues I stand before you all
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
today as the proud product of New
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public schools in fact
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's no way I'd be standing here and
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
speaking at this well without the public
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
schools uh in my town of Salem New
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that got me here today and and
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
unlike many uh I had a very different
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
experience through the public school
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
system uh that that has really given me
 
01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:25.639 align:start position:0%
the ability to speak uh when I say that
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
when I was four years old I could
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
effectively pronunciate just 27 words I
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
had to go through three years of
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
extensive extensive speech therapy
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
through the Salem School District
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
through the seed program in order to get
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
to where I am today I haven't stopped
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
talking uh since that point where they
 
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
got me up to speed with my peers but
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
that is my background and that's why I'm
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
so passionate about education because it
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
is the dis the Difference Maker between
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
a life where you cannot be heard to a
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
life in which you can be heard now the
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
public schools worked for me and I know
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
the public schools work for countless
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
others but there are still those that
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
the public schools do not work for and
 
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
that is what this bill is about those
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
marginalized communities within our
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that the public schools
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
cannot serve properly that is why we are
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
pushing forward with this bill we've
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
heard uh conversations about communities
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
within our state I was pleased to see uh
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
through text messaging uh the mayor of
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
Berlin supporting this bill uh and
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
supporting all of our bills today to
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
expand educational freedom in our state
 
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
by expanding opportunity to these
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
marginalized communities within the
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we are expanding
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
our educational options the choices that
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
we can provide families and children
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
that need our help this is still public
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
money going towards education at the end
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the day we are investing in the
 
01:25:54.109 --> 01:25:54.119 align:start position:0%
future of the grand State uh and by
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
passing 1561 which expands coverage to
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
those marginalized communities that are
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
are they may not feel safe in their
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
public school they may not feel that the
 
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
school is accommodating to their needs
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
what they need to do it allows that
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
family the flexibility regardless of
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
other circumstances to make the
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%

inuring thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:28:25.709 --> 01:28:25.719 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill allows
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility for a $5,000 voucher and I
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
quote from the Blue Calendar they are
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about attending school that
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
could Le lead to the spread of the
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
common cold or seasonal flu which by the
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
way happens when you live in New
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the winter I would highly
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
call these marginalized students and if
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
I know that public schools lose 5,000
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
,000 vulture students also lose taxpayer
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
money which have been used to improve
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
public school for
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
$65,000 other students and finally if I
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
know that many $5,000 voucher students
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
who may be
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
lgbtq and who may not get accepted to
 
01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
these private schools because of that I
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
would ask now that you vote by pushing
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%

01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
that opportunity for every child if I
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
know that hb1 1561 will ensure that our

introduced in
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
2021 it was advocated as a poverty
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
program to assist families under the
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
300% poverty level it was later amended
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
to 350% on the poverty level this bill
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
will would eliminate any family income

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
requirement it would expand the EFA
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
program to any family with no
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
limitations whatsoever of their family
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
income a family income of
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
$500,000 annually would have the same
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
status as a family income of
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 there is an indeterminable
 
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
physical impact on our state budget
 
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
should this become
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
law now this is problematic since we are
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
currently operating under a state budget
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
with no anticipated options on how to
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%

little is known or anticipated on how

the increase on this funding would
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
impact the availability of state aid to
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
your public school frankly this bill is
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
fiscally irresponsible and is an
 
01:36:37.119 --> 01:36:38.510 align:start position:0%
fiscally irresponsible and is an
unfunded

01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
mandate the EFA program is new three
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
years old the state is currently
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
conducting an audit of this program
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
seeking to find its Effectiveness and
 
01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:52.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal integrity
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
to expand the program now is premature
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
until the findings of the state audit
 
01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.310 align:start position:0%
until the findings of the state audit
are

01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
analyzed you have to keep in mind that
 
01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
the EFA program has no
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
guardrails currently is it a $60 million
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
program administered through a new
 
01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:11.109 align:start position:0%

york-based
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
organization under this bill any student
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
would qualify for an EFA Grant 87% of
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
the students who currently take
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of the EFA program were
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
already in private or religious schools
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
consequently public tax dollars has gone
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
to support students already attending
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
independent private and religious
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
schools only a very few students
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
currently in public schools left and
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
took advantage of the EFA
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
program further there is little
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
accountability to the effectiveness of
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer money on the use of EFA
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
grants we don't know the success of EFA
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
students we have no test scores Etc the
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
universally expanding this program makes
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
the program vulnerable to fraud and
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
abuse this is what happened in Arizona
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
when they moved to a universal program a
 
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
similar Pro a similar bill was recently
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
introduced to the conservative Texas
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
Republican legislature and it was
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
rejected just as I hope we should do
 
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
today remember this bill is contrary to
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
the stated purpose of the program an
 
01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:27.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity for lower income families
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
and students to receive
 
01:38:32.109 --> 01:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
fisal assistance in their education
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
outside the public schools this bill
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
violates the intent of the program and
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
expands it with no safeguards to its
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
management and the fiscal
 
01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:45.159 align:start position:0%
irresponsibility of the taxpayer's money
 
01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues I urge you to vote no on the
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
o2p motion so an alternative itl motion
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%

legislators first oh and I would like to
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
call first I feel the need to rebut some
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
of the things that were said
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
um I was there when this bill was
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
introduced when the original law was
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
introduced and it was it was introduced
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
at with no cap there were States all
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
over watching because we had no
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
cap unfortunately some deals were made
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
in order to get it passed and they did
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
put a cap on it but the idea that it was
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
always meant
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
as a um only for poor kids is is not
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
accurate at all the original Bill had no
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
cap it was always intended to be for
 
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
every single student in the
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
state the next is no accountability no
 
01:40:11.159 --> 01:40:11.950 align:start position:0%

01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
important that we do it without

01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
students one of the things we know and
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
that we're taught as teachers is that
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
not all students learn the same in fact
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
the Nea has an ad that says that every

child you is unique and learns
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
differently but by saying that kids have
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
to attend this school by this ZIP
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
code in effect we're discriminating
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
against the kids who can't learn in that
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%

every kid has to have an education yes
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
we want education for all kids and then
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
they add in the public schools in the
 
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
public schools every kid needs to be
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%

schools that is
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against those kids for

whom it doesn't
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
work I was sitting in a senate hearing
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
and a mom sitting next to me began to
 
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
vibrate as she's listening to the
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%

schools and finally she said what are my
kids

01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
garbage she was so upset the idea that
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
only those kids in the public schools
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
are valuable only they deserve a good
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
education and the kids for whom that
 
01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't work who cares we don't care we
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
don't need to fund them we don't need to
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
make sure they get a good education and

01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker good morning
 
01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues if I know that we should not
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
expand an over budget fledgling program
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
before the performance audit is
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
completed and reported and if I know
 
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
that our constituents do not want to pay
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
private school tuition for wealthy
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
students nor pay for just anything at
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
all and if I know that New Hampshire
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
statute prohibits unfunded mandates and
 
01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:26.229 align:start position:0%

most
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
importantly if I know that I was elected
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
to use taxpayer dollars wisely and that
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state budget cannot
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
afford a universal education grant
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
program would I now make the fiscally

responsible choice and press the red
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%

01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that our
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
award-winning efficiently run EFA
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
program is popular but an income cap is
 
01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.709 align:start position:0%
program is popular but an income cap is
suppressing

01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
suppressing
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
participation if I know that in states
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
that have a universal program 10% of
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
students or less participate and studies
 
01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.830 align:start position:0%
students or less participate and studies
show

01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
show
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
that public school outcomes improve with
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
education freedom because of
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
competition if I know that this will
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
save taxpayers money because the local
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
portion of what is spent per student
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
will stay with the
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
district and most
 
01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
importantly if I know that every child
 
01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
is unique and learns differently and we
 
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
should cherish that
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%

luno thank you Mr
 
03:13:11.630 --> 03:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
Speaker last spring the income
 
03:13:13.950 --> 03:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the education Freedom
 
03:13:17.229 --> 03:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
account program was raised to 350% of
 
03:13:19.630 --> 03:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty level and that's
 
03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
right around
 
03:13:23.110 --> 03:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
$19,000 for a family of
 
03:13:27.389 --> 03:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
four and with this in place the ETF the
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
E EFA program now serves approximately
 
03:13:30.479 --> 03:13:32.429 align:start position:0%
E EFA program now serves approximately
4,200

03:13:32.429 --> 03:13:32.439 align:start position:0%
4,200
 
03:13:35.070 --> 03:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
students but the fact is that most of
 
03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
these students weren't seeking freedom
 
03:13:39.150 --> 03:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
from their Public Schools they were
 
03:13:41.950 --> 03:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
already attending private schools and
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
this bill increases the income threshold
 
03:13:49.110 --> 03:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
again and would fund tuition
 
03:13:51.630 --> 03:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh would fund a t tuition
 
03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program for nearly 78% of
 
03:13:58.309 --> 03:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
the students across our state at a cost
 
03:14:02.190 --> 03:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
of nearly $45 million a year New
 
03:14:04.670 --> 03:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers can't afford
 
03:14:07.150 --> 03:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
this we're just now starting to be able
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
to analyze the data from three years of
 
03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
the EFA program has been around let's
 
03:14:16.269 --> 03:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
not take on an additional $45 million a
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
year in new cost until we have a better
 
03:14:21.389 --> 03:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
handle on how this program is
 
03:14:23.150 --> 03:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
working it's
 
03:14:25.590 --> 03:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
unaccountable there's no academic
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
standards the member want suspend for a
 
03:14:31.469 --> 03:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
minute it's too loud in here if you have
 
03:14:33.429 --> 03:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation take it out in
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
the aning room members have a right to
 
03:14:35.520 --> 03:14:36.630 align:start position:0%
the aning room members have a right to
be

03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
heard thank you Mr Speaker and we just
 
03:14:42.269 --> 03:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
can't afford it please vote no on the
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
most motion of ought to pass so that an
 
03:14:47.229 --> 03:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
alternate motion can be made thank you
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker and I request a roll call
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr Speaker um let me
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
start by saying I second the uh call for
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote uh because I think that
 
03:15:07.469 --> 03:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
um everyone in New Hampshire needs to
 
03:15:10.670 --> 03:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
see the people who are standing up for
 
03:15:13.630 --> 03:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
the best education possible for every
 
03:15:15.590 --> 03:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
every New Hampshire child that's what
 
03:15:19.229 --> 03:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
this is about we saw the kids outside
 
03:15:22.349 --> 03:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
today um I couldn't help but notice the
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
smiles on their
 
03:15:26.110 --> 03:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
face Smiles because they were out of
 
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
school no Smiles because they have
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
Choice they're getting the education
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
that they need and I couldn't help but
 
03:15:34.870 --> 03:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
think of the quote from an ancient Greek
 
03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
philosopher who said the mind is not a
 
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
vessel to be filled but a fire to be
 
03:15:45.110 --> 03:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
kindled that's what this is about too
 
03:15:48.189 --> 03:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
often kids are stuck in a school
 
03:15:52.510 --> 03:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
assigned to them by their address where
 
03:15:55.469 --> 03:15:55.479 align:start position:0%
they're getting their minds filled but
 
03:15:57.469 --> 03:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
no fires are being
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
kindled we lock kids into artificial
 
03:16:03.070 --> 03:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
boundaries for the school that they can
 
03:16:05.469 --> 03:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
attend unless you have the financial
 
03:16:08.110 --> 03:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
means to
 
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
move and I've count countlessly read
 
03:16:12.040 --> 03:16:13.309 align:start position:0%
move and I've count countlessly read
about

03:16:13.309 --> 03:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:16:16.110 --> 03:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh moms who have used different
 
03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
addresses so that they can send their
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
kid to a better school and do you
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
believe that there have been moms
 
03:16:26.309 --> 03:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
sentenced to jail for lying about the
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
address so they can get their kid into a
 
03:16:30.510 --> 03:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
better school how can we let that happen
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:16:34.870 --> 03:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
country the answer is education
 
03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
freedom but in New Hampshire education
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
freedom is limited by a family income
 
03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
cap that has the
 
03:16:46.590 --> 03:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
change we also heard this morning about
 
03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:47.429 align:start position:0%
change we also heard this morning about
the

03:16:47.429 --> 03:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:50.910 --> 03:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
myths associated with school choice
 
03:16:53.950 --> 03:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
programs the myth of
 
03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
accountability school choice programs
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
have the best form of accountability
 
03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
parents can walk if they're not happy
 
03:17:03.910 --> 03:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
with their kids' education in public
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
schools what happens if a school is
 
03:17:08.790 --> 03:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
failing they get more
 
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
money we heard about money being taken
 
03:17:15.990 --> 03:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
from public schools because of the EFA
 
03:17:19.630 --> 03:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
program name me one school in this state
 
03:17:21.790 --> 03:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
that has not gotten the money that they
 
03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
have been promised under our state law
 
03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
you can't do
 
03:17:30.229 --> 03:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
it this increase in the Family Inc cap
 
03:17:30.239 --> 03:17:31.710 align:start position:0%
it this increase in the Family Inc cap
to

03:17:31.710 --> 03:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:17:35.189 --> 03:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
500% uh will increase the cap for a mom
 
03:17:38.110 --> 03:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
and her her child to about
 
03:17:40.469 --> 03:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
$91,000 per
 
03:17:42.870 --> 03:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
2022 guidelines
 
03:17:44.830 --> 03:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
and isn't it interesting to note that
 
03:17:49.389 --> 03:17:49.399 align:start position:0%
the family median income for 2022 was
 
03:17:49.399 --> 03:17:51.790 align:start position:0%
the family median income for 2022 was
87,500

03:20:21.469 --> 03:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
03:20:25.469 --> 03:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that HB
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
1665 would increase the EFA family
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
income eligibility from
 
03:20:35.110 --> 03:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
$115,000 to
 
03:20:40.750 --> 03:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
$150,000 if I know that 1665 expends the
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
expands the initial intent of the EFA
 
03:20:46.710 --> 03:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
initiative as a positive program and
 
03:20:48.990 --> 03:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that the current state
 
03:20:52.870 --> 03:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
budget is established and it is fiscally
 
03:20:55.429 --> 03:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
irresponsible to add an additional
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
funding obligation beyond the current
 
03:21:02.429 --> 03:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
$60 million devoted to the program if I
 
03:21:05.590 --> 03:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
know this Mr Speaker would I now vote no
 
03:21:07.309 --> 03:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
03:21:11.309 --> 03:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
665 OTP motion and press the red button
 
03:21:13.990 --> 03:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
so that alternative motion can be made
 
03:21:15.229 --> 03:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker CH recognize representative lad
 
03:21:19.950 --> 03:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you very much Mr
 
03:21:25.510 --> 03:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know those who oppose
 
03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
school choice often claim that efas
 
03:21:32.910 --> 03:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
siphon tax uh pay payer money from
 
03:21:36.030 --> 03:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools however if I
 
03:21:39.469 --> 03:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
also know that's rarely true Choice
 
03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
programs such as efas cost less per
 
03:21:44.910 --> 03:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
child than the average cost of a per
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
pupil attending a local public school
 
03:21:50.469 --> 03:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
your local school if I know that school
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
choice increases competitive pressure on
 
03:21:55.590 --> 03:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
public schools and reflects better test
 
03:21:58.469 --> 03:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
results in States having flexible
 
03:22:01.950 --> 03:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
learning options such as efas would I
 
03:22:05.229 --> 03:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
then support expanding the EFA program
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%

ner thank you Mr
 
03:24:35.150 --> 03:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker electric vehicles or EVS require
 
03:24:37.950 --> 03:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
rare earth metals to operate to
 
03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
understand what this means we must first
 
03:24:41.590 --> 03:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
understand what rare earth metals are
 
03:24:44.910 --> 03:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
are they are found in low concentrations
 
03:24:47.590 --> 03:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
meaning that they're more difficult to
 
03:24:50.269 --> 03:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
acquire than other metals and even more
 
03:24:52.070 --> 03:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to separate from each other
 
03:24:54.990 --> 03:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
and from the ores in which they occur
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
that means that the circumstances
 
03:24:58.590 --> 03:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
surrounding rare earth metals create
 
03:25:01.309 --> 03:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
difficulty in mining and refining them
 
03:25:03.750 --> 03:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
this presents real real world problems
 
03:25:06.189 --> 03:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
related to environmental damage
 
03:25:08.670 --> 03:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
sustainability and the labor used to
 
03:25:12.349 --> 03:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
procure such labor intensive products
 
03:25:14.349 --> 03:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
The Mining and refining of these Metals
 
03:25:16.429 --> 03:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
is most frequently done at the hands of
 
03:25:19.630 --> 03:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
forced labor in the worst cases among
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
children in China and in the Democratic
 
03:25:26.309 --> 03:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
Republic of the Congo at this time China
 
03:25:28.750 --> 03:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
has a dominant hold on the market with
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
60% of Global Production and 85% of
 
03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:33.910 align:start position:0%
60% of Global Production and 85% of
processing

03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
processing
 
03:25:36.389 --> 03:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
capacity furthermore the Democratic
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
Republic of the Congo was the world's
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
largest Cobalt Miner in 2020 with a
 
03:25:46.269 --> 03:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
production of 95,000 tons nearly 41% of
 
03:25:47.550 --> 03:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
the world's
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
Cobalt while these destinations seem so
 
03:25:52.830 --> 03:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
very far from New Hampshire these issues
 
03:25:55.790 --> 03:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
are very real and present for us while
 
03:25:57.790 --> 03:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
our actions to resolve these problems
 
03:26:01.189 --> 03:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
are limited we can start here at home by
 
03:26:03.790 --> 03:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the procurement of EVs and
 
03:26:05.189 --> 03:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
the prohibiting and prohibiting the
 
03:26:07.469 --> 03:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
government contracts procuring EVS that
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
may have been made through forced labor
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
We are following suit with Federal
 
03:26:13.269 --> 03:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
guidelines and using the power of New
 
03:26:15.950 --> 03:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's purse to lead with a clear
 
03:26:18.750 --> 03:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
conscience the policy proposed by House
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 1580 is not overly complicated it
 
03:26:24.429 --> 03:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
would simply require that any Electric
 
03:26:27.389 --> 03:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Manufacturer provide sworn
 
03:26:30.910 --> 03:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
certification that consents to personal
 
03:26:32.790 --> 03:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction by the state over the
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and certifies that no
 
03:26:36.790 --> 03:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
entity involved in the production of the
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
EV or components for sale used Force
 
03:26:41.870 --> 03:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
labor or child labor through through its
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
procurement the forces of the free
 
03:26:45.910 --> 03:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
market will absolutely mold around
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
legislation such as this and Market
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
competitors will have no trouble
 
03:26:52.229 --> 03:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
adhering to a very small and simple
 
03:26:54.910 --> 03:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
stipulation that could save people and
 
03:26:56.990 --> 03:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
children at the end of the day there is
 
03:26:59.070 --> 03:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
no price too high for the prevention of
 
03:27:01.550 --> 03:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
child or slave labor and the United
 
03:27:04.030 --> 03:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
States specifically New Hampshire can
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
and should be a leader in the abolition
 
03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
of forced labor and child slavery
 
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
wherever it exists and that is why I
 
03:27:14.389 --> 03:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill and even if I'm the
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%

electric vehicles containing components
 
03:27:38.830 --> 03:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
created to the to the use of forced
 
03:27:41.950 --> 03:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
labor so we looked at what those
 
03:27:46.189 --> 03:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
components used produced by forced labor
 
03:27:49.630 --> 03:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
and I agree with um
 
03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
my colleague from miramac in that
 
03:27:57.750 --> 03:27:57.760 align:start position:0%

Toops mobile phones flat screen TVs and
 
03:28:18.389 --> 03:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
any Touch button Appliance so for that
 
03:28:20.830 --> 03:28:20.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
03:29:52.309 --> 03:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
if I know what this bill does is simply
 
03:29:54.510 --> 03:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
say that if the government buys an
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle the manufacturer of the
 
03:30:00.070 --> 03:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle has to certify that no entity
 
03:30:02.429 --> 03:30:02.439 align:start position:0%

03:30:05.110 --> 03:30:05.120 align:start position:0%

CAC r113 which was against slavery in
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it's time to
 
03:30:17.790 --> 03:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
put these words into actions Mr speaker
 
03:30:20.349 --> 03:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
so if I believe that I will fight I
 
03:30:22.229 --> 03:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
believe we could fight slavery all over
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
the world and push the red button and so
 
03:30:38.830 --> 03:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%

Maguire for parliamentary inquiry thank
 
03:30:47.790 --> 03:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker if I know that the Edna
 
03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
committee has already sent to interim
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
study a bill regarding government
 
03:30:56.229 --> 03:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
purchase of electrical vehicles and if I
 
03:31:00.030 --> 03:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
know that these materials are used in
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
many components not just electrical
 
03:31:05.710 --> 03:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles and we are concerned that the
 
03:31:08.750 --> 03:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
government purchasing is being
 
03:31:12.910 --> 03:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
used in the guise of of working against
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
slavery or Force labor to prohibit
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
something that is of concern to many
 
03:31:23.830 --> 03:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
people and if I know that we don't want
 
03:31:26.349 --> 03:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
to burden our municipalities or our
 
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
state with trying to obtain impossible
 
03:31:33.630 --> 03:31:33.640 align:start position:0%

Ardent Sportsman and thanks to the
 
03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
lengthy archery season I get to hunt
 
03:34:07.269 --> 03:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
over 40 days a year predominantly in New
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so keeping Land open to
 
03:34:12.110 --> 03:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
hunting is very important to me
 
03:34:14.309 --> 03:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
hunting is popular across New Hampshire
 
03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
including Suburban areas with higher
 
03:34:18.349 --> 03:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
population densities in the Southern and
 
03:34:21.189 --> 03:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
Eastern portions of the state hunters in
 
03:34:23.429 --> 03:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
these areas frequent uh frequent mixed
 
03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
use areas such as Town Forest and
 
03:34:28.110 --> 03:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
conservation land which are shared by
 
03:34:30.189 --> 03:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
bikers dog walkers and
 
03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
hikers it's common for hunters to use
 
03:34:35.469 --> 03:34:35.479 align:start position:0%
the same Trails for axis and even hunt
 
03:34:37.110 --> 03:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
within a couple hundred yards of
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
people's homes living in New Hampshire
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
living in Nashville
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
I frequently hunt similar locations in
 
03:34:48.389 --> 03:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
pelum Hudson marac Hollis and Brookline
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
for safety firearm hunting has long been
 
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
limited to shotguns and pistols in these
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
areas from Brookline to summersworth
 
03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
since these have limited trajectories
 
03:35:00.189 --> 03:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
compared to classic deer rifles deer
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
hunting rifles in 2021 this was expanded
 
03:35:05.349 --> 03:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
to include three large caliber lever
 
03:35:08.710 --> 03:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
action rifles with Sim similar
 
03:35:10.630 --> 03:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
characteristics this bill will drama
 
03:35:12.550 --> 03:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
rically increase the types of rifles
 
03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
allowed in these shared spaces in two
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
ways the calibers or the size of bullets
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
allowed and the action or the method for
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
loading subsequent rounds this includes
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
the introduction of semi-automatic
 
03:35:27.710 --> 03:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
rifles which fire rounds as fast as the
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
trigger is squeezed taken together this
 
03:35:32.790 --> 03:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
will allow the use of AR style carbines
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
for hunting in these communities I am
 
03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
not opposed to these firearms and have
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
many close friends who own them they are
 
03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
legal for hunting in other areas of the
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
state where there is ample open space in
 
03:35:49.349 --> 03:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
more dedicated Wildlife Management areas
 
03:35:51.870 --> 03:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
however these military look Firearms
 
03:35:55.469 --> 03:35:55.479 align:start position:0%
will raise alarm to the large percentage
 
03:35:57.750 --> 03:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
of non-hunting public who share these
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
areas the committee heard testimony
 
03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
about calls from concerned homeowners
 
03:36:04.510 --> 03:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
about gunshots near their homes and
 
03:36:06.150 --> 03:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
occasionally stray bullets even hit
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
homes during hunting season the presence
 
03:36:11.070 --> 03:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
of AR style rifles will will further
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
raise tensions between hunters and
 
03:36:15.389 --> 03:36:15.399 align:start position:0%
non-hunters and result in more land
 
03:36:17.550 --> 03:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
closed to hunting by
 
03:36:19.630 --> 03:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities Fish and Game opposed
 
03:36:22.110 --> 03:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
this bill for similar reasons in that
 
03:36:24.389 --> 03:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
regard this is actually an anti-hunting
 
03:36:26.830 --> 03:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
bill I urge you to stand with Hunters
 
03:36:29.189 --> 03:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
seeking to keep public land open to
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
hunting by voting against the otpa
 
03:36:34.830 --> 03:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
motion so a better motion can be made
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I ask for a
 
03:36:36.239 --> 03:36:37.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I ask for a
division

03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:36:45.189 --> 03:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:47.469 --> 03:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I hope everyone can
 
03:36:47.479 --> 03:36:48.389 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I hope everyone can
hear

03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
hear
 
03:36:51.790 --> 03:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
me this bill is a simple expansion on
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that we passed several years
 
03:36:56.469 --> 03:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
ago that allowed for the use of a lever
 
03:37:00.150 --> 03:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
action carbine chambered in 357 44
 
03:37:02.830 --> 03:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
magnum and 45 Long cult in areas that
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
were designated shotgun and uh handgun
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
hunting only it's a safety issue we were
 
03:37:09.870 --> 03:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
able to prove that the ballistics
 
03:37:12.510 --> 03:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
although they remain the same uh the the
 
03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
bullet itself was far more accurate when
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
able to be handled through a uh long gun
 
03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
such as a lever action
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
carbine this bill simply expands the
 
03:37:26.110 --> 03:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
list of the acceptable actions to be any
 
03:37:27.790 --> 03:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
rifle which means that now you can have
 
03:37:30.630 --> 03:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
a brake open single shot you could have
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
a pump action you could have a bolt
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
action uh although the previous speaker
 
03:37:38.550 --> 03:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned an AR I'm not aware of any AR
 
03:37:39.750 --> 03:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's chambered in a straight wall
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
pistol cartrid if you want to prove me
 
03:37:44.189 --> 03:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
wrong I i' be happy to listen to that
 
03:37:46.590 --> 03:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
but uh the end result is that an AR does
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
not make a p a pistol or a pistol
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
cartridge more powerful because of the
 
03:37:53.150 --> 03:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
platform in fact an AR diverts part of
 
03:37:55.349 --> 03:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
the gases to actually work the mechanism
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
and it ends up being less powerful
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
so the the straight walled pistol
 
03:38:03.189 --> 03:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
cartridge expansion of the calibers that
 
03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
I can explain to you now was actually
 
03:38:08.070 --> 03:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
the language that I got from the chief
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer Fish and Game
 
03:38:13.870 --> 03:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
the current law as we passed it has been
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
so popular that they've had non-stop
 
03:38:18.750 --> 03:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
calls from Hunters that are looking to
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
try to use their pistol cartridges in a
 
03:38:25.469 --> 03:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
long gun so that they have more accuracy
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
and and less stray bullets and
 
03:38:30.990 --> 03:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
whatnot in addition fish and game has
 
03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
determined that this is actually a good
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
control mechanism for those high density
 
03:38:36.070 --> 03:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
areas where we've had trouble
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
controlling the deer population and
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
there's been a higher incidence of deer
 
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
ticks and Lyme disease
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
so allowing for more methods to be able
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
to take care of that herd makes sense
 
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
and and to allow those Hunters to have
 
03:38:50.910 --> 03:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
more opportunity to use their guns makes
 
03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
sense and on top of that a lot of the
 
03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
people we found that are opting for this
 
03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
happen to be
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
females or youth who are just getting
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
into hunting and who cannot handle a
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
modern shotgun Which is far more
 
03:39:06.189 --> 03:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
powerful than any of these rifles we're
 
03:39:08.590 --> 03:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the modern
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
shotgun uh is extremely powerful and the
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
ballistics are far above anything that
 
03:39:16.510 --> 03:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
was previously contemplated in what most
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
rifles do um to be able to handle a gun
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
that is a rifle but chambered in a
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
handgun round which is going to be
 
03:39:27.550 --> 03:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
straight walled so it is less
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
powerful is a perfect introduction to
 
03:39:32.590 --> 03:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
hunting for a female or
 
03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
Youth and it is a perfect way to expand
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
this in those areas where we need to be
 
03:39:40.830 --> 03:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
able to control the deer herd so I would
 
03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
look forward to you helping me support
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation that came out
 
03:39:47.710 --> 03:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
bipartisan from the committee with a
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee vote green on
 
03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%

03:41:11.710 --> 03:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
the motion before for us is UT to pass
 
03:41:13.750 --> 03:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
as amended on House Bill
 
03:41:18.870 --> 03:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
order this will be a roll call vote
 
03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Harvey
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%

03:41:34.349 --> 03:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
Speaker I can't see with these things Mr
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that fish and game
 
03:41:40.269 --> 03:41:40.279 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill because municip IP
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
alties should be able to determine the
 
03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
firearms that are used for hunting in
 
03:41:45.439 --> 03:41:46.229 align:start position:0%
firearms that are used for hunting in
their

03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
communities and Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
that this bill would allow the use of AR
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
style rifles in town forest and
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
conservation land in very densely
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
populated areas of the state and if I
 
03:42:04.590 --> 03:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
know that it is easy to convert an AR to
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
a straight walled pistol two examples
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
are the 10 mimet and 45 ACP
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that this bill
 
03:42:16.030 --> 03:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
could lead to conflicts between hunters
 
03:42:16.040 --> 03:42:17.309 align:start position:0%
could lead to conflicts between hunters
and

03:42:17.309 --> 03:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
non-hunters which would result in more
 
03:42:23.910 --> 03:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
public land being closed to hunting and
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
thus this is an anti-hunting bill would
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
I now press the red button to oppose the
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended motion so that
 
03:42:36.950 --> 03:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
a better motion can be made thank you Mr

03:42:54.910 --> 03:42:54.920 align:start position:0%

Weber thank you Mr
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker colleagues it's important to
 
03:50:00.189 --> 03:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
know what this bill
 
03:50:04.110 --> 03:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
does the bill restricts simultaneous
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
employment for any employee of
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
DHHS and forbids them from
 
03:50:14.189 --> 03:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
simultaneously working for an adoption
 
03:50:18.550 --> 03:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
agency so why is this a problem it's a
 
03:50:22.510 --> 03:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
problem on a lot of levels first off
 
03:50:24.790 --> 03:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
most of the employees at
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
DHHS have nothing to do with child
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
placement and therefore we should not be
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
putting any obstacles in their way of
 
03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
doing whatever they want to do on the
 
03:50:41.710 --> 03:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
time that they are not employed by
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
DHHS so that's number
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
one number
 
03:50:54.269 --> 03:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
Services Division of Youth and Family
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
Services yes
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
dcyf is the agency specifically charged
 
03:51:06.429 --> 03:51:06.439 align:start position:0%
with the overseeing of children who are
 
03:51:09.790 --> 03:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
the victims of abuse and neglect
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
so here's what happens we had somebody
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
implying that dcyf employees were
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
handing off children to adoption
 
03:51:24.630 --> 03:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
agencies for
 
03:51:29.070 --> 03:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
money that is an appalling
 
03:51:32.349 --> 03:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
assertion M susp the member will
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
suspend state state your point of order
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
my point of order is that the speaker
 
03:51:38.750 --> 03:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
that the current Speaker is implying
 
03:51:38.760 --> 03:51:40.550 align:start position:0%
that the current Speaker is implying
motive

03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
motive
 
03:51:42.750 --> 03:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
on the bill by saying that people are
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
stating what was spoken in our committee
 
03:51:49.149 --> 03:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
by a person it was just what was stated
 
03:51:50.750 --> 03:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
in committee
 
03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative point of order is taken
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
continue so here's what happens when
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
there is an abuse and neglect
 
03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
petition first off there is a yearlong
 
03:52:10.590 --> 03:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding of about the abuse and
 
03:52:13.229 --> 03:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
neglect that's happened and during that
 
03:52:17.349 --> 03:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
year the sole
 
03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
goal of DCF is reunification of the
 
03:52:25.710 --> 03:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
family we want to put children and their
 
03:52:28.189 --> 03:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
families back together and strengthen
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
their families if we
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
can at the end of a whole
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
year if the child cannot be safely
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
reunified with their family
 
03:52:43.110 --> 03:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
there is a new proceeding called a
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights that the
 
03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to counsel the
 
03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to appeal that is a
 
03:52:55.469 --> 03:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
fully contested new
 
03:52:58.830 --> 03:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding and it is not until after
 
03:53:00.510 --> 03:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
that proceeding has happened the
 
03:53:03.429 --> 03:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
decision has made and all appeal rights
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
exhausted that an adoption proceedes
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
there is no adoption agency involved the
 
03:53:16.870 --> 03:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
adop the dcyf stays with that child
 
03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
until they are
 
03:53:22.309 --> 03:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
safely either adopted by a new family or
 
03:53:24.990 --> 03:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
placed under guardianship or have
 
03:53:29.469 --> 03:53:29.479 align:start position:0%
another successful safe
 
03:53:32.670 --> 03:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
outcome so this bill is a problem in
 
03:53:34.370 --> 03:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
search of a
 
03:53:34.380 --> 03:53:36.349 align:start position:0%

solution
 
03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:40.309 align:start position:0%
solution
the

03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
the other concern with the bill was that
 
03:53:48.110 --> 03:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
it might have forbidden been construed
 
03:53:50.349 --> 03:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
to to have
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
forbidden um anybody in DCF to be a
 
03:53:56.110 --> 03:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
foster parent but you took care of that
 
03:53:58.149 --> 03:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
with the amendment so that's not a
 
03:53:58.159 --> 03:54:00.030 align:start position:0%
with the amendment so that's not a
problem

03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:54:04.229 --> 03:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
but the underlying problem that the bill
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
seeks to address does not exist as far
 
03:54:11.149 --> 03:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
as we know there are not and never have
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
been any DCF workers who also work for
 
03:54:18.910 --> 03:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
adoption agencies and there is no reason
 
03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
to limit anybody else because there's no
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
possibility of any conflict of interest
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
on anybody else in
 
03:54:33.389 --> 03:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
DHHS so I urge you to vote down the a to
 
03:54:36.910 --> 03:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
pass so that another motion can be made
 
03:54:39.750 --> 03:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
and we can get on our way thank you
 
03:54:46.149 --> 03:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%

03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
there's never been an
 
03:54:56.590 --> 03:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
issue um and something along the lines
 
03:54:59.070 --> 03:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
of a a of a solution in search of a
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
problem that was what was quoted in the
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
calendar for those who want to read the
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill in its entirely entirety is amended
 
03:55:07.149 --> 03:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
is on the last page it's a total of two
 
03:55:10.750 --> 03:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
lines long what this bill does is create
 
03:55:13.830 --> 03:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
guard rails to make sure that no one
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
could ever be accused of trying to move
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
a child from one family to
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
another having been through the process
 
03:55:26.510 --> 03:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
once before of of being accused I I have
 
03:55:28.110 --> 03:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
an intimate
 
03:55:30.870 --> 03:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
familiarity with some of what happens
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
within state government not by my choice
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
but because I loved my
 
03:55:39.149 --> 03:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
children in this case I also heard a
 
03:55:42.030 --> 03:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
number of other families who were
 
03:55:45.550 --> 03:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
suddenly um in the Limelight relative to
 
03:55:47.790 --> 03:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
DCF and they were concerned that there
 
03:55:50.189 --> 03:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
might be some mixed motives this would
 
03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
be an easy way to prevent that
 
03:55:54.030 --> 03:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
appearance of evil to make sure there
 
03:55:57.710 --> 03:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
motives let me tell you a story several
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
years ago I heard I heard of a a great
 
03:56:04.510 --> 03:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
analogy relative
 
03:56:07.269 --> 03:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
to to do the right
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
thing a dad was trying to hire a
 
03:56:13.550 --> 03:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
chauffeur to take care of his elderly
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
mom something that's appropriate he had
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
three applicants he challenged the
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
applicants to drive up a very difficult
 
03:56:22.910 --> 03:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
Road I think the Mount Washington
 
03:56:24.590 --> 03:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
Highway is a good
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
example and he challenged him to find
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
out how close they could get to the edge
 
03:56:31.710 --> 03:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
on the way up and the first guy oh I can
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
do this no problem I can be within 12
 
03:56:35.550 --> 03:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
Ines of the edge all the way up the hill
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
I I'm a very good
 
03:56:39.710 --> 03:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
driver second one said I can do better
 
03:56:41.910 --> 03:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
than that I can be within an
 
03:56:43.990 --> 03:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
eight and the third one said I'm not
 
03:56:45.710 --> 03:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
going to be anywhere near the edge
 
03:56:47.870 --> 03:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's not good for your
 
03:56:50.149 --> 03:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
mom that's what we're talking about here
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about making sure there's
 
03:56:53.870 --> 03:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
policies in place to protect the family
 
03:56:56.349 --> 03:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
at all costs it's not about how close we
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
can come to the issue of having a child
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
mov from one family to another we should
 
03:57:05.469 --> 03:57:05.479 align:start position:0%
have all the appropriate guard rails to
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%

removed from their families
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
because of abuse and neglect and who are
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
unable to be reunified with their
 
03:58:47.790 --> 03:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
families never go to an adoption agency
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
they are adopted from DCF into their new
 
03:58:56.349 --> 03:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
families and if I know that the guard
 
03:58:59.550 --> 03:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
rails that are already in place is the
 
03:59:03.469 --> 03:59:03.479 align:start position:0%

03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:59:28.830 --> 03:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
that we should be happy that this has
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
not been a problem in the past but if I
 
03:59:33.510 --> 03:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
know that it is our job to put in guard
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
rails to protect children to make sure
 
03:59:39.149 --> 03:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
that there will be no confusion as to
 
03:59:41.469 --> 03:59:41.479 align:start position:0%
where a child is placed after being
 
03:59:44.550 --> 03:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
removed from their family and if I
 
03:59:46.750 --> 03:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
understand that this is just a common
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
sense idea that shouldn't need to be law
 
03:59:52.830 --> 03:59:52.840 align:start position:0%

this bill essentially does is put

Hampshire now you may be asking yourself
 
04:26:51.189 --> 04:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
what is
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
geoengineering well it's a set of
 
04:26:58.269 --> 04:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
certain measures using specific
 
04:26:58.279 --> 04:27:00.750 align:start position:0%
certain measures using specific
technology

04:27:00.750 --> 04:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
to offset the negative impacts of
 
04:27:06.269 --> 04:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
climate change well that doesn't sound
 
04:27:08.830 --> 04:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
so bad does
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
it does it have something to do with
 
04:27:14.590 --> 04:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
reducing our greenhouse gas emissions no
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't does it have anything to do
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
with capturing our greenhouse gas
 
04:27:23.229 --> 04:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
emissions no does it have anything to do
 
04:27:26.189 --> 04:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
with removing the greenhouse gases that
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
we currently have in our atmosphere it
 
04:27:31.790 --> 04:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
does not the methods that I'm referring
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
to are specifically
 
04:27:34.920 --> 04:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
to are specifically
designed

04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%

04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
to create a global cooling
 
04:27:43.870 --> 04:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
effect by spraying the atmosphere with
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
aerosolized particles in order to block
 
04:27:49.389 --> 04:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.399 --> 04:27:51.149 align:start position:0%
 
Sun

04:27:51.149 --> 04:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
Sun
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to speak on what's
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
currently going on in our atmosphere oh
 
04:27:59.229 --> 04:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
he's he's talking about chemtrail that's
 
04:28:01.469 --> 04:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
that's complete conspiracy that's not
 
04:28:03.189 --> 04:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
going on that's never
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
happened fine let's let's let's say it
 
04:28:05.640 --> 04:28:06.950 align:start position:0%
happened fine let's let's let's say it
has

04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
I have here in my hands federal
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines a federal framework plan to
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
implement such
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
measures it's
 
04:28:23.309 --> 04:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
entitled congressionally mandated
 
04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
research plan and an initial research
 
04:28:28.590 --> 04:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
governance framework related to solar
 
04:28:28.600 --> 04:28:31.269 align:start position:0%
governance framework related to solar
radiation

04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
04:28:33.429 --> 04:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
modification and
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
specifically in this plan
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
they talk about the use of stratospheric
 
04:28:39.960 --> 04:28:41.670 align:start position:0%
they talk about the use of stratospheric
aerosol

04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
aerosol
 
04:28:43.469 --> 04:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
injections which is pretty much a
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
classier term for chemtrails but don't
 
04:28:49.149 --> 04:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
you dare say Chemtrails you got to use
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
the the correct
 
04:28:55.109 --> 04:28:55.119 align:start position:0%
term and so I'm going to read a few
 
04:28:58.269 --> 04:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:02.670 --> 04:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
document so starting quote this document
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
focuses on atmospheric based approaches
 
04:29:06.910 --> 04:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
to solar
 
04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
radiation modification otherwise known
 
04:29:09.760 --> 04:29:10.590 align:start position:0%
radiation modification otherwise known
as

04:29:10.590 --> 04:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:29:15.109 --> 04:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
SRM specifically stratospheric aerosol
 
04:29:18.990 --> 04:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
injection well how is this going to be
 
04:29:21.870 --> 04:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
implemented from the document quote
 
04:29:24.429 --> 04:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
instrumented aircraft
 
04:29:28.710 --> 04:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
platforms airplanes perhaps and aerosol
 
04:29:31.630 --> 04:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
or aerosol precursor injection systems
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
would be needed in both s and MCB MCB is
 
04:29:39.070 --> 04:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
another method Marine Cloud brightening
 
04:29:44.910 --> 04:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
um it looks to um have have the same um
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
goals back to the document for sa
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
experiments of interest is how aerosols
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
are formed and involved in real
 
04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
Stratosphere in response to the
 
04:29:57.269 --> 04:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
injection of aerosols or aerosol
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
precursor gases for example sulfur
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
dioxide now according to the CDC sulfur
 
04:30:08.830 --> 04:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
dioxide is a toxic
 
04:30:11.910 --> 04:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
chemical it's severely irritating to the
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
eyes mucous membranes skin respiratory
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
tract inhalation exposure to very low
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
concentrations of sulfur dioxide can
 
04:30:24.750 --> 04:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
aggravate chronic pulmonary diseases
 
04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
such as asthma and empyema oh that
 
04:30:29.070 --> 04:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
sounds great well I'm really looking
 
04:30:30.750 --> 04:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
that and they also mention a variety of
 
04:30:35.870 --> 04:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
aerosol materials could be examined so
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
what other chemicals are they thinking
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
atmosphere back to the document quote
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic and ecological outcome
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
decisions concerning whether and how to
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
deploy SRM should be based upon an
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of the risks and benefits
 
04:30:58.030 --> 04:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
to human health and well-being of its
 
04:30:59.910 --> 04:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
implementation relative those
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
anticipated under the current climate
 
04:31:04.590 --> 04:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
change traj trajectory so what that
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
means is look at away your health risks
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
versus the risks of climate
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
change right and so hey if if it
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
produces negative side effects to human
 
04:31:17.710 --> 04:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
health well you know what it's for the
 
04:31:23.710 --> 04:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.269 --> 04:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
then it goes on quote Research into the
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
human dimensions of SRM impacts to date
 
04:31:34.750 --> 04:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
has been ad hoc and frag fragmented as
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
needed and kind of pieced here and there
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
rather than being the product of a
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive strategy as a result
 
04:31:44.670 --> 04:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
substantial knowledge gaps and
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
uncertainties exist in many critical
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
areas research to understanding the
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
potential nature magnitude and
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
distribution of SRM impacts on
 
04:31:58.109 --> 04:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
ecosystems human health and well-being
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
political and economic systems and other
 
04:32:02.469 --> 04:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
issues of social concern does not
 
04:32:05.630 --> 04:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
currently provide a sufficient basis for
 
04:32:07.030 --> 04:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
supporting informed decisions with
 
04:32:09.750 --> 04:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
regard to SRM solar radiation
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
modification implementation so they even
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
tell you they don't really know what the
 
04:32:17.309 --> 04:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
potential out uh outcomes are going to
 
04:32:20.950 --> 04:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
be and the potential uh negative
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
impacts they to uh they do to a degree
 
04:32:25.600 --> 04:32:27.309 align:start position:0%
impacts they to uh they do to a degree
are

04:32:27.309 --> 04:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:32:29.790 --> 04:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
assuming is going to be health
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
risks uh the report goes on to say how
 
04:32:34.510 --> 04:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
SRM could increase the risk of exposure
 
04:32:37.550 --> 04:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
to particular ulates accelerate ozone
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
depletion worsen soil acidity affect
 
04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
crop yields and negatively impact
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
ecosystems but hey a after all this is
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
for you know this is for to lessen the
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
impacts of climate
 
04:32:55.750 --> 04:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
change currently New Hampshire has no
 
04:32:58.990 --> 04:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
protections in place to prevent these
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
kind of radical
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
measures and I for one don't want my
 
04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
children to be exposed to this or your
 
04:33:10.429 --> 04:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
grandchildren it it sounds to me and you
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
and you can look at this document
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
online all right it's it's it's widely
 
04:33:21.150 --> 04:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
available they want to treat us like Lab
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
Rats and experiment on us with this
 
04:33:24.520 --> 04:33:27.150 align:start position:0%

plan

04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:33:30.789 --> 04:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
um yes the
 
04:33:33.070 --> 04:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
bill um it's it's going to be tough to
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
police these kinds of things
 
04:33:38.830 --> 04:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
but having a plan in place is better
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
than having no plan in place so I urge
 
04:33:44.670 --> 04:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
you please vote against the itl motion
 
04:33:44.680 --> 04:33:47.869 align:start position:0%
you please vote against the itl motion

preconception ctions of me as a person
 
04:34:39.470 --> 04:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
and open up its mind on this issue for
 
04:34:40.709 --> 04:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
the sake of our
 
04:34:44.189 --> 04:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
world Bill Vander Zam the premier of

but as so many of his constituents were
 
04:34:53.189 --> 04:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
contacting him about what they were
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
seeing in the skies he filed the foyer
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
request with the Canadian federal
 
04:34:59.070 --> 04:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
government he received a largely
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
redacted answer but still contained
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
within those documents were admissions
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
the government of Canada is aware of
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
this technology and that they refer to

opinion on geoengineering was quoted as
 
04:35:22.230 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
saying quote I think it's one of the
 
04:35:24.269 --> 04:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
most dangerous diabolical things that's
 
04:35:25.910 --> 04:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
ever happened to us it's the most
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing short of a nuclear
 
04:35:30.510 --> 04:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
cataclysm so I take it very very
 
04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
seriously and will do everything I can
 
04:35:35.310 --> 04:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
to try and expose this problem end quote

unfortunately will likely not be able to

convince my colleagues here to support

overturning the committee's
 
04:36:13.109 --> 04:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this bill but I do
 
04:36:15.150 --> 04:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
hope after hearing short bits from the
 
04:36:17.029 --> 04:36:17.039 align:start position:0%
testimony of decorated servicemen from
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
the United States and Canada and my
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
testimony here today that I am able to
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
get them to start asking questions there
 
04:36:26.109 --> 04:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
are many PhD level biologists
 
04:36:27.551 --> 04:36:27.561 align:start position:0%
environmental scientists and other
 
04:36:29.709 --> 04:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
highlevel experts that have equally as
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
powerful testimony I urge you to do the
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
research take the time to look into this
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
pass a 90c Google Search and understand
 
04:36:40.990 --> 04:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
that people in power
 
04:36:43.869 --> 04:36:43.879 align:start position:0%
lie I won't harp on this any further and
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
i' would like to end with a quote from
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
our former president Linder ban Lynden
 
04:36:50.029 --> 04:36:50.039 align:start position:0%
Baines Johnson when speaking at a
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
graduation ceremony about new the new
 
04:36:55.230 --> 04:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
technologies of the new age quote it
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
lays the predicate and the foundation
 
04:37:00.269 --> 04:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
for a weather satellite that will permit
 
04:37:03.470 --> 04:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
man to determine the world's Cloud layer
 
04:37:07.070 --> 04:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
and ultimately to control the weather
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
and he who controls the weather controls
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
the world thank you Mr
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr Speaker I think
 
04:37:24.189 --> 04:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
you'll all be happy to know I'm not here
 
04:37:26.109 --> 04:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
to debate the merits of this bill and
 
04:37:28.590 --> 04:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
the philosophy behind it but just what's
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself and why I feel it
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
simply is not passable or imple
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
implementable in its form
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'll give you a few examples I won't
 
04:37:38.551 --> 04:37:38.561 align:start position:0%
read them all because it would take too
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
long it starts out with all one
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
statement All State climate related
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
appointees must have administered some
 
04:37:47.949 --> 04:37:47.959 align:start position:0%
oath we don't know what a State climate
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
related appointee is it's not defined I
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
have no idea what they are another
 
04:37:54.310 --> 04:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
sentence the Department of Environmental
 
04:37:56.029 --> 04:37:56.039 align:start position:0%
Services shall refer potential
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
violations as reported by state agencies
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
of members of the public to the New
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire County Sheriffs and the
 
04:38:04.070 --> 04:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services Air
 
04:38:06.510 --> 04:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
Services Resources Division well I would
 
04:38:07.869 --> 04:38:07.879 align:start position:0%
think the Department of Environmental
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
Services would know which of their
 
04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
subgroups to report it to I.E air
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
resources but why the New Hampshire
 
04:38:16.990 --> 04:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
County Sheriffs they show up all over
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
this bill and the county sheriffs have
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with monitoring air
 
04:38:22.590 --> 04:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
pollution they don't have the technology
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have the Manpower and they
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have the resources or
 
04:38:27.390 --> 04:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
the budget to do it yet they're in this
 
04:38:29.470 --> 04:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
bill multiple times giving
 
04:38:31.109 --> 04:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do things that they
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
simply couldn't
 
04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
do another section it goes on talk about
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
if some of these things that the
 
04:38:38.349 --> 04:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
previous speakers were just talking
 
04:38:42.789 --> 04:38:42.799 align:start position:0%
about uh s cloud seating Etc uh were
 
04:38:45.150 --> 04:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
detected and a member of the public
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
produces evidence to the department or
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
again to the New Hampshire County
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
Sheriffs that the activity may be
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
harmful or involves a release of
 
04:38:54.670 --> 04:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
pollution emissions a ceased and assist
 
04:38:57.470 --> 04:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
order shall be issued well that's like
 
04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
saying to a police officer someone told
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
me a person was doing something harmful
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
so I arrested him what's harmful it's
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
not Define
 
04:39:07.949 --> 04:39:07.959 align:start position:0%
it's not defined here as what is harmful
 
04:39:09.510 --> 04:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
or involves releasing pollution
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
emissions I've been involved with
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
environmental law quite a bit over the
 
04:39:15.150 --> 04:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
years and normally what's done there is
 
04:39:17.789 --> 04:39:17.799 align:start position:0%
you say you cannot release any more than
 
04:39:20.670 --> 04:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
so many parts per million of X Y and Z
 
04:39:23.230 --> 04:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
you just don't say something is harmful
 
04:39:26.310 --> 04:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
or may be harmful or involves re release
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
of polluting emissions anything that
 
04:39:30.189 --> 04:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
gets release could be classified as a
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
polluting emission and it goes on like
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
this another place it says an activity
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
deem hazardous by the Department of
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services boy talk about an
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
open book for a state agency we want
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
state agencies to be out there saying we
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
deem something is wrong therefore we're
 
04:39:47.788 --> 04:39:47.798 align:start position:0%
going to go after you legally of course
 
04:39:49.750 --> 04:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
not you want to know exactly what it is
 
04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
you did and what the standard was used
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
to determine something was wrong and
 
04:39:56.430 --> 04:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
like I say this bill goes on for pages I
 
04:39:59.310 --> 04:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
won't it simply is not written well it's
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
can't be implemented and I urge you to
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
04:42:36.510 --> 04:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
government has framework in place to
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
spray our
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
atmosphere you can look into it with
 
04:42:44.110 --> 04:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
stratospheric aerosol
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
injections sulfur dioxide base and other
 
04:42:50.670 --> 04:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
chemicals and if I know this will have
 
04:42:50.680 --> 04:42:51.948 align:start position:0%
chemicals and if I know this will have
negative

04:42:51.948 --> 04:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
negative
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
impacts on plant growth our
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
ecosystem food
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
production and if I also know that
 
04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
blocking out the Sun
 
04:43:08.190 --> 04:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
will negatively reduce the energy that
 
04:43:13.868 --> 04:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
technology and if I lastly Mr
 
04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that New Hampshire has
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
no safeguards in place to prevent
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
anything like this in the state of New
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would I now press the red
 
04:43:31.230 --> 04:43:31.240 align:start position:0%

the following resolution resolved that
 
04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%

04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
Kofa thank you Mr speaker it's been a
 
04:51:06.788 --> 04:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
long day so I will keep this short you
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
may wonder why I put my name on removing
 
04:51:12.868 --> 04:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
this bill from consent when the vote was
 
04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
17-2 and the short answer is that I
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
believe that some very legitimate issues
 
04:51:19.868 --> 04:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
were raised we had a lot of people come
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee and testify that they
 
04:51:24.910 --> 04:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
felt that there were things about the
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
the fishing game license the fishing
 
04:51:29.830 --> 04:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
game guide licensing process that need
 
04:51:33.070 --> 04:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
further review I also know that the the
 
04:51:35.070 --> 04:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
committee chair has already done some
 
04:51:37.948 --> 04:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
followup and I deeply appreciate that
 
04:51:40.350 --> 04:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
having said that I believe that a more
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion for this bill would
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
be interim
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
study therefore I am asking
 
04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully that you vote against the
 
04:51:52.110 --> 04:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
itl so that we may bring a motion of
 
04:51:54.190 --> 04:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
interim study forward thank you Mr
 
04:52:00.030 --> 04:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.510 --> 04:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
explain thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
members uh uh the majority of the
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee found that this was not a
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
valuable uh or necessary Bill uh
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
although as the previous speaker stated
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
we did find that there was a lot of
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
valid areas where we could follow up
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
fishing game is already doing so one of
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
the areas where fishing game said that
 
04:52:23.470 --> 04:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
we needed to uh that that we said that
 
04:52:26.670 --> 04:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game was lacking in in their uh
 
04:52:29.070 --> 04:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
forthrightness in this process was that
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
there was no sample testing online for
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
anyone to see what the the oral part of
 
04:52:35.708 --> 04:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
the exam would would entail we have
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
gotten an agreement from Fish and Game
 
04:52:39.310 --> 04:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
and they are currently posting onto
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
their website uh one of the retied
 
04:52:43.628 --> 04:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
questions that they no longer use so
 
04:52:45.150 --> 04:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
that somebody can see a sample question
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
of what will it will entail and they can
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
study against
 
04:52:51.628 --> 04:52:51.638 align:start position:0%
that we also found that there was a lack
 
04:52:54.070 --> 04:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
of flexibility in the oral part of the
 
04:52:56.910 --> 04:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
testing for uh those who learn with
 
04:52:59.310 --> 04:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
different abilities uh everyone was
 
04:53:01.070 --> 04:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
basically made to go through the same
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
oral testing process without any
 
04:53:02.958 --> 04:53:04.590 align:start position:0%
oral testing process without any
accommodation

04:53:04.590 --> 04:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
04:53:06.310 --> 04:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
however I directed the fish and game
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
department to work with Frank edbl from
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to modify
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
and pro produce accommodations so that
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
somebody who learns differently can
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
still take the guides oral exam and
 
04:53:21.990 --> 04:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
pass given those areas that were
 
04:53:24.910 --> 04:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
addressed this bill is no longer
 
04:53:27.190 --> 04:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
necessary even if it were to pass the
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
way it's written doesn't solve the
 
04:53:30.230 --> 04:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
problems that the sponsor wanted to
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%

04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns about the process
 
04:54:59.948 --> 04:54:59.958 align:start position:0%
uh and that an interim study motion may
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate would I then press
 
04:55:04.270 --> 04:55:04.280 align:start position:0%

04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker uh Mr
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that during the
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee hearings there was no direct
 
04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
evidence provided that having a guide on
 
04:55:25.110 --> 04:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
this board has caused the purposeful
 
04:55:27.788 --> 04:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
failing of an applicant and if I also
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
know that most boards and commissions do
 
04:55:30.910 --> 04:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
include a member of the licensed
 
04:55:33.548 --> 04:55:33.558 align:start position:0%

04:55:35.628 --> 04:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
the assessment of
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
applicants and if I further know that
 
04:55:39.000 --> 04:55:40.110 align:start position:0%

applicants can have a chance to study a
 
04:55:52.548 --> 04:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
test that has been used in the past and
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
I will say that they have already done
 
04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%

04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%

04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
where I'm at finally Mr Speaker I would

what we say before the Full House

state's
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
finances and there is good news and bad
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
news the good news is revenues have been
 
05:02:11.310 --> 05:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
um moderately higher than expected so we
 
05:02:14.830 --> 05:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
are in good shape where that goes um
 
05:02:16.750 --> 05:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
Although our two biggest months of
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue are still in the future that's
 
05:02:22.830 --> 05:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
March and April the bad news is that if
 
05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
you add up all of the fiscal notes for
 
05:02:30.070 --> 05:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
all, plus bills in the house and the
 
05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
Senate it comes to 2. $3
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
billion so and I'm just as guilty of
 
05:02:41.548 --> 05:02:41.558 align:start position:0%
this as as others but if you have
 
05:02:44.350 --> 05:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
sponsored bills that have fiscal notes
 
05:02:45.430 --> 05:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
and spend
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
money I I just want to warn you to be
 
05:02:49.548 --> 05:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
