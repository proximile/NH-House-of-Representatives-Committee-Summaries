00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone we'll uh begin the
 
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill 300.
 
00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the disposal of certain food
 
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.290 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the disposal of certain food
waste

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
waste
 
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
I do see uh Mike wimset here you know
 
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
I'll yield to the sponsor whether
 
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
there's someone that she'd like to call
 
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
on or
 
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr chair so there
 
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
are two folks here today that are
 
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 align:start position:0%
interested in speaking that I'm aware of
 
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
one is here to represent the New
 
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire food bank and the other is to
 
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
represent Waste Management so I don't
 
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
know what your pleasure is who you'd
 
00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 align:start position:0%
like to call first whoever you think
 
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
would be the most effective
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
they would be equally effective so um
 
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
have I
 
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
i o has another engagement he has to get
 
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
so for the division if you could just
 
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
state your name and I'm sure the prime
 
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
sponsor knows how to spell it so
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Henry vayu and
 
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of Waste Management
 
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh they operate uh one of the state's
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
largest uh landfill
 
00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 align:start position:0%
in Rochester the turkey landfill
 
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
Steve pudgy who's the area director of
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
disposal operations I wanted to be here
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
this morning but he couldn't ask me to
 
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
come in his place
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
Steve serves on the solid waste working
 
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
group with representative Ebel and
 
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
they've been working for over a year
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
almost two years on the issues and food
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
waste has come up
 
00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
waste has come up
um

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
and I think it was mentioned at the
 
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
hearing that EPA estimates that about 21
 
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 align:start position:0%
percent of Municipal Solid Waste
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
is food waste and the thing about food
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
waste is it it really doesn't need to go
 
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
in a landfill when we think about what
 
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
we want to put in landfills we want to
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
put things in landfills that really
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's no other use for it
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
and with food waste there are so many
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
other beneficial reuses for it
 
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.610 align:start position:0%
other beneficial reuses for it
um

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 align:start position:0%
the thing about uh
 
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
diverting food waste though is that it's
 
00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 align:start position:0%
kind of a chicken and an egg thing
 
00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:28.850 align:start position:0%
kind of a chicken and an egg thing
um

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
the industry is hesitant uh to
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
create the facilities to manage food
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
waste without the demand
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
and without
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
facilities the demand won't be there so
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's kind of this chicken and egg and it
 
00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 align:start position:0%
really takes something to happen to make
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
it all come together
 
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
and in Massachusetts
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
they passed a similar law requiring
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
large generators of food waste to divert
 
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 align:start position:0%
it from landfills
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
and waste management actually opened a
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
facility just outside of Boston it
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
processes 100 tons of food waste a day
 
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
and then they send it up to Lawrence
 
00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:21.770 align:start position:0%
and then they send it up to Lawrence
Mass

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
Mass
 
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 align:start position:0%
where it turns into energy
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
so that certainly is a beneficial reuse
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the material
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
um it didn't happen overnight even after
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
the law passed in Massachusetts it took
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
about two years
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
um for the facility uh to get full at
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
capacity so it's not going to happen
 
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.550 align:start position:0%
capacity so it's not going to happen
overnight

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and I think the approach The
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
Regulators took in Massachusetts was it
 
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
was more of a uh a reminding of the
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
large food waste generators that the law
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
had passed and that they should start to
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
think about and look at the Alternatives
 
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 align:start position:0%
and it also takes a little while for the
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
alternative facilities to
 
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
pop up so it's not something that's
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to occur overnight but it does
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
take that sort of trigger to get it
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
going uh and legislation like this
 
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
certainly would be that trigger that
 
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
could help a lot of again large food
 
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
waste gender and there are
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are some already uh
 
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
diverting the waste Dartmouth uh
 
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh Hospital up in um uh Lebanon is
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
already diverting theirs
 
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so uh I think the large generators
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
are in a in a good position to do it um
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
Hannaford uh which has operation New
 
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh they're doing it up in
 
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.850 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh they're doing it up in
Maine

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
um this is sort of a baby step taking
 
00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
the large generators in Massachusetts
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
they reduced uh below one ton so they're
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
stepping it up a little more down there
 
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
but it does save space in landfills for
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't have ideas for so that's
 
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
all I have to say
 
00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:20.419 align:start position:0%
you take questions sure
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
Senator McGuire thank you do you know in
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts after this bill this past
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
what fraction of um the the input to the
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
landfills went down right so so how much
 
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
less was going into landfills I can find
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
that out and I'll get that to the
 
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.969 align:start position:0%
that out and I'll get that to the
committee

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Weiler
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you do you know if there's a plan
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
to build a composting plan in New
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by your company
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
if this uh passed the company certainly
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
would give it very serious consideration
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
they'd look at obviously there's got to
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
be the volume and it would probably be
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
and obviously Southern
 
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh where a facility I mean
 
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:14.660 align:start position:0%
you'd want Manchester Nashua uh you know
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
Seacoast uh
 
00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.769 align:start position:0%
Seacoast uh
so

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:25.220 align:start position:0%
for other questions
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
represent evil
 
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:28.910 align:start position:0%
represent evil
so

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I have spoke with Mr pogi quite a bit
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
and he is the regional director for
 
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
Waste Management which is basically all
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
of the Northeast and so I just want to
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
re-ask if you would reassert that just
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
as a planning mechanism for landfill
 
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.509 align:start position:0%
as a planning mechanism for landfill
operators

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
operators
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
you feel that you want to keep an eye on
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
preserving capacity for things that
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
really need to be landfilled as opposed
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
to food scraps and that you see this as
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
actually a business opportunity as well
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and we've already taken measures to
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
divert I mean yard waste yard waste is
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
already a Prohibition and I think that
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
used to represent 12 to 15 percent of
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
the waste and uh so that you know this
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
is sort of a The Next Step yeah yeah to
 
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
preserving for the materials as I said
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes represent kimberles
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
the question do you know if the like the
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
facility in Massachusetts is uh is it
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
profitable is it self-sustaining now
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
with what they're getting uh yeah it is
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
now self-sustaining as I said it took
 
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
about two years for that to happen
 
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
um which is interesting I mean a greater
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
Boston area you would think there'd be a
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
lot of food down there but it took some
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
time and it'll take some time up here in
 
00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:02.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but uh I think that's
 
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but uh I think that's
where

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
things are headed you know the whole New
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
England area is starting to do this uh
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
so that company no longer requires
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
subsidies of any sort to maintain it's
 
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
itself uh well we never received any
 
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
subsidies it was a business decision and
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
um I think they saw that over time they
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
could eventually make it work and
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
representative evil and you said that
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
they're producing energy uh so it must
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
be an anaerobic yeah aerobic digester
 
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
yep great great I mean it's certainly
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
so I have a question so for your
 
00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339 align:start position:0%
Rochester facility
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
um how many tons are going in there
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
annually which you have that figure as
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
far as food waste and what capacity
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
Steve would know that it's like
 
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
you want to grab the mic sure
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Mike wimsat I service
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
director of the waste management
 
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
division for New Hampshire Des uh yeah
 
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
we our numbers are the last year that we
 
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.990 align:start position:0%
we our numbers are the last year that we
have

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
reported numbers for the turnkey
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
facility in Rochester it landfilled
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
approximately a million tons of uh of
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
waste in total if you just run you know
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
roughly we generally think about 20
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
percent of the MSW Municipal solid waste
 
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
that goes into a landfill is going to be
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
or food and organic waste so by that you
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
know calculation would be about 200 000
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
tons of the food that went of the waste
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
that went in there would be food waste
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
all right thanks Let's Help
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire has a question
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
but of this 200 000 you don't know what
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
fraction are from the people defined in
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
the bill namely more than a ton a day oh
 
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339 align:start position:0%
is it a week today a week
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
and with with you know recyclers nearby
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of stuff absolutely
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
that that's correct we I'm not
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this bill would reduce
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
the waste going into TurnKey by 200 000
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
tons because it wouldn't it would be
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
some smaller portion of that we don't
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
really yet have numbers on what
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
portion of that of the total waste is is
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
from these large generators
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I suspect you know if you if you I
 
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459 align:start position:0%
have a home compost pile sometimes it
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
feels like I bring a ton a week out to
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
that pile so it's hard to say but
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
um the raccoons like it so it's all
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
right but
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I guess uh it's it's definitely a
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
smaller number than that I would point
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
out Vermont has done a similar program
 
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
which they have phased into basically
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
it's now at a point where it's
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
essentially a ban on Pro a Prohibition
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
on landfilling all food waste so in in
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
Vermont they're they're you know to the
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
point where they've got homeowners
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
either participating in curbside
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
collection in some locations in the more
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
urban locations or they have
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities through the local transfer
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
station or other small composting
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
operations to to send their waste to
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you would this
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
Bill affect my local transfer station in
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe less waste I don't know no
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
I I I don't think it would in in the
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
first instance because you know the way
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
I think we would interpret it it's it's
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
the actual generator of the way so while
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
a transfer station may take in a ton of
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
food waste from its residents in any
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
given week it's not the generator of
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
that waste so I don't think it would
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
impact they don't have to sort or
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
anything no okay and one last question
 
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
what's the duties of the new employee in
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
oh um if if there were a new employee
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
basically what what when we filled out
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact worksheet we what we
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
try to do is you know take a really
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
careful look and say if we're going to
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
do this you know full implementation the
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and a program to do Outreach
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
and education and then compliance
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
assistance and enforcement where
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
necessary we estimated it could take out
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
an FTE I think in practice
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
um what might likely happen is it would
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
be an initial push to do the rulemaking
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
to set up the program some Outreach but
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
then to be candid I think we would take
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
a a you know it's hard to imagine that
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
we would on an ongoing basis contribute
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
um a full FTE to this program I think
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
once it was up and running it wouldn't
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
take that much so if there were position
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
associated with this we we certainly
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
have we've just issued a solid waste
 
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
management plan in September we have a
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
number of implementation actions and and
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
plans and activities for the coming year
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
and then following that we believe that
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
employee would be engaged in many of
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
those those kinds of things
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so I would assume you're like most
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
and you have lots of unfilled positions
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
is that right uh no that that well it
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
depends on which part of the agency
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
um the solid waste program
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
um has all of its positions filled
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
except for one
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
engineer position which still needs to
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
be filled and that's that's a difficult
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
position to recruit for because it's
 
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
hard to recruit engineers at present
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
um and then in the in the coming budget
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
there is an additional position that is
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh um in the governor's budget that
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
that's been submitted to the legislature
 
00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:46.259 align:start position:0%
a lower level program assistant position
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
that would help with
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
um basically a collecting data and
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
managing data that we collect from from
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
from Solid Waste stakeholders so if if
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
we pass the governor's budget and this
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
bill do we have to add another position
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
I I think that you know again we're
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
always very
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
um reluctant to say yeah we can just
 
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
take on anything you give us the reality
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
is we're we've we've got a full plate
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
right now and I'm I want to make sure
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
people know I'm not complaining we've
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
finally gotten the solid waste Bureau to
 
00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339 align:start position:0%
a point after many many years of being
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
under resource where we've got some
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
positions and we're really uh optimistic
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
about the things we're going to be able
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
to do moving forward to catch up with
 
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
our surrounding states having said that
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
new responsibilities like this really do
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
require that we have uh new new blood if
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
you will to help Implement them in the
 
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
in the the initial phase of these things
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
can be very time consuming because
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
you're really starting from scratch
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
you're trying to create a program that
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
we never administered before you've got
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
to do rule making and you've got to do
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
collection of data so you do that
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
rulemaking well and then you've got to
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
do the Outreach once you make the rules
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure people know what it is they
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
need to do to comply all right thank you
 
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.529 align:start position:0%
need to do to comply all right thank you
representative

00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you so this is a little bit of
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
a segue but on the on the planning and
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
technical assistance
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't you say that even though you
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
finally have two people in your planning
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
and assistance and education program
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
with this new Solid Waste Management
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
plan to push forward you really could
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
use additional folks no question about
 
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:28.580 align:start position:0%
that absolutely thank you
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
so I understand there's someone from the
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire food bank here okay if you
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
to come forward and state your name for
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
us and if it's difficult to spell
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
we'll start again Eileen loponis
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
executive director for the New Hampshire
 
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
Food Bank l-i-p-o-n-i-s
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to let you know what
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
food Reclamation means to us and what we
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.570 align:start position:0%
participate in
um

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have very active
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
arrangements with all our grocery
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
partners and we Proclaim if they're
 
00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%
partners and we Proclaim if they're
Salvage

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
Salvage
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
we get it we pick it up but we also
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
enable our agencies and we have 400
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
agencies throughout the state so it
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense for me to send
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
a driver to
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
the Shahs and Colebrook I wish there was
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
one in Holbrook sorry
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
um up there and then back down so we
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
have our agencies that are local we
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
train them in food safety and then they
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
are able to pick up directly from the
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
grocery Partners so we are salvaging
 
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:45.419 align:start position:0%
that food waste throughout the state
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
with our grocery Partners already we
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
have a really great program with them
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
called Fresh rescue where they will
 
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
freeze the protein before it goes out of
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
date and that's the majority of the
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
protein that we use in our production
 
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
protein that we use in our production
kitchen

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
we have a production kitchen that
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
produces approximately five to six
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
thousand meals a week they are at
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
aggregate Hotel pans that serve about 20
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
to 25.
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
we started composting last year in
 
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.330 align:start position:0%
we started composting last year in
February

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
February
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
in in all of 23 we did 10 and a half
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
tons of food waste
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
and you got to understand our our whole
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
place is Reclamation we never know
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
what's coming in the door the chefs go
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
downstairs every day see what looks good
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
our agencies that shop with us if you're
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
within 50 miles of the food bank can you
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
come and you place your order online you
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
have a date a time in 20 minutes to pick
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
up your order which is ready for you and
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
Shop the floor for anything extra that
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.370 align:start position:0%
comes in
um

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's a tremendous amount of food that we
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
are able to bring in from the grocery
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
Partners I can imagine that this would
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
be another source for us I do know of
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
other food banks throughout the country
 
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
that are able to benefit from this type
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
of in our industry it's called
 
00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:57.299 align:start position:0%
institutional Salvage so that would be
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
your hospitals and your universities
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
the biggest portion of actual food
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
Reclamation that comes from those are
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
from your larger cities your Las Vegas
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
your Boston so I think in this instance
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking for mostly
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
composting from our hospitals my sister
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
was a director of sustainability for
 
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
Seattle's children's hospital and she
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
said it for her it was very difficult on
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
the food safety and there's not enough
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
food safety regulations out there as far
 
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned food safety is no hobby
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
we take it very seriously we train all
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
our agencies we train all our partners
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
it just takes one bad case of food
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
poisoning to bring an entire
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
organization and everything with it down
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
so we look to food safety in every
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
aspect of what we do but in Reclamation
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's very tricky as far as temperature
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
control goes so I'm sure there would be
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
food safety regulations that would be
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
followed along with this and we would be
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
happy for anything that could be
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Sweeney all
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
for being here to take questions from us
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
if you were to estimate could you give a
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
number on how much food that's usable
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
and safe that's currently in New
 
00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire going to landfills that your
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
organization could take advantage of
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
well the estimate is that
 
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
40 of everything that's grown produced
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
distributed is wasted
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's globally
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
in the United States I don't have that
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
number on me
 
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.430 align:start position:0%
number on me
um

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
we do the best we can
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
um food safety like I said is not a
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
hobby and we have to take it very
 
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.570 align:start position:0%
hobby and we have to take it very
seriously

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:34.580 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
an estimate for the United States I'd
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
represent people
 
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
so I know I I recently participated in a
 
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
network Cafe for the food rescue
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
Alliance and there was a lot of
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for having access to more
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
food um
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
don't you think in working with
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
additional uh larger generators of food
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
waste you could benefit by getting quite
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
a bit more food I mean assuming that you
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
comply with the safety regulations
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
um absolutely the hospitals will most
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
likely be the ones to have that type of
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
volume and there are recovery programs
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
that exist so that we would definitely
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
be looking to them
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
um to partner with but it would be under
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
all the food safety regulations that we
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
oh okay I'll just that so I just want to

the co-sponsors for this bill and I've
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
been very involved with a couple of
 
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:25.820 align:start position:0%
programs uh in terms of food waste and
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
there is a volunteer non-profit program
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
in Nashua called grow Nashua what they
 
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
do is just to give you some numbers and
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
what kind of waste is generated in
 
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.810 align:start position:0%
what kind of waste is generated in
Nashua

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.590 align:start position:0%
Nashua
um

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's about
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
250 tons a day
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
in Nashua that comes to the landfill
 
00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:57.539 align:start position:0%
which is about 50 ton is Residential
 
00:24:57.539 --> 00:24:59.090 align:start position:0%
which is about 50 ton is Residential
Waste

00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
Waste
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
and if you say 40 percent of 50 ton
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
is food waste
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
you do the math right about
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
40 time I mean about 25 to 30 tons of
 
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
you know at least 20 tons of food waste
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
per day that comes to the landfill so a
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
few years ago uh yeah gentlemen I don't
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
know if he has sent you the information
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
grow Nashua Justin Monroe started this
 
00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:32.179 align:start position:0%
as a pilot
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
and if you go to the thing it's one of
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
the pictures that's my front door where
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
the J you know every Friday
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
there's a pickup they come with this we
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
have green buckets
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
to fill during the week put it out
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
Thursday morning I mean Thursday night
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
they pick it up and just by pre and I
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
pay like 25 30 a month
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
for this service because I don't have to
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
go to a place to dump my waste or save
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
it in my backyard which would be and
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
this is 335 days so all true and I can
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
say over three years
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
um from my bucket that comes I've done
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
more than a ton of waste
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
food waste and they pick up and he sent
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh pulls it together and compost and
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
they're not doing energy and he would
 
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
love to scale up and he has now three
 
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
full-time people that pick up
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
two trucks two and this is and there are
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
five houses out of 36 houses in my
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
neighborhood five houses that
 
00:26:58.930 --> 00:26:58.940 align:start position:0%
participate in it just fine
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
and it's amazing how I fill up this one
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
so when I talk to the landfill folks
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
they said oh this would be a huge you
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
know Nashua has a landfill that has a
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
life for another 50 years but we are
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
filling up very quickly right and this
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
if we can do the compost expand the
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
compost and
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
also add the renewable energy that ways
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
to energy called the plasmogen pyrolysis
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
which you know not just food waste but
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different uh ball game
 
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you the way this has
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
scaled up non-profit is able to generate
 
00:27:44.409 --> 00:27:44.419 align:start position:0%
enough you know donation as well as
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
employee people because
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
the program pays for itself for some of
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
the employees and it's been a wonderful
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
thing and I feel so proud to be able to
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
say you know what
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
I don't put up my trash barrel every
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
week maybe once a month between
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
Recycling and composting I barely put
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
out my big blue barrel for garbage so
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
that's I'm not contributing to the
 
00:28:10.679 --> 00:28:11.750 align:start position:0%
that's I'm not contributing to the
landfill

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
so I would take a look and this is a
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
wonderful addition and I'm sure Mother
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
Earth will smile down on us and say
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony comments
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Weiler
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
your green bucket that you put out to
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
yeah because I see him tearing up
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
plastic bags it's not a bag it's a
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
barrel with a tight lid and so I put it
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
out at night because I forget to put in
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
the morning they you know but they come
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
and they let you know ahead of time I'm
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
glad it works thank you
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
I think representative Weiler has some
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
bears in his neighborhood like I do
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
as much as we say Nashua I have Bobcat
 
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
we have Fox we have bear
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
in Nashville too
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
representative evil I just wanted to
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
point out to the committee that uh grow
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
Nashua did send a letter for the
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
committee and I've distributed it to
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
everybody and there's also let uh
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
letters there from the Northeast
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
resource recycling Association that
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
works with a lot of municipalities in in
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay the division's pleasure with the
 
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.049 align:start position:0%
okay the division's pleasure with the
bill

00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
so my question would be is this better
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
as a standalone bill by itself going on
 
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
to the senate or is it better as a
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
section of House Bill too
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
I would defer to the sponsor which her
 
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
the chair and thank you for the question
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair I think at this point
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
um it would be a great idea to retain
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
the bill within the committee
 
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.210 align:start position:0%
the bill within the committee
um

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to have uh the saw the waste
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
management division here again next week
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
with uh des and then we can talk about
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
it in its entirety okay I'll move to
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
retainment yes okay
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's been moved to retain by
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire seconded by
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt would I get that
 
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.149 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt would I get that
right

00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
all right we'll just have a show of
 
00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419 align:start position:0%
hands I think that'll be easy enough on
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
this those wishing to retain
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
those opposed to unanimous
 
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
so we're right on time thanks guys
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
well I actually do have a minute or two
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
I said well
 
00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:30.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:59.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:32:59.169 --> 00:32:59.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
The Works session on House Bill 462
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
making an appropriation to the solid
 
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
waste management fund Etc representative
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
evil I believe wishes to speak
 
00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I mean I think um
 
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:18.500 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of the arguments in favor
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
of uh composting were made in the in the
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
last hearing this bill HB 462 is a bill
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
that would appropriate
 
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
two million dollars to the solid waste
 
00:33:38.889 --> 00:33:38.899 align:start position:0%
management fund which the house
 
00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:42.539 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh endorsed the passage of
 
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
last year but it remains unfunded
 
00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.090 align:start position:0%
last year but it remains unfunded
um

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.029 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
policy tweak that had it come through
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
Ena and then to us was that in the text
 
00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
because of the emphasis that the solid
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
waste working group felt should we
 
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
should have on compost and I think the
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
Des concurred we wanted to change the
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
language for the grant program to
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
emphasize in the first two years
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
composting so 50 percent of the funds
 
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
would be prioritized for food waste
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
diversion from um from landfills
 
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.089 align:start position:0%
diversion from um from landfills
um

00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:32.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
what I just passed out was a letter that
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
I was asked by the solid waste working
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
group to send to the committee
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
supporting HB 300 HB 462 and then um
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
the ultimately the solid waste
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
management Bureau I have told you before
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
that the solid waste working group is a
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
is a stakeholder group what I did was I
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
gave you the working group member list
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
so you could see that it really
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
represents all walks of life
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I've talked to many folks about this
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh they're really excited from a
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
business standpoint and from um and
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities as you know the New
 
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.349 align:start position:0%
municipalities as you know the New
Hampshire

00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association spoke in favor the
 
00:35:24.849 --> 00:35:24.859 align:start position:0%
last time
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities have an ongoing struggle
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
with their solid waste and they really
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
are excited at the prospect of a grand
 
00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
program like this so I hope we can vote
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
to retain it in the budget question
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you Mr chairman
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so how would this money be spent is
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
this to buy the green buckets to to give
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
out to people or something like that
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
I can see that the uh that the director
 
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
is there I mean I I think that there's a
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
lot of flexibility built into the
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
language to try to help the businesses
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
and towns with their proposals
 
00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:14.810 align:start position:0%
and towns with their proposals
Michael

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
Michael
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
if I may sure Mike wimp said again
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
um what we envisioned for this program
 
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
and again I think the the members know
 
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
that the solid waste management fund was
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
created in the last legislative session
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
but it's yet to be capitalized in any
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
way so there's no no funding in the in
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
um if if funding were provided what we
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
envisioned would be and we have actually
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of experience with this in
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
other related programs we would put a
 
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.099 align:start position:0%
solicitation out for for Grant
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
applications and we expect that we would
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
get significant applications from
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as from private
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
the private sector and the purpose of
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
the grant would basically be to
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
incentivize the development of alternate
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
business models and Technologies for
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
managing food and organic waste so it
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
could be you know someone who wants to
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
set up an anaerobic digestion uh process
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
on their Farm or it could be a transfer
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
station that would say well we we think
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
we could collect and compost food waste
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
from our residents since they're coming
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
here every Saturday anyways
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
um so it could be you know putting in a
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
concrete bunker or something for
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
receiving that and really it would be up
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
to the individual municipality or
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
private sector entity to to determine
 
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
what it is they would need but we would
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
anticipate it would be largely for
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements necessary to uh
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
launch some kind of an effort to divert
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
waste from disposal
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
further question so does either this
 
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
bill or existing law
 
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:49.940 align:start position:0%
put limits or you know
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
so much per Grant fifty thousand is a
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
Max or something like that or I don't
 
00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
believe there's a necessarily been a
 
00:37:59.569 --> 00:37:59.579 align:start position:0%
total ceiling Max established but
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
they've been identified as matching
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
grants which and I'm trying to remember
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it actually specifies
 
00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
50 but when we hear matching grains we
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
usually think they're 50 and and it
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
would depend it'd be competitive we have
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh I said we've done this in other
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
settings with using federal funds that
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
we've received for the brownfields
 
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
program we've done this for 15 years now
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh maybe 20 years we received those then
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
we put out a solicitation and in most
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
cases municipalities
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
um who have identified a property in
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
their in their community that is uh
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
where there are concerns about
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
contamination will apply for a grant
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
um to do site investigation to try to
 
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:41.900 align:start position:0%
position that
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
property for a cleanup so and to try to
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
encourage private investment in
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
purchasing cleanup the property and
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
restoring it to the tax rolls so we're
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
pretty good at administering that kind
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
of a solicitation and Grant the details
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
about you know what a ceiling would be
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
or what the match would be really have
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
not yet been worked out we would likely
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
do that through rulemaking
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah just um do you expect to spend
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
this entire 2 million in this biennium
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
or is and and is this going to become an
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
ongoing request I I would say
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
um I would say if I were to try to
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
prognosticate I think it would be
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
unlikely we would spend that much in
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
grant funding in the biennium because I
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
think first of all it takes some time to
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
set up the program get solicitation out
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
and get the word out and then
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
um you know grants are terrific but they
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
don't make processes work of their own
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
accord we we would be looking at you
 
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
know as we uh as we looked at those
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
grain applications that we would get in
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
a competitive environment we'd be
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
looking for ones that had a business
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
plan and a structure that we thought
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
would be self-sustaining over time we're
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
not looking to be a you know a constant
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
subsidy to these programs we're really
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
looking to incentivize the development
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
of the development of them in the first
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
instance with the idea that the vision
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
that they would survive on their own on
 
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
their own accord and strength in the
 
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.329 align:start position:0%
their own accord and strength in the
future

00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I see that it got amended this this
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
bill got amended by the house and it it
 
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
gives you basically your your division
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh the authorities solicit funds from
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
any Source you know donations grants Etc
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
I know that the budget is really tight
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
we've finally got some Revenue figures
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
so I don't know whether it's likely that
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to get two million dollars
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
this year but I wonder what is the
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
likelihood of you being able to solicit
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
funds from another source
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh it's hard to say I think that there
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
are opportunities out there we were
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
actually hopeful when the fund was first
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
created that we would be able to go
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
after what we knew would be EPA grant
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
funding that was going to be targeted
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
towards Solid Waste for as part of the
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
bipartisan infrastructure law indeed
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
that funding has been appropriated and
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
we are likely to get a grant that will
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
help us to do a number of things related
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
to planning and Outreach but
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately despite our efforts uh
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
significant efforts to try to convince
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
EPA otherwise they didn't get
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea of States
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
getting the scrant money and then using
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
it to make sub grants to municipalities
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
or businesses so we're we're still
 
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
engaged in that debate with them and
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're in their program is evolutionary I
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
guess I would say this they've never
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
made they've never had funding for solid
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
waste before so I I'm as part as a New
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative in my
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
counterparts in the New England states
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the northeast states have been
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
talking with EPA about that and we're
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
hoping that in future years they will
 
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
kind of see that this could be a a
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
productive way to use their funds but to
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
date we don't have the authority to do
 
00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.829 align:start position:0%
date we don't have the authority to do
that

00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
someone a follow-up to representative
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
Griffin's question I see by the fiscal
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
note that about a half a million a
 
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
little more than a half a million would
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for 26 and 27 so maybe if
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
we get the program off we wouldn't have
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
to go for the entire 2 million but
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
something less than that for the at
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
least this this biennium without going
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
to the next biennium I think that's
 
00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.530 align:start position:0%
to the next biennium I think that's
where

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin was probably
 
00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:30.109 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin was probably
headed

00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
headed
 
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
all right anything else Sir Michael
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
see no other questions thanks Mike the
 
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.130 align:start position:0%
see no other questions thanks Mike the
kid

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:39.140 align:start position:0%
kid
 
00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire so uh this seems
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
similar to the previous bill so maybe we
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
should move to retain it as well
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is moving to
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
retain is your second second by
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
we'll just have a show of hands they'll
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
make it easier for our clerk everyone in
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
favor of doing that
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
those opposed it's unanimous thanks
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
for the house it's not new like some of
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
them have been coming to us like the uh
 
01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:15.380 align:start position:0%
docket how the vote went down was it
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
non-recommendation or did it pass
 
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
unanimously and if there was a house
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
so Mike carries a docket with him so we
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
can get a pretty good idea
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
how this is coming to us so we're
 
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
looking at house bill 230.
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
that came out of the executive
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
departments and administration committee
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
ought to pass vote of 18 to nothing
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
so very quickly representative Bixby
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
would you like to
 
01:00:57.059 --> 01:00:58.430 align:start position:0%
would you like to
so

01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand what view of this
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
and so we know we sure we're already
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
here that we've met once on it so we
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good idea we met spoke to
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner of Agriculture it was
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
obviously supportive
 
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
so um last time I sort of talked about
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
how I came to put this in at this point
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
I just want to talk about the
 
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
ramifications So currently in the
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.010 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
Foods

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
Foods
 
01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.339 align:start position:0%
nothing is automated uh there is uh so
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
everything that gets submitted to the
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
department has to be uh entered uh the
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
the data entry is still by hand using
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
basically 1980s technology
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
it will save you a lot of testimony
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
because that's what we heard from the
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner when he was here to speak
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
to it so okay explain it was I guess
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
someone involved that was actually
 
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
incarcerated that came up with a plan
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
initially and that person is no longer
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
around and that was quite an interesting
 
01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
story right so um I just want to point
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
out that this is this is basically every
 
01:02:05.339 --> 01:02:06.670 align:start position:0%
out that this is this is basically every
single

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
operation that the department does that
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
is using
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
way outdated technology and it is
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a waste of Department
 
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
resources to have skilled people doing
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
data entry when they could be actually
 
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
doing the things that are they're
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing under statute like
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
assessing uh the uh assessing fertilizer
 
01:02:30.059 --> 01:02:30.829 align:start position:0%
assessing uh the uh assessing fertilizer
um

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
composition like making sure that
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
pesticides are being applied
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
appropriately one of the things with
 
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
pesticides is that the reporting for
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
pesticide use is now annual so a
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
pesticide company will keep a list of
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
what they have been spraying for a year
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
and then send that in that's not really
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
useful it was useful if there's an issue
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
with spray drift you want to be able to
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
track that pretty quickly so if they
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
were able to if the pesticide
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
applicators were able to
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
submit what they had sprayed
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
immediately after they sprayed it which
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
would probably be more convenient for
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
the applicators too then that would give
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
us a essentially an up-to-date current
 
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
set of data in case there's a issue that
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be tracked down this same
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
problem can be sort of
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
there are analogous issues with every
 
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
single licensing and Reporting uh part
 
01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
of the the activity that goes on in the
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
department including weights in my
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
including weights and measures which is
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
basically making sure that consumers are
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
getting a fair uh you know the the what
 
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
what they're buying is actually reported
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
fairly so um with that I'll I'll take
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none I believe oh I'll ask so it
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm in favor of improving technology
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
Etc the main thing about this one is the
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
the ongoing costs feels very high 200
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
000 a year of Maintenance that's like
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
two people right so yes and but if you
 
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
consider that currently
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
most of the employees in the department
 
01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:21.980 align:start position:0%
are doing that work if you
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh then you are getting an immense
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
savings by reducing it to the cost of
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
effectively two people the other thing
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
is that uh that the registration and
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
Licensing fees that the department
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
brings in
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
will be sufficient to cover that ongoing
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
cost uh so it's just a matter of doing
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
getting over the initial hump of getting
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
it set up and when the commissioner said
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to ask for 360
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
000 I thought wow that's cheap so
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
further questions so so next time we'll
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
you'll have to talk and talk to the
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner about that one all right so
 
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'll move to retain I think this is a
 
01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:08.339 align:start position:0%
worthwhile thing and we need to put it
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
in the budget thank you
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay it's been moved by representative
 
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:17.540 align:start position:0%
McGuire's second by representative
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
Griffin okay I thought I heard something
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
over there
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
um all right now just a show of hands I
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
believe should be sufficient those favor
 
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
those opposed all right we'll retain
 
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
this and try to find a place for it in
 
01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:40.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
I see something that should an item that
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take too much time uh
 
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
hopefully house built 347 the
 
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
establishing of a superior court land
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
and would just get a little history from
 
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman
 
01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of the Judiciary
 
01:06:04.619 --> 01:06:07.010 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of the Judiciary
Committee

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment
 
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.170 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment
of

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
a vote of 16 to 4.
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
and it was adopted on the floor by Voice
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative Lynn
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I uh come
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
before you in support of of the bill I
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
um I did have should note I did have
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
some discussion with uh representative
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
McGuire who suggested that
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
um the the appropriate way to handle
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
this since the Judiciary in its budget
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
has included the judge position uh you
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
know that would that would Encompass the
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
land use Docket in its budget that the
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate way for this committee if
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
you're so inclined to handle this would
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
be to retain the bill and put the uh and
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
put the language of of HB 347 into the
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
into hb2 and then include the the money
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
in the budget so that that makes perfect
 
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:12.059 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
01:07:12.059 --> 01:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
sense to me
um

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
anyone may have
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
signal questions I'll accept emotion
 
01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:24.299 align:start position:0%
from representative Griffin I think Mr
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I moved to retain the
 
01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:28.730 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I moved to retain the
bill

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
um Second and it's second is its
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGuire so
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Lynn
 
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
um the one sentence so essentially we
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
would be copying part one of your bill
 
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:44.579 align:start position:0%
into House Bill 2 but the one sentence I
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
would think of removing is
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
um on line 30 of page
 
01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.950 align:start position:0%
um on line 30 of page
uh

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
I don't see any page one I guess
 
01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:58.630 align:start position:0%
I don't see any page one I guess
um

01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.569 --> 01:08:02.579 align:start position:0%
yeah right well it's just that the third
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
um nothing in this section shall affect
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
current jurisdiction of the housing
 
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
appeals board so
 
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm personally thinking about that we
 
01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.789 align:start position:0%
um I'm personally thinking about that we
should

01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
um remove the housing appeals board
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
because they haven't been used very much
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
um as a as a way to save some money so
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if I took out that
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
sentence and and force those things into
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
this well I guess what I I mean to be
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
completely candid with you that that was
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
an amendment that was put in at the
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
suggestion of the ranking member of the
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee of Representative
 
01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.910 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee of Representative
Smith

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
um who felt very strongly that
 
01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:50.590 align:start position:0%
um who felt very strongly that
um

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
that the housing appeals board was
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
important and that it should remain in
 
01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.289 align:start position:0%
important and that it should remain in
effect

01:08:57.289 --> 01:08:57.299 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and candidly I you know my my sense
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
was that even if that language hadn't
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
been in there that that nothing in this
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
bill would remove the housing appeals
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
board nothing in the bill itself
 
01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:08.809 align:start position:0%
board nothing in the bill itself
um

01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
and I guess what I would what I would
 
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
say is is this I I know that different
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
people have different feelings on the
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
um it act the the issue of the housing
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
appeals board I should say actually
 
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
became an issue in my campaign for
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
re-election and which caused me
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
to you know to really sort of delve into
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
because that the the housing appeals
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
board was was adopted before I ever
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
before I was ever elected to the
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
legislature so it actually caused me to
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
to say you know I really ought to look
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
at this
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and so I read at what was at that
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
time you know in October or November of
 
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
of 2022 every decision that had been
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
rendered by the housing appeals board
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
because it had been claims made that
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
well you know this this board is just
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
designed to be sort of a pass-through
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
for developers they're reversing every
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
decision of local planning and planning
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
boards and I have to say my sense of
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
have from having read every decision was
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
that they really weren't you know making
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
off-the-wall decisions my I did a fair
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
amount of of these kind of appeals when
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
I was a superior court judge and earned
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
a few and quite a number on appeal when
 
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
I was on the Supreme Court and my sense
 
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
was as a general matter
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
that the housing appeals board came to
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
the same decision that a superior court
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
judge would have come to effect you know
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
maybe taking a a bit long a fair amount
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
of time longer but that their decisions
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
were not off the wall uh in any sense so
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to imply that at all so
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
what we are concerned with on this
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
committee and your former member is
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
value for money and the bear facts are
 
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
that the housing appeals board in two
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
years handled 65 cases
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
and judge NATO said to us this judge
 
01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:02.780 align:start position:0%
will handle 200 such cases in one year
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
and in half time and the other half time
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
will be doing standard Superior Court
 
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
cases you see what I mean no no I do I
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
do too I know I do I do assume you I
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
mean I guess all I wanted I just wanted
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
to further for for the benefit of
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I just wanted
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
you to understand sort of the history of
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
this I
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
I am certainly in favor of whatever
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
system will provide the most efficient
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
way to handle these cases in the you
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
know in the in the least amount of time
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
and if that if if this committee
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
believes that that the way to do that is
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
to just have the Superior Court land you
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
stock it
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
um that you know that that's fine with
 
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
um that you know that that's fine with
me

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's that is a a policy move
 
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
which we try to avoid right
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
um and before we make such a move
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
we have some things like performance
 
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.130 align:start position:0%
we have some things like performance
audits

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
audits
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
and we could request performance audit
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
and have them contrast the two systems
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
and and bring us back the sort of data
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
that that uh
 
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn mentioned to see
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
what's the efficiency and what are we
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
getting and how much is it costing in
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
each and that would be a good thing
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
before we'd make such a a move because I
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
remember we talked about it for a couple
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
years before we brought in the housing
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
appeals board and there was a lot of
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
support for it and so it if if you uh
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
just summarily dismiss it at this point
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
as a financial situation you'd be in a
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
big trouble I think so it's better it's
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
better to deal with the policy situation
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
and at least if we're going to make any
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
move to eliminate something have some
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
real data that we can look at and say it
 
01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
costs so much to do the court the thing
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
here and so many delays and here's
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
here's what happened in the court and if
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
it turns out that the rumors we were
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
told it took three years to get to court
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
and they did it in six months because
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
they have a requirement to do that in a
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
short time so those are things we need
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
to look at before we make such a
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
precipitous move thank you you know if I
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
could just make one just maybe make one
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the one other comment on this is they
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
um you know my my sort of expectation
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and obviously this committee has to
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
do what you think is right but my
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
expectation had been that that what
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
would make the most sense would be
 
01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
to to leave the two track system in
 
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
effect for you know two or three years
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
see how things sort of work out and then
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
if it if the if the land use appeals
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
board works out as I think it will you
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
know a very efficient way to handle
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
these things then it might at that point
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
it might make sense to eliminate the the
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
hab and I guess the the one thing I
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
would say is you know to the extent that
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
you you point out and I I can't disagree
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
with you on the question of of
 
01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:56.750 align:start position:0%
with you on the question of of
efficiency

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
um we we have had four geez as long as I
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
can remember at least 50 years I think
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
we have had the sort of two-track system
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to the board of tax and land
 
01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
appeals and the superior court and you
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
know at least as far as I know nobody
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
has sort of been complaining about that
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
saying that it's inefficient to do that
 
01:14:20.209 --> 01:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
and and whatever so you know me my
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
impression is that what happens in that
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
what has developed over the years and
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
the simpler cases tend to for of tax and
 
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
land you know uh tax assessment uh
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
complaints or eminent domain the simpler
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
cases tend to go to the board of tax and
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
land appeals and the really big cases
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
involving let's say utility taxation or
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
whatever go to the superior court maybe
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
it would turn out you know two or three
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
years from now if you had both the land
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
you stock it and the housing appeals
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
board that that same thing would kind of
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
develop there I don't know but that's
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
that might be one reason to sort of you
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
know Let it Fly with the two two track
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
no I am a little sympathetic to
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's concern as I
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
recall the housing appeals board had a
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
budget of just shy of six hundred
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and if you look at the
 
01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:16.580 align:start position:0%
superior court judge position it was
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
significantly less than that so I think
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's from a financial standpoint I can
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
see where representative McGuire was
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I think they're quite similar
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
actually they're both in the 500 plus
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
range but again one was doing a lot more
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
cases than the other now that you're
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
right that the board of tax and land
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
appeals is a completely different story
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
because that one is stressed you know
 
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
they they have they're got more cases
 
01:15:46.729 --> 01:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
than they can handle almost and so that
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
one we we if we had a funds we would add
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
to maybe add a person to because they
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
they are very popular and heavily used
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of stuff so the two
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
situations are not necessarily
 
01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:02.270 align:start position:0%
situations are not necessarily
comparable

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
all right all right there's been a
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
motion to uh
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
all this and uh
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
to put in the budget is that what I
 
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:13.580 align:start position:0%
understand correctly okay well part one
 
01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
part one with a possible Amendment from
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
you I guess
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no more discussion
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
those in favor of retaining this bill
 
01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
those opposed it's unanimous
 
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll back up on our list and go to
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 337 relative
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
to direct the office of professional
 
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification to provide
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
a good representative from a Hudson
 
01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
how are you
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
no I guess not
 
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Joe nullery
 
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
I'm co-sponsor of House Bill 337 I
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Hudson now
 
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
ah first I'm going to read a note from
 
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh representative Merchant who is the
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the Bill of prime sponsor in
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
my opinion the fiscal note remains above
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
what I believe is necessary note that
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
the expense would come from the oplc
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
operating revenues that is licensing
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
fees and permits not from the general
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
funds that is taxes another bill is
 
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
working its way through Ways and Means
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
which would create a non-lapsing fund
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
for the oplc that would allow the agency
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
to retain somewhere around five million
 
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
dollars to smooth out cash flows between
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
all the boards so 90 000 per year should
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
be have little to no impact on the oplc
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
budget uh I was just getting some
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
schooling on the fiscal notes that was
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
provided by the LBA and it appears that
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
it sits off a little bit because
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at the classified
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
employees a uh pay scale for a grade 28
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
step one it's 94 000 a year two times
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
that is 188
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
000 and then 112 for the other employees
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
however that's not the purpose of the
 
01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:27.890 align:start position:0%
however that's not the purpose of the
bill

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
but as you read the bill
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about expending a lot of
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
money it talks about
 
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
conforming to existing law
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
I was part of a commission this summer I
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
was a bipartisan commission served with
 
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.910 align:start position:0%
was a bipartisan commission served with
the

01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
representing Merchant and and several
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
others regarding uh the oplc and its
 
01:18:51.659 --> 01:18:52.970 align:start position:0%
others regarding uh the oplc and its
restructuring

01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was strongly
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
pushed was a lack of communication a
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
lack of notice meetings were being held
 
01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
make it crystal clear
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
that RSA 91a public meetings applies to
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
oplc and the commissions of which it
 
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.830 align:start position:0%
oplc and the commissions of which it
oversees

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
oversees
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's the key position
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
as for the funding we do have the uh
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
um non-lapsing fund that will be
 
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
established which should cover the most
 
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
the cost oplc says even in the fiscal
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
note here that it should be able to
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of this in-house at the
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
current time
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
there's a representative from oplc here
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
today and there's a representative from
 
01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:51.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.669 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
regarding the operation of the uh oplc
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
when it's restructured this should be
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
able to fit right within their General
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
operating it should not be an additional
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
expense either to the regulated entities
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
or to the taxpayers of the State of New
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know the policy of making sure that
 
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
91a is complied with has already been
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
agreed to the only thing sticking here
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
is whether or not
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost money and it's my
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
opinion it's representing Merchant's
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
opinion that it's not going to cost any
 
01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
additional money but will benefit the
 
01:20:41.699 --> 01:20:42.649 align:start position:0%
additional money but will benefit the
state

01:20:42.649 --> 01:20:42.659 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
by making sure that
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
meetings are public and that oplc when
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
we get the our reorganization done we'll
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
be able to operate this in an effective
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
manner uh
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're already mostly through this budget
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
year so
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
well we'll let it go at that and I'll be
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions I can to
 
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
my limited expertise but I would defer
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
specific questions regarding the
 
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
operation of oplc to jeez oplc
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
before we move any further my apologies
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman I didn't ask you to let us
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
know how this proceeded from the
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee to the house and the votes and
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill came out of the Edna
 
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.450 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill came out of the Edna
committee

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
with an ought to pass
 
01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment by a vote
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
of 20 to zero
 
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
and it passed the floor with a past the
 
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
house with a Voice vote we do have a
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal note dated
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
um February 28th
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
yeah everybody should have that in their
 
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:56.810 align:start position:0%
yeah everybody should have that in their
packet

01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
packet
 
01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.709 align:start position:0%
packet
um

01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:59.930 --> 01:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal note
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
showed roughly uh 311 dollar impact on
 
01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
General and other funds and
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
this one shows a general and other
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
impact of around 94 to 99 thousand
 
01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:15.850 align:start position:0%
impact of around 94 to 99 thousand
dollars

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:15.860 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
you know up two and yeah up two up two
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
is like yeah
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
are there questions representative
 
01:22:24.659 --> 01:22:26.270 align:start position:0%
are there questions representative
Weiler

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative ulery
 
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
we have about a hundred and
 
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
127 pages in hb2 all dealing with oplc
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
do you imagine that this study committee
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
Iran had something to do with that
 
01:22:45.490 --> 01:22:45.500 align:start position:0%
I imagine a lot of things
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
ah and it is very possible that that
 
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
study committee uh had some input onto
 
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
that there were uh some entities that uh
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
we need to license in the state there's
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
no question about it uh there are other
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
entities such as braiding hair that
 
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:07.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily need to be
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
regulated with a license
 
01:23:13.729 --> 01:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
maybe business certification is enough
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to move out to pass on
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
the house bill 337
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
um and speak to my motion if you get a
 
01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
you may discuss all right so I spoke to
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire about this
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
bill and apparently the reason for the
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
large initial
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
um fiscal note had to do with a
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
error in the drafting of the bill like
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
an L was a one or something and and
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
so it really isn't a bill that that has
 
01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in it it's it's all
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
self-contained within oplc
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
um both both the bill that
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey is talking about
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
and also House Bill 2
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
makes oplc essentially controlled all by
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
other funds and so therefore there's
 
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
this is there's no General funds in this
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
so you saying the fiscal note is
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
incorrect because it does check off
 
01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
well the fiscal note has to be based on
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
current law not based on prospective
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
future law right and so when if and when
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
as we expect lplc will be sort of become
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
a separate entity and and
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
have their own kind of fund then that
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
won't be general fund take it out of
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
your wallet yes okay so representative
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
evil has a question yeah so I take it
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is not included in the overhaul of
 
01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.370 --> 01:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's really a separate policy thing
 
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
about notifications right it's not a
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
changing any licenses or yeah
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion has been made by
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire seconded by
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative Kimbrell's
 
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
but Sweeney
 
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.209 align:start position:0%
but Sweeney
oh

01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:17.219 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
no that's yeah
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.729 --> 01:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
so we're all clear it's a motion of
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
well actually because it's a motion to
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
move something to the full committee
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
will take a roll call when the clerk is
 
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.890 align:start position:0%
will take a roll call when the clerk is
ready

01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
my first exciting moment
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
this magic
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire yes
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
let me just say that we're voting on HB
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
337 and the motion is ought to pass
 
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative cambrows yes
 
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
um the clerk votes yes

01:26:34.129 --> 01:26:34.139 align:start position:0%
that chair representative Weiler yes
 
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
and representative yes
 
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.790 align:start position:0%
and representative yes

okay
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
nine zero
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
voting 9-0
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%

01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
so the last one at 10 30 we if we go
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
time to if if is the head of oplc here
 
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
time to if if is the head of oplc here
no

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
I I have a question for oplc
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
and if you could state your name Douglas
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
general counsel for oplc o s t e r h o u
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
d t pronounced exactly as it's spelled
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
except for the silent letters
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
I need a new joke I use that everywhere
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get the lapse anymore
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here I'm looking
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
through hb2 but I didn't see
 
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
whether this hit a fiscal note for all
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
this reorganization for for hp2 I
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
haven't had an opportunity to review hb2
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
yet so I am not the expert on that it
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
came out yesterday morning I have been
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
working on at the request of the Edna
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on 655 amended a language
 
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
to 655 that I submitted this morning hp2
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
is my weekend homework assignment so all
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
right so if you would ask the agency to
 
01:27:59.209 --> 01:27:59.219 align:start position:0%
have by net early next week absolutely
 
01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
what the uh
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal effects are of all this
 
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
reorganization so if the fiscal effects
 
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
are similar to 655 take this with a
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
grain of salt and I will confirm this
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
and get back to the committee next week
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
then it should be uh
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's basically just moving
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
current law into six five five and
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
certainly also you you eliminated some
 
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
some certifications and some licensing
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how many maybe six seven
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
didn't read like that many 34. so there
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
should be some savings that would also
 
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
be of great interest to us
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
I just so everyone knows I've referred
 
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
the entire section dealing with these
 
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
changes to Edna since there's some major
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
policy changes get their read before we
 
01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.149 align:start position:0%
policy changes get their read before we
Act

01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
Act
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I actually did attend on
 
01:28:59.050 --> 01:28:59.060 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the Edna committee meeting and
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
oplc will be probably at every single
 
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.290 align:start position:0%
oplc will be probably at every single
meeting

01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you must have a
 
01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
question not a question but we did get a
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
piece of paper from the LBA on on the
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal changes of eliminating those
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
licenses right it was 900 000 a year or
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
something like that I saw a piece of
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
paper no
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
well you are right there is a
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
significant uh decline in Revenue
 
01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
because of those fees right because
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
there was there was like eight licenses
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
eliminated and
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know like lnas normally brings in
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
150 000 and some other you know there
 
01:29:37.129 --> 01:29:37.139 align:start position:0%
was some other numbers there do you
 
01:29:38.689 --> 01:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
remember no
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not sure if that's something we
 
01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
produce because neither one of us
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
recalls it okay I think it was presented
 
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
by oplc there was a pretty sharp decline
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
in some Revenue but they thought they
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
might make it up because more people may
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the shared Cooperative
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
license sharing or something but it was
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
something I think it was in their budget
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
presentation on the last page it had the
 
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
reduction of the 900 plus thousand
 
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
dollars based on the licensing you're
 
01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.610 align:start position:0%
dollars based on the licensing you're
correct

01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
so next we have uh House Bill 576
 
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
relative to the administration of a
 
01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
commercial property assessment or says
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
clean energy sea pace
 
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
I believe we have an amendment is that
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
let's see and if we could get that
 
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
I think this is very helpful that the
 
01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
yes this uh this bill came out of the
 
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
with the report of ought to pass with
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.639 --> 01:31:02.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:06.780 align:start position:0%
results of the house floor was a Voice
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
vote to adopt that Amendment
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.729 --> 01:31:16.739 align:start position:0%
so representative from Nashville I
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
believe you were working with
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney and someone from
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
the banking community and you
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that you'd like us to
 
01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:25.790 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that you'd like us to
consider

01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
correct and uh thank you to I apologize
 
01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
the last time you had it was a total
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
confusion in my hand and I didn't show
 
01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
up for the work session and I appreciate
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
a second opportunity to come before you
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Sweeney has the
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
Incorporated the banking
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
Bankers request so let me just go over
 
01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:01.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:07.570 --> 01:32:07.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
2023-1-0162 H you should all have that
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
that replaces the original bill in
 
01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
entirety which was five HP 576.
 
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:27.620 align:start position:0%
uh and including the title
 
01:32:31.209 --> 01:32:31.219 align:start position:0%
where in the original bill it said
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
establishing Reserve fund
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
and so this amendment replaced and just
 
01:32:42.649 --> 01:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
included to make it an enabling
 
01:32:42.659 --> 01:32:44.270 align:start position:0%
included to make it an enabling
legislation

01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
and what the enabling legislation
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
is to the first of all the
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
title is changed to relative to
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
administration of a commercial property
 
01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:02.219 align:start position:0%
assessed clean energy
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
the keyword is the commercial program in
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
a Clean Energy Efficiency and clean
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
energy District so the word funding
 
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
fund is not even there so that's a huge
 
01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:18.410 align:start position:0%
fund is not even there so that's a huge
step

01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
step
 
01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:20.870 align:start position:0%
step
and

01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:33:27.649 --> 01:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
Paces property assessed clean energy
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
which means any assessment of the
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
property value because of the
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
Improvement of the clean energy like the
 
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:43.940 align:start position:0%
conservation efficiency is
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
the property and it stays with the
 
01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:50.629 align:start position:0%
the property and it stays with the
property

01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
just like the mortgage the property
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
value stays with the property and the
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
borrower can change
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
without the C pace
 
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:03.530 align:start position:0%
without the C pace
the

01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
if I make an improvement in my
 
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
multi-family apartment complex
 
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
getting the loan
 
01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:13.990 align:start position:0%
getting the loan
and

01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
that is on top of the mortgage so the
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
lien is not on the property so the
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
investor clean energy investor seepace
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
investor will not get if there is a
 
01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
investor will not get if there is a
default

01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
default
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay so mortgage lender
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
will have the first the municipalities
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
of course the property tax taxes and
 
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
then the in a mortgage lender so the in
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
C Pace I don't know if how detailed you
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
want me to go into so you can clarify or
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
I can clarify or stop me when I don't
 
01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
you could probably stop there if you
 
01:34:59.689 --> 01:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
comfortable okay
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
so the only changes
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
that the amendment that uh
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney brought in
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment that passed on Voice vote
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
and uh this committee
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:34.139 align:start position:0%
right two and five is where the it was
 
01:35:34.139 --> 01:35:35.149 align:start position:0%
right two and five is where the it was
struck

01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
struck
 
01:35:35.159 --> 01:35:37.729 align:start position:0%
struck
and

01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
which was the mortgage the this
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
ought to say 80 will include except that
 
01:35:50.169 --> 01:35:50.179 align:start position:0%
all prior recorded mortgages or liens
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
shall retain property over the lien of
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
the assessment contract unless all set
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
mortgages or lien holders of record have
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
consented to the lien as provided by RSA
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
53 f
 
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
5 so this is if there is already a lien
 
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
and already a mortgage holder they if
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
they give consent to the new
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
improvements in the loan
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
it can be added as a equal if it is not
 
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.179 align:start position:0%
then the C pays investors not the
 
01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
investment is not in part to the market
 
01:36:29.219 --> 01:36:30.490 align:start position:0%
investment is not in part to the market
foreign

01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:30.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thanks for
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
working this out and further comment on
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
it yes thank you I just want for the
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
record to state so after our work
 
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
session uh the next day while we had
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
session during a break uh myself the
 
01:36:44.209 --> 01:36:44.219 align:start position:0%
representative from the bankers
 
01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
Association and chairman Bose from the
 
01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
that first had this the focus on the
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
policy uh he reiterated that he was one
 
01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
in support of the underlying policy that
 
01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
turned it into enabling legislation uh
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
and then as we began to discuss the
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
banking implications of the bill he
 
01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
actually stopped us in our conversation
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
and said we talked as a committee to
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
sort of let the next committee tackle
 
01:37:12.250 --> 01:37:12.260 align:start position:0%
the banking issue that was in the bill
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
so I took the suggested amendment that
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
the bankers presented to US during the
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
work session brought that to OLS and
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's the uh zero six nine two H uh
 
01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:28.139 align:start position:0%
that I passed around I also had Janet
 
01:37:28.139 --> 01:37:32.350 align:start position:0%
that I passed around I also had Janet
Prentice

01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
this should be right underneath a binder
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
for you and then um the municipal
 
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
Association shared with me this uh
 
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
document from the sea Pace Alliance
 
01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.139 align:start position:0%
which is the National Group in support
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
of C Pace loans about the mortgage
 
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
lender's guide and I just had Janet
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
print copies and I passed those around I
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
don't know if those made it around the
 
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
table uh just kind of gives the overview
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
just of how even the C Pace wants the
 
01:38:02.689 --> 01:38:02.699 align:start position:0%
mortgage process to work
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
um my understanding and I had the
 
01:38:07.689 --> 01:38:07.699 align:start position:0%
bankers review the proposed amendment
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
from my understanding their support of
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment to fix the issue
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
with the lien holders and the priority
 
01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
loans so that's that's what I can report
 
01:38:21.530 --> 01:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
based on the work so
 
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sweeney
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
so see no more questions on the
 
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.570 align:start position:0%
so see no more questions on the
amendment

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:28.580 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin well it's really
 
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
not a question I'd like to say that I
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
was against this bill
 
01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.850 align:start position:0%
was against this bill
originally

01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
but all my concerns are addressed by the
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and I think I think it's good
 
01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
work and we need to go with it okay
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
again thanks for your efforts
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney well done
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
so we'll just have a show of hands to
 
01:38:58.209 --> 01:38:58.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
20230692h I'll show our hands
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
so unanimous
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
so when the clerk is ready I'll ask for
 
01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:10.820 align:start position:0%
a motion to accept
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended
 
01:39:16.689 --> 01:39:16.699 align:start position:0%
that's uh I'll spill five seven six yes
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
so does this have any budget impact if
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's indeterminable
 
01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.490 align:start position:0%
it's indeterminable
yeah

01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
so explain maybe someone should explain
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
in what way it might have a budget
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
impact yeah
 
01:39:32.649 --> 01:39:32.659 align:start position:0%
um if I can take a shot at it yes
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
because this is a savings conservation
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
efficiency right it's prevention so how
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
do you put a cost to the prevention
 
01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
right now we have no space uh C based
 
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
investors in the state because there's
 
01:39:52.729 --> 01:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
no enabling legislation to come and
 
01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:56.540 align:start position:0%
invest in it so
 
01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
is there a cost to the state or the
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
municipality no
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
it is the private property owners
 
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.330 align:start position:0%
it is the private property owners
non-profit

01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
whoever so
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
um from that
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
there's nothing coming out of the state
 
01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.729 align:start position:0%
there's nothing coming out of the state
budget

01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we have the
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
the latest fiscal note dated 228 which I
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
think is no change for the initial
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note Mr Hoffman that came with
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
it it actually did change from the
 
01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
initial fiscal note okay and this is a
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
01:40:35.159 --> 01:40:35.750 align:start position:0%
situation where
um

01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
we went back and forth in writing this
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
we if the bill had been introduced in
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
its present form we may have not even
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
had a physical note at all
 
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
because it's something that communities
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
can choose to do it doesn't Force
 
01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:51.290 align:start position:0%
can choose to do it doesn't Force
anything

01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
so to just to go back to that I had the
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
original bill and I brought the
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to my initial uh public
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and it was not accepted at that
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
time so the amendment was not accepted
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
at the initial uh you know and uh all
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
the discussion was based on the bill
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
that was not in existence so that's why
 
01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
in the work session are not the exact
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
session I had to bring not I couldn't
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
bring a Amendment but one of the
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee members had to bring an
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
amendment and I had to be there to say
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
this is what it is and I couldn't
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate the bankers representative
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you just based on the
 
01:41:39.169 --> 01:41:39.179 align:start position:0%
really light research I did this does
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
the way it is now after the Amendments
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh it is enabling legislation to the
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the Sea PACE program
 
01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
is really designed for municipalities
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
with 50 000 residents or larger uh which
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
we have too in New Hampshire so it is
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
for just those municipalities so those
 
01:42:00.890 --> 01:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities if they choose locally to
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
pursue this enabling legislation uh
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's where any taxpayer cost would
 
01:42:10.209 --> 01:42:10.219 align:start position:0%
come but that's on there that's on them
 
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.209 --> 01:42:17.219 align:start position:0%

representative Griffin seconds
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that's um
 
01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:23.300 align:start position:0%
house bills
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
576 with Amendment zero six nine two H
 
01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.350 align:start position:0%
576 with Amendment zero six nine two H

01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay the vote is unanimous at nine two
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 330 FN relative to the
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
National Guard recruiting incentive
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
program and it's funding in rule making
 
01:43:31.129 --> 01:43:31.139 align:start position:0%
is this hasn't been to the floor right
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
yet or did it come out of the DNA yeah
 
01:43:36.649 --> 01:43:36.659 align:start position:0%
Edna it's new to us we haven't heard it
 
01:43:36.659 --> 01:43:37.910 align:start position:0%

yet
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
so Mr Hoffman what do we have on the

01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to take me a minute to get
 
01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
the docket because I didn't have that
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.169 --> 01:44:15.179 align:start position:0%

01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass vote of 13-0 and it had a
 
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
um yeah it doesn't tell me whether it
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.719 --> 01:45:09.169 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:45:09.179 --> 01:48:57.770 align:start position:0%
sorry
yeah

01:48:57.770 --> 01:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
anyway uh here we are Mr Hoffman the
 
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
I was looking at the wrong laptop there
 
01:49:14.639 --> 01:49:16.310 align:start position:0%
I was looking at the wrong laptop there
it

01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
it came out of a military Affairs and
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
Veterans Services unanimously 13-0 and
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
then passed for The Voice vote on the
 
01:49:25.199 --> 01:49:27.709 align:start position:0%
then passed for The Voice vote on the
floor

01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
let's hear it welcome and if you could
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
state your name for the record please
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
and I forget your last name if you could
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Aaron zayak
 
01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's Z as in zebra a y
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
a c as in Charlie
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
I am um the administrator of business
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
um so basically
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
um this bill really just has three
 
01:50:16.619 --> 01:50:18.229 align:start position:0%
um this bill really just has three
components

01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
components
 
01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
um the first component of it raises
 
01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
enlistment incentive payments
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and those incentive payments are
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
meant for current and former members of
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so it'll bring that up from 500 to a
 
01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.709 align:start position:0%
um so it'll bring that up from 500 to a
thousand

01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
um the second piece is it um it removes
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
rule making requirements for both the
 
01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education assistance and
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
enlistment incentive programs So within
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
our statutes under 110 um B colon 8A we
 
01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
are exempt from rule making so this just
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
really administratively cleans up
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
um cleans up our statutes and finally it
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
allows us it kind of gives us a place to
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
take fines collected through military
 
01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
Justice process
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and and gives us a spot to to kind of
 
01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
Park those so we'll be putting those or
 
01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:10.139 align:start position:0%
cutting those into the enlistment
 
01:51:10.139 --> 01:51:11.470 align:start position:0%
cutting those into the enlistment
incentive

01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions represent
 
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
camberells thank you Mr chair uh you
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
just when you you gave your introduction
 
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
you said the incentive is for current
 
01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
and former uh can you explain former or
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
what how that would work
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes so it's actually
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
um we have internal processes that have
 
01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
been developed to determine so basically
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
we'll work in conjunction with our
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
military Partners our federal Partners
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
um the person coming forward whether or
 
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
not they were a former member and the
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
status of that former member before we
 
01:51:53.689 --> 01:51:53.699 align:start position:0%
make payments so they'll um both Army
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
and air have kind of their processes to
 
01:51:57.649 --> 01:51:57.659 align:start position:0%
vet the person
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
um once that's once that's vetted it
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
will come through the state business
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes Weiler
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you I haven't been involved in
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
this some time ago this is a competitive
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
market we have former military people or
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
people that are looking to to join the
 
01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:18.470 align:start position:0%
people that are looking to to join the
military

01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
and they have a choice in the National
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
Guard they could go to Massachusetts
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont to any nearby State and
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
they all always look at the incentives
 
01:52:28.729 --> 01:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
one of the incentives we've always given
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
is is a a tuition break at State schools
 
01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:34.370 align:start position:0%
is is a a tuition break at State schools
which

01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
I remember at one point Massachusetts
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
would give you the full four years in
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
one of the colleges we we kind of
 
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
it was space available type thing I
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
don't know if it still is but
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
so we have to stay competitive to get
 
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
the enlistments we need thank you
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
now uh represent a former representative
 
01:52:59.689 --> 01:52:59.699 align:start position:0%
baldazzaro was very keen on some of this
 
01:53:01.729 --> 01:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
stuff do you still have the education
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
benefit to help people with secondary
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
education and
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
yes and I don't know off the top of my
 
01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:09.659 align:start position:0%
head the exact details but we still do
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
have education benefits and we certainly
 
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
continue to pursue other options or
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
continuing to expand those
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
um so again as data by representative
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
Weiler we we do try to maintain um being
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
very competitive New England is a small
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
area so it's easy for someone within New
 
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
England to kind of choose which guard
 
01:53:28.609 --> 01:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
they want to be a part of so we want to
 
01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:30.179 align:start position:0%
really try to keep them in New Hampshire
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
where possible representative Sweeney
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
being here Tara question this is I'm
 
01:53:37.129 --> 01:53:37.139 align:start position:0%
going to start with an assumption and
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
you can correct me if I'm I'm wrong but
 
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
it would appear the last three years for
 
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
the guard where some of the busiest
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%

yes we were we were extremely busy
 
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:55.500 align:start position:0%

daily operation brief that we get and
 
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:00.300 align:start position:0%

representative Reed I'm assuming you're
 
02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you honorable
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
members yes
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
um as was the comments that I just heard
 
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
you all speak about
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
um the bill has no fiscal impact at all
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
in its current form as amended and
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
supported unanimously out of the
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee
 
02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
it simply says that the contact
 
02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
information for legal assistance will be
 
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
included in any eviction notice doesn't
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
increase the number of eviction notices
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
or anything like that so no uh no impact
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
on printing or anything even that minor
 
02:01:54.109 --> 02:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
so it had started as a bill creating an
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
empty bucket because I've had a number
 
02:01:59.689 --> 02:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
of uh of meetings with Senator Maggie
 
02:02:04.129 --> 02:02:04.139 align:start position:0%
Hassan's team and they are indicating
 
02:02:06.410 --> 02:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
favorably that perhaps we may be able to
 
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
get funding for a tenant eviction lawyer
 
02:02:13.129 --> 02:02:13.139 align:start position:0%
fund so that's how it started but that's
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
not the form in front of you and not the
 
02:02:16.129 --> 02:02:16.139 align:start position:0%
form that passed unanimously out of
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary so
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah kind of shouldn't be here but
 
02:02:22.729 --> 02:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
there you go Mr Hoffman docket
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
oh Melissa thanks uh so I went to
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee
 
02:02:32.209 --> 02:02:32.219 align:start position:0%
committee with an ought to pass with
 
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment recommendation uh 20-0 and
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
then I went to the house floor and
 
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
passed this floor with the ought to pass
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment on a Voice vote
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean the the only possible
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
objection to this bill is you know the
 
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
judicial council is like a 44 million
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
dollar a year operation and this is
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially advertising to get the more
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
business so you know it could cost money
 
02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:11.219 align:start position:0%
in that way but you know obviously we
 
02:03:13.729 --> 02:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
I'll make it not to pass motion I don't
 
02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
that was safe no yeah so the
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
has been made of ought to pass was moved
 
02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:26.940 align:start position:0%

02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%

Department of Environmental Services uh
 
03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd asked me to attend
 
03:33:23.929 --> 03:33:23.939 align:start position:0%
uh so for this program
 
03:33:27.110 --> 03:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh I can go in as little or as as much
 
03:33:30.290 --> 03:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
as you want to it's an existing program
 
03:33:33.290 --> 03:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
that the agency is running again for the
 
03:33:35.990 --> 03:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust fund uh
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
we are we are responsible for
 
03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
administering those funds so the trust
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
fund set up three years ago this program
 
03:33:46.490 --> 03:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh to look at uh providing well
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
assistance again more than 50 roughly 50
 
03:33:52.849 --> 03:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
of the well uh water uh private water is
 
03:33:54.590 --> 03:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
being served through Wells rather than
 
03:33:58.729 --> 03:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
water systems and uh the context of this
 
03:34:01.729 --> 03:34:01.739 align:start position:0%
uh is for natural disasters so of late
 
03:34:04.250 --> 03:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
the past three years uh different parts
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the state have been in severe drought
 
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh we will see what happens tomorrow
 
03:34:11.929 --> 03:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
that will be a help towards that
 
03:34:14.690 --> 03:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
alleviating that that end or tonight
 
03:34:14.700 --> 03:34:16.070 align:start position:0%
alleviating that that end or tonight
rather

03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
rather
 
03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
um but even with that uh it really is an
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
issue for Drought for New Hampshire with
 
03:34:25.309 --> 03:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
how much uh recharging if you will of
 
03:34:27.950 --> 03:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
the aquifers so there's I give it a 50
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
50 chance that uh you know after June
 
03:34:33.170 --> 03:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
this year we'll be back into a drought I
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
hope I'm wrong so that was really where
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
this program has been focusing of late
 
03:34:40.550 --> 03:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
the concept though is not just for
 
03:34:43.010 --> 03:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
droughts so a good example is some years
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
back prior to covet if any of us can
 
03:34:49.250 --> 03:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
remember that we had severe storms uh
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
that included some flooding around the
 
03:34:53.929 --> 03:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
baker River and the scouring that was
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
associated with that changed the water
 
03:34:59.929 --> 03:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
table for nearby Wells in uh I want to
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
say Warner I keep the name Warren New
 
03:35:05.090 --> 03:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so that was kind of the
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
opposite but it resulted in permanent
 
03:35:10.190 --> 03:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
loss of water for some private Wells at
 
03:35:13.190 --> 03:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
the time uh Senator uh gaida did a fun
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
GoFundMe page because there was no other
 
03:35:16.849 --> 03:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
way to fund this type of thing to help
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
those folks so that was kind of the that
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
type of event was kind of the emphasis
 
03:35:22.849 --> 03:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
for this since then the drinking water
 
03:35:25.610 --> 03:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund has allocated a
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
little over 3.1 million dollars towards
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
this effort we've helped uh roughly well
 
03:35:33.170 --> 03:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
not roughly we've helped 160 private
 
03:35:36.670 --> 03:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
well owners either have their Wells uh
 
03:35:40.370 --> 03:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
modified or to actually connect to
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
public water I believe uh for the trust
 
03:35:46.130 --> 03:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
fund the intent of this legislation
 
03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
again we've been asked to provide
 
03:35:51.710 --> 03:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
support for it was to kind of codify
 
03:35:53.809 --> 03:35:53.819 align:start position:0%
and make this a long-term thing this has
 
03:35:55.370 --> 03:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
been happening for the trust fund I
 
03:35:57.889 --> 03:35:57.899 align:start position:0%
think the desire was to we're seeing the
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
need the understanding was and again
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd is the current chair
 
03:36:04.490 --> 03:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
of the trust fund uh I think the desire
 
03:36:07.550 --> 03:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
was to to have this become a an ongoing
 
03:36:10.010 --> 03:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
thing and they wanted my understanding
 
03:36:12.590 --> 03:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know a blessing of the the
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
general court so with that I'm happy to
 
03:36:17.090 --> 03:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have
 
03:36:19.250 --> 03:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
um and again representative Boyd I know
 
03:36:21.170 --> 03:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
he wanted to be here I know he said some
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
Communications but he asked me to be
 
03:36:22.800 --> 03:36:24.950 align:start position:0%
Communications but he asked me to be
here

03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:36:24.960 --> 03:36:26.269 align:start position:0%
here
acquire

03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
acquire
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:36:31.130 --> 03:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
coming so this is a new chapter but you
 
03:36:33.769 --> 03:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
say you're already doing it right we are
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
doing this as a kind of a pilot program
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
through the drinking water groundwater
 
03:36:39.070 --> 03:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
03:36:44.210 --> 03:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
Oasis sure so so no money has been this
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
is a new fund right so therefore okay
 
03:36:48.830 --> 03:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
right I believe the intent of this
 
03:36:50.809 --> 03:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
legislation is that they have funding
 
03:36:52.190 --> 03:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
other than the the drinking water
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund and into a
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
special account exactly okay
 
03:36:59.330 --> 03:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
um now I went to the website for this
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
thing and it said no droughts currently
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
correct okay all right
 
03:37:06.410 --> 03:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:37:08.750 --> 03:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin involved by Ebel
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
so if if we were were to have a drought
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
this some
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh could you still draw from the
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
drinking water trust fund
 
03:37:22.370 --> 03:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
we have some monies remaining in the
 
03:37:24.769 --> 03:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
trust fund I I to be to be blunt if if
 
03:37:26.450 --> 03:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
this program were to continue we'd need
 
03:37:29.210 --> 03:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
another infusion from the trust fund
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.050 --> 03:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
further question or
 
03:37:38.330 --> 03:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
represent evil
 
03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
clarify thank you for being here could
 
03:37:42.349 --> 03:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
you just clarify what the original
 
03:37:45.170 --> 03:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
funding source was for the drinking
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater trust fund and the
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
extent of the fund sure so if we go back
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
in time uh we we're still grappling with
 
03:37:56.210 --> 03:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
it but I think well uh we've had a lot
 
03:37:58.490 --> 03:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
of issues with mtbe contamination which
 
03:38:01.610 --> 03:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
is a additive of gasoline the Attorney
 
03:38:03.650 --> 03:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
General's office and a lot of the staff
 
03:38:06.889 --> 03:38:06.899 align:start position:0%
with the our agency Des spent a lot of
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
time with the the manufacturers uh in
 
03:38:12.769 --> 03:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
distribute Distributors if you will of
 
03:38:16.130 --> 03:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
mtbe so there were two elements of that
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
there was a short answer is uh MTB
 
03:38:19.560 --> 03:38:20.889 align:start position:0%
there was a short answer is uh MTB
obscure

03:38:20.889 --> 03:38:20.899 align:start position:0%
obscure
 
03:38:23.450 --> 03:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
I was going to say MTV mobile I get that
 
03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
wrong they don't want to be called that
 
03:38:26.830 --> 03:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:38:31.370 --> 03:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
mobile Corp uh effectively uh did not
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
settle with the state uh that they ended
 
03:38:35.929 --> 03:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
up going to court they lost the the
 
03:38:38.330 --> 03:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
Court ruling provided Monies to the
 
03:38:40.969 --> 03:38:40.979 align:start position:0%
state uh to the tune of 300 million
 
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
dollars or so uh between a certain
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
amount of that once the rainy day fund
 
03:38:50.929 --> 03:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
uh and the the rest of that went uh to
 
03:38:52.370 --> 03:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
the drinking water groundwater trust
 
03:38:54.050 --> 03:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
fund that was a legislatively uh
 
03:38:56.330 --> 03:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
established and that's that's the where
 
03:38:58.250 --> 03:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
the monies for that come from the trust
 
03:39:02.570 --> 03:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
fund by Statute is able to is able to
 
03:39:04.490 --> 03:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
address things more than just MTB
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
contamination and is geared towards uh
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
by definition and statute to address
 
03:39:15.889 --> 03:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire
 
03:39:19.130 --> 03:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
well I want to talk about the bill
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
itself I don't really haven't worked
 
03:39:20.520 --> 03:39:22.610 align:start position:0%
itself I don't really haven't worked
much

03:39:22.610 --> 03:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
oh representative thank you Mr chair
 
03:39:29.210 --> 03:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
um so you said that some 300 million
 
03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
dollars were given based on the lawsuit
 
03:39:32.100 --> 03:39:33.769 align:start position:0%
dollars were given based on the lawsuit
and

03:39:33.769 --> 03:39:33.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:35.570 --> 03:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
I heard you mention earlier that
 
03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
recently you allocated 3.1 million to
 
03:39:41.389 --> 03:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
help out with well situations where'd
 
03:39:43.429 --> 03:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
the rest of the 300 million go so
 
03:39:46.010 --> 03:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
there's currently 108 million roughly
 
03:39:47.330 --> 03:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
still in the drinking water groundwater
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
trust fund uh that has been
 
03:39:55.370 --> 03:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
the intent of that fund has been to we
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
we issue loans and grants to drinking
 
03:40:00.110 --> 03:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
water systems uh and drinking water
 
03:40:02.090 --> 03:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
issues so it's sort of obviously the
 
03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
loan money comes back on the long term
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
so there's an intent there to have a
 
03:40:09.050 --> 03:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
certain certain amount of refreshing uh
 
03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
but out of the original amount that's
 
03:40:11.950 --> 03:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
gone to the trust fund there's currently
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
108 million that's unallocated and
 
03:40:18.429 --> 03:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
typically this is a 19 person Commission
 
03:40:22.190 --> 03:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh typically it used to be uh chaired by
 
03:40:22.200 --> 03:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh typically it used to be uh chaired by
uh

03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:25.969 --> 03:40:25.979 align:start position:0%
um the Senate President at the time and
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
now obviously uh representative Boyd
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so we typically try to allocate
 
03:40:34.330 --> 03:40:34.340 align:start position:0%
roughly 20 million or so a year
 
03:40:36.769 --> 03:40:36.779 align:start position:0%
towards uh projects they're they're
 
03:40:39.889 --> 03:40:39.899 align:start position:0%
effectively ranked and and judged by the
 
03:40:42.889 --> 03:40:42.899 align:start position:0%
19 person commission and then awarded
 
03:40:44.690 --> 03:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
based on them
 
03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:46.309 align:start position:0%
based on them
so

03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
and as the rest of the money sitting is
 
03:40:52.250 --> 03:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
it gaining interest and also if you were
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
on the loans what percent do you charge
 
03:40:57.650 --> 03:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh for a Payback
 
03:40:59.630 --> 03:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
no that's a good question so so yes so
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer invests the the
 
03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
funds to to make sure there's some
 
03:41:06.590 --> 03:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know the money's working if you will
 
03:41:08.990 --> 03:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not being allocated and I'm
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
trying to remember some the the I'm
 
03:41:12.650 --> 03:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
going to look behind me because I have
 
03:41:15.050 --> 03:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
some staff so so I think it's at current
 
03:41:17.450 --> 03:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
rates is what is this it's uh loan loan
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
to them but I'm gonna ask uh Brandon if
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:24.170 --> 03:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
yeah if you could just come up and take
 
03:41:25.490 --> 03:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
the mic please
 
03:41:27.650 --> 03:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
and again identify yourself for the
 
03:41:29.450 --> 03:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
record sorry I don't want to complicate
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
things I want to give you a correct
 
03:41:34.570 --> 03:41:34.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:37.250 --> 03:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Brandon Kernan I'm
 
03:41:38.450 --> 03:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
the ministrator of drinking water and
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau des and to answer the
 
03:41:42.650 --> 03:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
question the interest rate established
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
each year based on a publication I
 
03:41:46.490 --> 03:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
believe in November I'd have to go to
 
03:41:47.929 --> 03:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
the exact date right now the interest
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
rate's around 3.1 percent but it'll
 
03:41:51.650 --> 03:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
obviously be adjusted upward this year
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire I think you had
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
something right
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I wanted to just discuss the bill
 
03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
if there's all right yeah so
 
03:42:09.359 --> 03:42:10.190 align:start position:0%
if there's all right yeah so
um

03:42:10.190 --> 03:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:12.650 --> 03:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to this bill and I I have
 
03:42:15.650 --> 03:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
two specific reasons
 
03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
um first is House Rules
 
03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
so in the house rule number 45 Part D it
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
says no committee shall Report with
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
positive recommendation any bill or
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
resolution which would if it enacted
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
violate any article of the New Hampshire
 
03:42:33.290 --> 03:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
Constitution or the United States
 
03:42:36.050 --> 03:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
Constitution or and this is the key part
 
03:42:40.429 --> 03:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
Grant broad rule making authority to any
 
03:42:43.370 --> 03:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
agency or Department the vice chairman
 
03:42:45.889 --> 03:42:45.899 align:start position:0%
or another member of each committee
 
03:42:49.190 --> 03:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
shall review all pending legislation and
 
03:42:51.170 --> 03:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
shall advise the chairman and the
 
03:42:54.410 --> 03:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
members of all legislation before the
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee which could be reviewed in
 
03:42:59.870 --> 03:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
terms of this rule so this Rule and on
 
03:43:01.330 --> 03:43:01.340 align:start position:0%
as the vice chairman
 
03:43:05.090 --> 03:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
this rule has classic broad rule-making
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
Authority if you look at the line 27
 
03:43:11.570 --> 03:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
it says the commissional shall adopt
 
03:43:15.050 --> 03:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
rules under 5 541a relative to the
 
03:43:16.610 --> 03:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
distribution of money from the fund
 
03:43:18.769 --> 03:43:18.779 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration ability to pay
 
03:43:20.809 --> 03:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
natural disaster conditions Etc et
 
03:43:23.090 --> 03:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
cetera and then the department may use a
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
portion of a of appropriated funds to
 
03:43:27.889 --> 03:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
cover the costs of administering this
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
chapter so this this doesn't tell the
 
03:43:31.680 --> 03:43:33.110 align:start position:0%
chapter so this this doesn't tell the
department

03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't Define what a disaster is it
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't say how much each
 
03:43:42.050 --> 03:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
recipient of money can get it doesn't
 
03:43:44.929 --> 03:43:44.939 align:start position:0%
say how it's spent and who it goes to
 
03:43:47.210 --> 03:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
all that sort of stuff
 
03:43:47.220 --> 03:43:47.889 align:start position:0%
all that sort of stuff
um

03:43:47.889 --> 03:43:47.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:50.870 --> 03:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
is not specified all right so that's
 
03:43:52.910 --> 03:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
what we call broad rulemaking Authority
 
03:43:55.010 --> 03:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
so according to house rules we shouldn't
 
03:43:57.170 --> 03:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
approve this bill
 
03:43:59.210 --> 03:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
um as written it needs a lot more detail
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
in that section
 
03:44:04.130 --> 03:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
but my second reason is
 
03:44:04.140 --> 03:44:05.150 align:start position:0%
but my second reason is
um

03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
I just don't think this is a good idea
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
03:44:11.570 --> 03:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
this is this would be a five million
 
03:44:14.090 --> 03:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
dollar pot of money sort of waiting
 
03:44:17.090 --> 03:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
around for a disaster to happen
 
03:44:20.450 --> 03:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
right I mean when do you ever do that do
 
03:44:22.729 --> 03:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
do you you know I have a well at home I
 
03:44:24.130 --> 03:44:24.140 align:start position:0%
don't have a separate bank account
 
03:44:26.690 --> 03:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
waiting for when that well is going to
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
you know need need help I don't know
 
03:44:31.250 --> 03:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
when a flood is going to occur et cetera
 
03:44:33.290 --> 03:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
et cetera in general when disasters
 
03:44:37.070 --> 03:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
happen that's when we we allocate money
 
03:44:39.530 --> 03:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
and get charity and get finma and all
 
03:44:42.170 --> 03:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff and that's when we
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
decide what to do I mean if we had a
 
03:44:43.920 --> 03:44:45.349 align:start position:0%
decide what to do I mean if we had a
fire

03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
fire
 
03:44:47.570 --> 03:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
this money would be sitting there and
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
and you know we'd need other money to to
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
deal with that kind of disaster so so I
 
03:44:54.110 --> 03:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
just don't think it makes sense to have
 
03:44:57.530 --> 03:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
a very specific you know money for some
 
03:45:00.290 --> 03:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
very specific kind of disaster so I want
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:07.190 --> 03:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay it's been moved and seconded uh
 
03:45:08.929 --> 03:45:08.939 align:start position:0%
there is discussion I have some
 
03:45:08.939 --> 03:45:11.150 align:start position:0%
there is discussion I have some
questions

03:45:11.150 --> 03:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner if you commissioner
 
03:45:13.439 --> 03:45:20.750 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner if you commissioner
Scott

03:45:20.750 --> 03:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:22.969 --> 03:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
yes Mr charity
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire pointed out
 
03:45:26.769 --> 03:45:26.779 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
541 with the broad rule making Authority
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
you've obviously had bills before us
 
03:45:34.670 --> 03:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
before with
 
03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
broad rule making authorities this
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
language less restrictive than we've
 
03:45:43.190 --> 03:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
seen or more restrictive or
 
03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
or something similar we've seen from you
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
folks in the past when there's an issue
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
like this
 
03:45:51.170 --> 03:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I can answer that I
 
03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't think it's unprecedented but I
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the representatives
 
03:45:58.670 --> 03:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh questions again the the intent was we
 
03:46:00.290 --> 03:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
are effectively running an existing
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
program and we'd be lifting those those
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
requirements in our rule making so that
 
03:46:08.090 --> 03:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's certainly the attention uh but
 
03:46:13.250 --> 03:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
the the 45 d uh question is is out of my
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
um further to that I had a good
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussion with former Senate President
 
03:46:23.150 --> 03:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
Morse a few days ago about this bill and
 
03:46:25.729 --> 03:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
he encouraged us to support it because
 
03:46:28.130 --> 03:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
it's been such a successful program and
 
03:46:30.170 --> 03:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
allows the department to act quickly
 
03:46:32.050 --> 03:46:32.060 align:start position:0%
especially in light of the present
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
droughts that we have experienced over
 
03:46:37.130 --> 03:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
the last several years is that how you
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
folks look at this that it gives you the
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
funds available immediately to address a
 
03:46:44.450 --> 03:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
lack of water issue versus having to
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
come back for a special appropriation of
 
03:46:49.429 --> 03:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal or filing legislation I think
 
03:46:51.229 --> 03:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
that's a fair fair assessment you know
 
03:46:52.370 --> 03:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
again I've been trying to as
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner I've been trying to be very
 
03:46:55.849 --> 03:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
clear with all the Committees I
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
understand you have a lot of uses for
 
03:46:59.690 --> 03:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
monies and whatnot but as far as the
 
03:47:01.190 --> 03:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
program we certainly support the program
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
and think it's very worthwhile we again
 
03:47:07.090 --> 03:47:07.100 align:start position:0%
it's the intent is for
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
low-income qualifying people that don't
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
have access to you know there's no FEMA
 
03:47:15.050 --> 03:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
money there's no insurance money Etc and
 
03:47:17.570 --> 03:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately again we've seen this as a
 
03:47:19.610 --> 03:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
as a need throughout the state I am
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
concerned we're going to go to year four
 
03:47:24.050 --> 03:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
of severe drought uh and you know again
 
03:47:26.090 --> 03:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
I I would be very pleased to be wrong
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
and the other the other intent of again
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
through the trust fund was again the
 
03:47:34.190 --> 03:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is not wrong
 
03:47:37.250 --> 03:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
there is some intent to have
 
03:47:39.650 --> 03:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
to have some pot of money where the
 
03:47:42.769 --> 03:47:42.779 align:start position:0%
agency could be more agile while FEMA
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
and everybody else was coming into place
 
03:47:47.090 --> 03:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
a good example would be you know you
 
03:47:48.769 --> 03:47:48.779 align:start position:0%
have a major hurricane hits the Seacoast
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
and some wells are salinated so they're
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
no longer they're they're damaged to the
 
03:47:54.889 --> 03:47:54.899 align:start position:0%
point where you there's nothing to be
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
done for them
 
03:47:59.410 --> 03:47:59.420 align:start position:0%
there's needs needs that happen
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
quicker so there's an element of both
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
both to that
 
03:48:06.410 --> 03:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
I guess just a suggestion for the
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
division I think uh representative
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
McGuire's raised some good points it
 
03:48:12.410 --> 03:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
would be my hope that maybe
 
03:48:14.330 --> 03:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire can get together
 
03:48:16.910 --> 03:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
with you folks and tidy up this language
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
on rule making Authority
 
03:48:25.070 --> 03:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
sure representative Griffin
 
03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you this is not a question but
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
apparently the program that existed has
 
03:48:35.090 --> 03:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
not expired
 
03:48:36.950 --> 03:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
and apparently
 
03:48:39.229 --> 03:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
the fund that the money was coming from
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
is still there has some 108 million
 
03:48:43.729 --> 03:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
dollars in that I guess
 
03:48:45.290 --> 03:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:48:49.150 --> 03:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
so I don't see where
 
03:48:51.769 --> 03:48:51.779 align:start position:0%
itl in this bill
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
is is a disaster if we have a drought
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
03:48:59.630 --> 03:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
the program still exists the money is
 
03:49:03.290 --> 03:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
all right any further comments uh
 
03:49:09.710 --> 03:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
we do have a motion before us not seeing
 
03:49:09.720 --> 03:49:10.429 align:start position:0%
we do have a motion before us not seeing
any

03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:49:13.370 --> 03:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative Ebola
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wondered if the
 
03:49:16.910 --> 03:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner could comment on
 
03:49:19.370 --> 03:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin's observation
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
that there are funds that remain in the
 
03:49:26.570 --> 03:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
trust fund and why you're establishing a
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
different channel so to speak
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned in my earlier remarks I
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
think the intent from the the current
 
03:49:40.010 --> 03:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
former chairs uh was to to have a
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
legislative imprint on on this program
 
03:49:45.050 --> 03:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
we've started it it's been running three
 
03:49:47.330 --> 03:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
years we feel it's been successful and
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
needed uh the the
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
People Help throughout the state are
 
03:49:55.389 --> 03:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
truly all over the state the the the the
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh the drought's been running severe in
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state each year
 
03:50:03.229 --> 03:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh and I think the intent was to to have
 
03:50:05.450 --> 03:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
that imprint in in buy-in by the
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislature rather than have it being
 
03:50:09.889 --> 03:50:09.899 align:start position:0%
kind of an off the side program
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
um so yes correct there there are funds
 
03:50:15.889 --> 03:50:15.899 align:start position:0%
still in the trust fund uh and my guess
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:50:19.309 --> 03:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
you know we would need it if if this was
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
itl'd and nothing moved forward again
 
03:50:23.210 --> 03:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm always happy to work with any
 
03:50:25.610 --> 03:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
legislator so certainly I'd work with uh
 
03:50:27.530 --> 03:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire if you if you
 
03:50:30.650 --> 03:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
were interested uh but we'd have to go
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
back to the trust fund uh make the case
 
03:50:35.210 --> 03:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
there and and again I can't speak for
 
03:50:37.490 --> 03:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
the trust fund there's 19 Commissioners
 
03:50:41.330 --> 03:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.490 --> 03:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why money from the
 
03:50:45.410 --> 03:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
trust fund couldn't be transferred to
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
find out to finance this separate
 
03:50:47.880 --> 03:50:50.389 align:start position:0%
find out to finance this separate
program

03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:50:52.610 --> 03:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
when you say transferred is that the
 
03:50:55.790 --> 03:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
trust fund as opposed to new money new
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
this so again I'd there's a 19 person
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
commission they would need to vote right
 
03:51:05.570 --> 03:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
but if they did There's okay
 
03:51:08.450 --> 03:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
because they're recommending that this
 
03:51:12.530 --> 03:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
be created right correct
 
03:51:14.210 --> 03:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
Zen of Griffin
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
as representative herbal's point
 
03:51:21.229 --> 03:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
um I think that would take away some
 
03:51:21.239 --> 03:51:22.790 align:start position:0%
um I think that would take away some
flexibility

03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
that money would be locked up for a
 
03:51:28.010 --> 03:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
specific purpose where right now it's
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
not locked up they have some flexibility
 
03:51:37.130 --> 03:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:40.010 --> 03:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
and again I'm just thinking back to my
 
03:51:42.410 --> 03:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
conversation with former president Morse
 
03:51:44.750 --> 03:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
I think he wanted more of a legislative
 
03:51:46.849 --> 03:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
hand in this versus
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.090 --> 03:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
just to add to the discussion I think
 
03:52:01.130 --> 03:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
there are parts of the bill and parts of
 
03:52:03.889 --> 03:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
the policy that uh could be more ironed
 
03:52:06.530 --> 03:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
out to address the rule-making issues
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
that representative McGuire put together
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
and and maybe the the funding
 
03:52:12.410 --> 03:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
appropriation versus where it's coming
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
from and and how we work the the fiscal
 
03:52:17.150 --> 03:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
note out uh because it really doesn't
 
03:52:19.010 --> 03:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
show a
 
03:52:22.250 --> 03:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
planned increase in expenditures or rev
 
03:52:24.050 --> 03:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
obviously revenues both interterminal
 
03:52:24.060 --> 03:52:25.790 align:start position:0%
obviously revenues both interterminal
increase

03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:52:28.010 --> 03:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
I think it's a policy and I know we're
 
03:52:29.809 --> 03:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
not the policy committee for this
 
03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it's a policy that could
 
03:52:35.210 --> 03:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
have some wrinkles ironed out and
 
03:52:38.590 --> 03:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not if we itl this bill today
 
03:52:41.090 --> 03:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh I guess publicly for the record I
 
03:52:43.849 --> 03:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
want to say my willingness to work on
 
03:52:46.610 --> 03:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
addressing concerns in the policy
 
03:52:50.269 --> 03:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
outside of this bill maybe or whatnot in
 
03:52:52.490 --> 03:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
order to empower the commission to do
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
what they seek to do and get that
 
03:52:58.450 --> 03:52:58.460 align:start position:0%
legislative process in place
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
on the on the way that we handle this
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so if we're italing it right now
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
we're telling it maybe uh
 
03:53:10.849 --> 03:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
but I think the other underlying parts
 
03:53:14.150 --> 03:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
of it can live on somewhere else
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
potentially or we can retain and work on
 
03:53:20.690 --> 03:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
the rule making issues for the bill
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you see and
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
this is why
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's not up to us to decide
 
03:53:31.319 --> 03:53:32.150 align:start position:0%
it's not up to us to decide
um

03:53:32.150 --> 03:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
exactly who gets what under what
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
conditions and so on that's a lot of
 
03:53:39.410 --> 03:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
policy right you know maybe it's not
 
03:53:42.410 --> 03:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
just drought maybe it's also what he
 
03:53:45.050 --> 03:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
talked about storm storm damage that's
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
not a drought that's something else
 
03:53:49.610 --> 03:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
right but but you need to have in the in
 
03:53:52.729 --> 03:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
a law that spends money you need to have
 
03:53:55.070 --> 03:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
details and there's there's like nothing
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
here so that's the problem I mean I I
 
03:53:59.929 --> 03:53:59.939 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
03:54:02.750 --> 03:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
yes they can come back next year
 
03:54:06.830 --> 03:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
right with a with a more detailed bill
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
or the year after you know it doesn't
 
03:54:11.990 --> 03:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
seem like a problem
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
my only if if we itl this can they come
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
back next year with a similar policy or
 
03:54:19.370 --> 03:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
would they have to wait two years
 
03:54:20.929 --> 03:54:20.939 align:start position:0%
it would thank you for the question but
 
03:54:23.389 --> 03:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
it would have to be it's a decision of
 
03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
as to whether it was sufficiently
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
different right and I think what
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
personally I would think if it
 
03:54:34.670 --> 03:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
specifically said people you know with
 
03:54:37.969 --> 03:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
this income this much money a lot of a
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
lot more stuff that's that's
 
03:54:43.490 --> 03:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
sufficiently different okay so but it'd
 
03:54:48.110 --> 03:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:50.450 --> 03:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
all right is there any more discussion
 
03:54:52.910 --> 03:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
there is a motion on the floor of itl
 
03:54:54.650 --> 03:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
that was made by representative McGuire
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Griffin I
 
03:54:57.120 --> 03:54:58.070 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Griffin I
believe

03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:55:06.189 --> 03:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
tall enough

foreign
 
03:56:02.090 --> 03:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
McGuire you have another committee
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.450 --> 04:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:50.450 --> 04:01:50.460 align:start position:0%

Mr Hoffman a little history thanks
 
04:02:00.410 --> 04:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
the report out of resources Recreation
 
04:02:03.530 --> 04:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
and development was ought to pass with a
 
04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
vote of 20-0 and the Full House
 
04:02:14.090 --> 04:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.250 --> 04:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
all right I see representative wrong
 
04:02:22.849 --> 04:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.859 --> 04:02:35.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:02:35.929 --> 04:02:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.269 --> 04:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
we'll just wait until Mr Hoffman gets
 
04:02:38.279 --> 04:02:39.290 align:start position:0%
we'll just wait until Mr Hoffman gets
here

04:02:39.290 --> 04:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:02:42.170 --> 04:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
handout passed around
 
04:02:42.180 --> 04:02:50.750 align:start position:0%
handout passed around
oh

04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
so this Rowdy crew generally spends a
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
lot of time on the fiscal impact so
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
try to keep your comments to the fiscal
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
impact because it sounds like the policy
 
04:03:14.170 --> 04:03:14.180 align:start position:0%
committee supported it overwhelmingly
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much Mr chairman for
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Rosemary wrong I
 
04:03:19.439 --> 04:03:20.530 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Rosemary wrong I
represent

04:03:20.530 --> 04:03:20.540 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 12 which is the town of
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and I'll keep my remarks brief
 
04:03:27.889 --> 04:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
because there are two people behind me
 
04:03:30.650 --> 04:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
from Des that can speak more about the
 
04:03:33.650 --> 04:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
financing of this fund this would be
 
04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
adding two million dollars to an
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
existing fund that provides testing and
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
Remediation for pfas contamination
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
up until December I chaired the HB 737
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
commission that studied the health and
 
04:03:52.370 --> 04:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of pfas
 
04:03:55.969 --> 04:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
contamination that resulted from a
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
contamination from the Merrimac
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
operations of Sanko Bain performance
 
04:04:02.929 --> 04:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
Plastics and the commission made three
 
04:04:04.849 --> 04:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
recommendations last fall and I'll
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
report to the governor and one of them
 
04:04:09.849 --> 04:04:09.859 align:start position:0%
was to expand the on so that it can be
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
responsive to anticipated regulation
 
04:04:16.250 --> 04:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
coming from EPA this year which I just
 
04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
saw a snippet today in the news that
 
04:04:20.090 --> 04:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
that those those are going to be
 
04:04:22.429 --> 04:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
imminent so this would prepare Des to be
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
able to respond to those new standards
 
04:04:27.769 --> 04:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
also to expand the application of the
 
04:04:31.250 --> 04:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
fund since the original consent decree
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
was agreed upon between the state and
 
04:04:35.590 --> 04:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
sanco Bain
 
04:04:38.090 --> 04:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
contamination has been discovered beyond
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
the outer boundary of that consent
 
04:04:42.530 --> 04:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
degree so DS has taken responsibility
 
04:04:45.170 --> 04:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the testing and Remediation
 
04:04:47.570 --> 04:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
of those of the private Wells and
 
04:04:49.490 --> 04:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
they're working with the town of
 
04:04:53.290 --> 04:04:53.300 align:start position:0%
Londonderry on Municipal Water
 
04:04:57.290 --> 04:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
projects or initiatives
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
so essentially this two million dollars
 
04:05:02.210 --> 04:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
would be used to increase the current
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
fund and increase the application of the
 
04:05:09.469 --> 04:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
intent of the of what that fund's
 
04:05:11.150 --> 04:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
intended for
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to answer any
 
04:05:16.010 --> 04:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
questions but I do know that Mr wimsat
 
04:05:18.650 --> 04:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
and Ms Russo are behind me and they live
 
04:05:21.469 --> 04:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
this almost every day the
 
04:05:23.210 --> 04:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
I'll see if there's any questions for
 
04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
you of course thank you representative
 
04:05:25.020 --> 04:05:27.650 align:start position:0%
you of course thank you representative
Griffin

04:05:27.650 --> 04:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.370 --> 04:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
my question really goes to uh LBA I
 
04:05:31.380 --> 04:05:33.349 align:start position:0%
my question really goes to uh LBA I
think

04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
if there's an existing phone and it's
 
04:05:40.490 --> 04:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
called the pfas fund Loan Fund somewhere
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
it has to be renamed right does that
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.090 --> 04:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
yeah the bill does rename the fund to
 
04:05:53.150 --> 04:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
the pfas response fund from The Loan
 
04:05:53.160 --> 04:05:54.229 align:start position:0%
the pfas response fund from The Loan
Fund

04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
Fund
 
04:06:01.490 --> 04:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't see that in here what I see
 
04:06:03.960 --> 04:06:04.969 align:start position:0%
but I don't see that in here what I see
is

04:06:04.969 --> 04:06:04.979 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:06:07.250 --> 04:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
I see some changes but I don't see a
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
line that says
 
04:06:12.729 --> 04:06:12.739 align:start position:0%
The pfas Loan Fund will now be called
 
04:06:21.530 --> 04:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.870 --> 04:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know okay
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't read that as changing
 
04:06:27.889 --> 04:06:27.899 align:start position:0%
the fun name
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
as it says the Reese read the pfas
 
04:06:34.849 --> 04:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
response fund means
 
04:06:42.349 --> 04:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't know why it just doesn't
 
04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
it is a little confusing because loan
 
04:06:53.330 --> 04:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
response it's all providing money
 
04:06:56.570 --> 04:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
probably cut up the pie I suppose
 
04:06:59.090 --> 04:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative McGuire you had a
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
question well I just I'll just answer
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
that question so on the second page on
 
04:07:05.929 --> 04:07:05.939 align:start position:0%
line 14 you see that's that's the
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
section h10 which defines the fund right
 
04:07:15.050 --> 04:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:17.689 --> 04:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
where it says fund established you see
 
04:07:17.699 --> 04:07:26.030 align:start position:0%
where it says fund established you see
that

04:07:26.030 --> 04:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.040 --> 04:07:41.410 align:start position:0%
 
transfer

04:07:41.410 --> 04:07:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
well in 29 it says the sum of two
 
04:07:46.849 --> 04:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
million dollars for fiscal year ending
 
04:07:49.130 --> 04:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
June 30th of this year by appropriate to
 
04:07:55.490 --> 04:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:58.250 --> 04:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
yes anyone who represents Sweden thank
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr my reading of it I I'm going to
 
04:08:03.250 --> 04:08:03.260 align:start position:0%
assume RSA
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
485-8 H with the you know colon numbers
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
that is what established the Loan Fund
 
04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
and we are amending it to response fund
 
04:08:16.610 --> 04:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
without re right without needing it's
 
04:08:16.620 --> 04:08:18.769 align:start position:0%
without re right without needing it's
just

04:08:18.769 --> 04:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
so I think that the way I read it is the
 
04:08:23.170 --> 04:08:23.180 align:start position:0%
funds don't aren't moving they're just
 
04:08:28.250 --> 04:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any idea what's in that
 
04:08:32.450 --> 04:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
fund now
 
04:08:36.830 --> 04:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to defer to Mr whimsat Ms
 
04:08:39.650 --> 04:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
Russo because she administers it all
 
04:08:42.530 --> 04:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.540 --> 04:08:58.689 align:start position:0%
 
whomever

04:08:58.689 --> 04:08:58.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.699 --> 04:09:01.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:09:01.330 --> 04:09:01.340 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:09:04.010 --> 04:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Mike wimsat I
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
service director of the waste management
 
04:09:07.729 --> 04:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
division for New Hampshire Des with me
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
is Amy Russo who administers our pfas uh
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
response the the the mediation Loan Fund
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
but really is our services our pfas
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
coordinator across all of our state
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
operations addressing pfas the direct
 
04:09:22.250 --> 04:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is that there's
 
04:09:24.170 --> 04:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
approximately 22 million dollars
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
remaining in the pfas remediation Loan
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
Fund an important distinction that I
 
04:09:32.210 --> 04:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
would draw is that those funds were
 
04:09:34.370 --> 04:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
appropriated very specifically by the
 
04:09:34.380 --> 04:09:35.889 align:start position:0%
appropriated very specifically by the
legislature

04:09:35.889 --> 04:09:35.899 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:09:38.950 --> 04:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
solely for the use for for
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
administering the Loan Fund
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
administering loans that was when the
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
fund was first established about three
 
04:09:46.969 --> 04:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
years ago in the next year the
 
04:09:49.370 --> 04:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
legislature the the the statute was
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
amended to provide the authority to also
 
04:09:56.689 --> 04:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
make grants from The Loan Fund but that
 
04:09:58.729 --> 04:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
initial appropriation that was not
 
04:10:02.210 --> 04:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
amended so we see that as being solely
 
04:10:03.889 --> 04:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
there and available to make loans and
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
those loans would be made to eligible
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
water systems for improvements that have
 
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
been impacted by pfas contamination to
 
04:10:12.349 --> 04:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
make improvements and install treatment
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
to address the pfas contamination
 
04:10:16.250 --> 04:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
subsequently there was money
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated to make grants and so we
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
and that is largely spoken for the
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
grants are as they often are very
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
popular there's a lot of water systems a
 
04:10:28.010 --> 04:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
lot of small community water systems and
 
04:10:30.110 --> 04:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
and larger public water systems that had
 
04:10:32.090 --> 04:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
to spend a lot of money to address pfas
 
04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
contamination so that's largely
 
04:10:36.889 --> 04:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
accounted for and then in the next year
 
04:10:39.969 --> 04:10:39.979 align:start position:0%
the legislature the
 
04:10:43.130 --> 04:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
statute was further amended to provide
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
Authority for Des to administer a very
 
04:10:50.809 --> 04:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
specific pfas mediation rebate program
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
and that program is to provide rebates
 
04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
of up to five thousand dollars per
 
04:10:56.160 --> 04:10:57.189 align:start position:0%
of up to five thousand dollars per
property

04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
for any any property owner whose private
 
04:11:02.210 --> 04:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
well is impact affected by pfas
 
04:11:04.969 --> 04:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
contamination can get is eligible to get
 
04:11:06.889 --> 04:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
if they're not being addressed by a
 
04:11:08.809 --> 04:11:08.819 align:start position:0%
responsible party and not being provided
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
with alternate Water by another party
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
then they're eligible to apply for a
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
rebate to offset their own costs
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
incurred to put treatment on their well
 
04:11:20.570 --> 04:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
to address pfas contamination or if
 
04:11:22.130 --> 04:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
they're fortunate enough to live close
 
04:11:24.769 --> 04:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
to a public water system close enough to
 
04:11:27.050 --> 04:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
connect in without a large expenditure
 
04:11:29.090 --> 04:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
they can get up to a ten thousand dollar
 
04:11:31.010 --> 04:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
rebate to offset the cost of that
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
connection so that's a lot more than
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
maybe you're counting on but that's
 
04:11:37.010 --> 04:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's where this is at right now
 
04:11:38.750 --> 04:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
so that would lead me to the question
 
04:11:41.210 --> 04:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
you said there's 22 million dollars
 
04:11:44.929 --> 04:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
right now available in this other fund
 
04:11:48.050 --> 04:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
rough layer no so yeah so this bill
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
would as as the committee has discussed
 
04:11:52.969 --> 04:11:52.979 align:start position:0%
here change the name of the fund to the
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
pfas response fund and that's not just
 
04:11:55.319 --> 04:11:56.150 align:start position:0%
pfas response fund and that's not just
to

04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:11:58.610 --> 04:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
give it another name is to expand its
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
scope to include the ability to use
 
04:12:02.750 --> 04:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
funds that are appropriated for that
 
04:12:05.809 --> 04:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
purpose to do additional work to
 
04:12:08.330 --> 04:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
determine occurrence of pfas whether
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's soil or
 
04:12:13.630 --> 04:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
um uh you know fish or or you know
 
04:12:16.729 --> 04:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
basically all the other or air basically
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
we've had to spend a lot of resources as
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
best we could to evaluate the occurrence
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
of pfas across the whole environment not
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
just drinking water and we basically had
 
04:12:29.630 --> 04:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
about a six million dollar appropriation
 
04:12:31.610 --> 04:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
that was dedicated to that that is
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
lapsing at the end of this fiscal year
 
04:12:35.210 --> 04:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
so in just three through four months
 
04:12:37.610 --> 04:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
here so we will no longer have funds
 
04:12:40.429 --> 04:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
available that are dedicated to doing
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
the kind of work we've been doing we you
 
04:12:45.170 --> 04:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
know we we've been directed to uh by the
 
04:12:46.849 --> 04:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
legislature to establish soil
 
04:12:49.490 --> 04:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
remediation standards and we had to do a
 
04:12:51.050 --> 04:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
lot of work to educate ourselves about
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
the occurrence in soil understand how
 
04:12:56.689 --> 04:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
the pfas behaves in soil so we used
 
04:13:00.050 --> 04:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from that six million to
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
do some of the studies in the work the
 
04:13:03.410 --> 04:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
background work that we needed to do to
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
understand what we need in order to to
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
do a good job setting an appropriate
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
soil standard we've also used those
 
04:13:13.630 --> 04:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
funds again for fish tissue studies
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
shellfish tissue studies in the Great
 
04:13:19.849 --> 04:13:19.859 align:start position:0%
Bay and a number of other and also our
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
bile solids program has used these funds
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
to essentially
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
um study land application of wastewater
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
treatment sludges what's coming into and
 
04:13:33.410 --> 04:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
going out of wastewater treatment plants
 
04:13:35.330 --> 04:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
so that's a separate money that's going
 
04:13:37.370 --> 04:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
away what I think this bill is trying to
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
do is say okay this pfaster mediation
 
04:13:41.689 --> 04:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund which up to now is only
 
04:13:43.490 --> 04:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
available for making loans and grants
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
for very specific purposes that are tied
 
04:13:48.429 --> 04:13:48.439 align:start position:0%
solely to drinking water
 
04:13:51.170 --> 04:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
and and also Wastewater but those are
 
04:13:53.469 --> 04:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
the two areas that it can go to
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
this is trying to broaden the scope of
 
04:13:57.769 --> 04:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
it so that funds that are appropriated
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
for for that purpose can also be
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
deposited to this fund and used for that
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
additional work that we've been doing
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
using the six million dollars that is
 
04:14:10.130 --> 04:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
now lapsing basically
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
represent a Sweeney followed by
 
04:14:13.849 --> 04:14:13.859 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler thank you Mr
 
04:14:15.170 --> 04:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you both for being here
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
to take our questions so I'm reading the
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
physical note and it's a two million
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation from fiscal year 23
 
04:14:22.990 --> 04:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned the Six Million Dollar
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation that laps in the current
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
fund and the funding source is general
 
04:14:31.729 --> 04:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
and the pfas response fund so but what
 
04:14:33.889 --> 04:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
you just said I gather the 22 million
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
dollars without legislation goes down to
 
04:14:37.969 --> 04:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
16 million dollars
 
04:14:40.250 --> 04:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
by June and then this would really just
 
04:14:43.490 --> 04:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
bring it back to 18 or no no we're
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
talking about and I apologize it's
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
confusing it's two separate pots of
 
04:14:48.650 --> 04:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
money The Six Million never went into
 
04:14:50.030 --> 04:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
this fund that is a separate
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was appropriated
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
directly to the department
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
um and we budgeted for it and it's in
 
04:14:57.170 --> 04:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
our but it's in our it's in our
 
04:14:58.610 --> 04:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
04:15:00.889 --> 04:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
um so so the the important I think thing
 
04:15:03.050 --> 04:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
thing to understand is that
 
04:15:04.969 --> 04:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
while there have been funds appropriated
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
to this fund they are all specifically
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
have ties to the the original 50 million
 
04:15:14.090 --> 04:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
which is now 22 million we're solely for
 
04:15:16.729 --> 04:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
loans to Water Systems the grant
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
allocation was solely to water systems
 
04:15:22.370 --> 04:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
for for for for making improvements to
 
04:15:25.010 --> 04:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
address pfas there are no funds in this
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
fund as it's currently comprised that
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
are allowed to be used for those broader
 
04:15:29.520 --> 04:15:31.790 align:start position:0%
are allowed to be used for those broader
purposes

04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:15:35.150 --> 04:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
for other question oh thank you and an
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
apologies this might be a question for
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
LBA or someone else but
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
so this bill doesn't change the
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines on the 22 million dollar
 
04:15:47.450 --> 04:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
appropriation right there's still going
 
04:15:49.849 --> 04:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
to be four loans and this two million
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
dollars will be for Grants yes that's
 
04:15:54.170 --> 04:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
correct uh no this wouldn't necessarily
 
04:15:56.150 --> 04:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
be for Grants this would be money it
 
04:15:57.309 --> 04:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
could be used
 
04:15:59.689 --> 04:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
no this would be really for operating
 
04:16:02.090 --> 04:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
expenses to do or it could be for
 
04:16:04.010 --> 04:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
contractual for example if we are a
 
04:16:06.170 --> 04:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
contractor to sample shellfish or
 
04:16:07.969 --> 04:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
something like that is could be used for
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
a lot I'll give you an example
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
um and one of the the real benefits of
 
04:16:14.450 --> 04:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
having this kind of money available is
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
that we can Leverage The Investments get
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
a lot more in return for example about
 
04:16:21.170 --> 04:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
ninety thousand dollars of this six
 
04:16:23.210 --> 04:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
million was provided to Dartmouth
 
04:16:23.220 --> 04:16:24.590 align:start position:0%
million was provided to Dartmouth
College

04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
College
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
um to as part of a half a million dollar
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
study on fish tissue and and shellfish
 
04:16:32.809 --> 04:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
so we're going to get all the data
 
04:16:34.250 --> 04:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
associated with a half a million dollar
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
study for a 90 000 investment so um the
 
04:16:41.090 --> 04:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
the real Advantage the real problem
 
04:16:42.769 --> 04:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
we're having right now is with this six
 
04:16:45.050 --> 04:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
million lapsing we're not in a position
 
04:16:47.090 --> 04:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
to do this kind of work moving forward
 
04:16:48.530 --> 04:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any funding
 
04:16:51.650 --> 04:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
sources that um are are useful are
 
04:16:55.689 --> 04:16:55.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler followed by
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
Griffin and Evil
 
04:17:01.370 --> 04:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
so we've got everybody in the in the
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
whole population stirred up about the
 
04:17:07.729 --> 04:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
dangers of pfas which is so prevalent we
 
04:17:09.290 --> 04:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
probably all have it in our body anyway
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
we do but you have failed to do any
 
04:17:12.479 --> 04:17:14.030 align:start position:0%
we do but you have failed to do any
examination

04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
examination
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
in the population of the blood the
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
amount of everybody's blood especially
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
looking at firemen who are most exposed
 
04:17:25.130 --> 04:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
that that's a big remiss and a few years
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
ago I called up and said why are we the
 
04:17:29.450 --> 04:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
lowest at 12 parts per trillion which to
 
04:17:32.090 --> 04:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
me is infinitesimal 12 parts per
 
04:17:34.010 --> 04:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
trillion and I was referred to some PhD
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
named Jonathan I can't remember his name
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
and I said can you refer me to the data
 
04:17:41.929 --> 04:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
or the study that that supports 12 parts
 
04:17:43.250 --> 04:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
per trillion
 
04:17:45.830 --> 04:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
and he didn't he just said look it up
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
04:17:49.610 --> 04:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
that to me means there isn't one it's
 
04:17:50.929 --> 04:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
just BS
 
04:17:52.969 --> 04:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to go and say oh
 
04:17:54.590 --> 04:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
we've got to do something spend billions
 
04:17:56.990 --> 04:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
of dollars cleaning out pfast which we
 
04:17:59.809 --> 04:17:59.819 align:start position:0%
never can because it's so prevalent
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
you need to do data among our population
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
to assure them and take a look at the
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
health of people especially Saint Cobain
 
04:18:09.650 --> 04:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
and firemen to come and come and tell us
 
04:18:11.929 --> 04:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
what have been the effects and has
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
anybody found a way to treat it and has
 
04:18:16.130 --> 04:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
it been successful
 
04:18:18.530 --> 04:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
like sometimes chelation and things like
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
this have removed these sorts of things
 
04:18:21.530 --> 04:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
from our body
 
04:18:23.450 --> 04:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's what you should be do spending
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
this money on not saying oh we've got to
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
fix this water system we've got to fix
 
04:18:28.969 --> 04:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
that water system to this ridiculous 12
 
04:18:32.150 --> 04:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion when arsenic can be
 
04:18:34.729 --> 04:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
20 parts per million that's a million
 
04:18:35.929 --> 04:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
times more
 
04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
and yet we got it all excited in
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
spending millions of dollars and you
 
04:18:42.769 --> 04:18:42.779 align:start position:0%
haven't given us any reason
 
04:18:45.889 --> 04:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
that there's a real health problem I'm
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
really glad you asked that question
 
04:18:50.929 --> 04:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler um and there's a
 
04:18:52.729 --> 04:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
lot to unpack there but I'll try to try
 
04:18:54.889 --> 04:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
to answer as as in a helpful way if I
 
04:18:54.899 --> 04:18:56.030 align:start position:0%
to answer as as in a helpful way if I
can

04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I agree there's a lot of information
 
04:18:59.870 --> 04:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
out there that that is you know
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when something like this
 
04:19:03.530 --> 04:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
hits the news there's an article every
 
04:19:06.290 --> 04:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
day every day there's a new allegation
 
04:19:08.450 --> 04:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
that it's toilet paper or it's whatever
 
04:19:09.769 --> 04:19:09.779 align:start position:0%
you know every day there's a new thing
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that's loaded with pfast that's
 
04:19:13.610 --> 04:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
killing us and that's one of the reasons
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
that we've elected to do is careful of
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
study as we can on specific issues so
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
that we can sort through that because we
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
can't rely on the media to tell us what
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
the problems are and and there's so many
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
people some who are really not reliable
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
doing studies and Publishing studies
 
04:19:31.490 --> 04:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
that it becomes very difficult so
 
04:19:32.689 --> 04:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
there's a certain
 
04:19:35.570 --> 04:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
a requirement for us to and frankly in
 
04:19:37.010 --> 04:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this nobody was doing
 
04:19:39.290 --> 04:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
much work so we were you know here we
 
04:19:40.610 --> 04:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
were a little New Hampshire but we had
 
04:19:42.530 --> 04:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
this outsized problem in Southern New
 
04:19:44.269 --> 04:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the emissions from a
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
particular facility and um we really had
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
to get these answers quickly so we were
 
04:19:50.689 --> 04:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
we weren't doing blood testing and I'll
 
04:19:52.849 --> 04:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
speak to that in a moment but we spent
 
04:19:55.189 --> 04:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
whatever resources we had immediately we
 
04:19:58.490 --> 04:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
had Des staff knocking on doors on the
 
04:20:01.130 --> 04:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
weekend you know offering to sample
 
04:20:03.110 --> 04:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
people's Wells because suddenly we
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
realized we had a problem that was much
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
greater than we ever had seen before
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
because of the air emissions nature of
 
04:20:11.410 --> 04:20:11.420 align:start position:0%
how this was emitted it had
 
04:20:14.150 --> 04:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
impacted Wells as we later learned over
 
04:20:16.010 --> 04:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
dozens of square miles and we don't have
 
04:20:17.330 --> 04:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
any sites like that in New Hampshire
 
04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
that have done anything like that
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
they're all much more localized so um
 
04:20:24.530 --> 04:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
with regard to the the standard I'm
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
sorry I I hope you didn't get that kind
 
04:20:28.490 --> 04:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
of a response we do have staff who have
 
04:20:30.650 --> 04:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
worked very hard done the science on
 
04:20:33.110 --> 04:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
this and and I will I'll push firstly
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
make sure you get in touch with someone
 
04:20:37.070 --> 04:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
who can sit down with you and walk you
 
04:20:39.290 --> 04:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
through how we develop that standard I
 
04:20:40.490 --> 04:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
will tell you there are a number of
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
other states that have developed
 
04:20:43.189 --> 04:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
standards that are much in line with
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the uscpa right now is working on a
 
04:20:47.689 --> 04:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
proposed standard that must maybe much
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
lower than that and we're going to look
 
04:20:50.809 --> 04:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
at that we're going to try to understand
 
04:20:53.290 --> 04:20:53.300 align:start position:0%
that when that proposal comes
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
but the advantage of having the ability
 
04:20:59.929 --> 04:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
to well I want to go to the issue of
 
04:21:01.370 --> 04:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
blood testing so that's not something
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
that has really been in Des as well
 
04:21:05.689 --> 04:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse before we sample water we
 
04:21:07.250 --> 04:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
sample soil and drinking water and
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
wastewater we don't draw blood and take
 
04:21:11.510 --> 04:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
blood samples from people the Department
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services has done
 
04:21:16.189 --> 04:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
that to some degree maybe not to the
 
04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
satisfaction of some communities and
 
04:21:20.689 --> 04:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
also on the Sea Coast because of this
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
issue that occurred at peace Tradeport
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
which was actually our first discovery
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
of this back in 2014 our Congressional
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
Delegation has allocated federal funds
 
04:21:31.370 --> 04:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
to do blood testing and there have been
 
04:21:33.889 --> 04:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
efforts to do blood testing of folks who
 
04:21:35.809 --> 04:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
worked on the trade Port over the last
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
40 years or so so there is work I I'll
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
be quick to say it's probably not enough
 
04:21:42.769 --> 04:21:42.779 align:start position:0%
but again that's not in our wheelhouse
 
04:21:45.290 --> 04:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
we're not Public Health experts follow
 
04:21:45.300 --> 04:21:46.429 align:start position:0%
we're not Public Health experts follow
up

04:21:46.429 --> 04:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
so when I did look up the available uh
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
studies at the time
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
they were all about mice and other
 
04:21:55.920 --> 04:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
they were all about mice and other
Critters

04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
Critters
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
and almost every one of them at the time
 
04:22:01.250 --> 04:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
I read them a few years ago said human
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
studies need to be done
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
so maybe they've been done since but I
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
haven't really looked up to see but if
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
human studies haven't need to be done
 
04:22:13.610 --> 04:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
why do we assume we're in danger
 
04:22:16.130 --> 04:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
and if I may and I want to I want to
 
04:22:17.929 --> 04:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
preface my remarks by saying I'm not a
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
toxicologist so these are not expert
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
remarks for me but what but I've been
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
living this since 2016 on a daily basis
 
04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
and and talking to the folks who do know
 
04:22:29.330 --> 04:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
and what I'll tell you a couple things
 
04:22:31.370 --> 04:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
first of all it's not very satisfying
 
04:22:34.729 --> 04:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
but many of the standards that we we put
 
04:22:37.010 --> 04:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
on drinking water or soil you know
 
04:22:39.769 --> 04:22:39.779 align:start position:0%
contact whatever it might be are based
 
04:22:41.150 --> 04:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
on animal studies that's because we
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
don't we don't do studies on humans
 
04:22:45.170 --> 04:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
right we so the only time we get human
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
data is when we have an exposed
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
population and in the case of pfas we do
 
04:22:51.410 --> 04:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
have a couple of very significant
 
04:22:53.809 --> 04:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
exposed populations that occurred down
 
04:22:56.210 --> 04:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
in West Virginia and the Ohio Valley
 
04:22:56.220 --> 04:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
in West Virginia and the Ohio Valley
um

04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:59.150 --> 04:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
well right and and that that study
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done yet but these were
 
04:23:02.090 --> 04:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
people who were near a plant that
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
manufactured these compounds and had it
 
04:23:06.530 --> 04:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
in their drinking water and it was a
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
large study it was somewhere on the
 
04:23:10.729 --> 04:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
order of I think oh gosh I think there's
 
04:23:12.650 --> 04:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
over 80 000 people that were involved in
 
04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
the study so that's that's big they
 
04:23:16.990 --> 04:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
weren't able to draw as often happens
 
04:23:19.969 --> 04:23:19.979 align:start position:0%
absolute conclusions and causality but
 
04:23:22.370 --> 04:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
they did see associations in the
 
04:23:24.889 --> 04:23:24.899 align:start position:0%
exposure the exposed population with the
 
04:23:26.990 --> 04:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
occurrence of certain disease and health
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
impacts so that often that's As Good As
 
04:23:33.290 --> 04:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
It Gets In terms of confidence level for
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
something so again I'm not going to
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
defend that because I it's not my area
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
of expertise but we we do have a
 
04:23:42.530 --> 04:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
combination of intensive animal studies
 
04:23:44.150 --> 04:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
that have been done and some
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
epidemiological data in humans and the
 
04:23:49.010 --> 04:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
experts who know a lot more than this
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
about this than me when they evaluated
 
04:23:53.150 --> 04:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
all of that and it's not just New
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're not on our own on this
 
04:23:57.769 --> 04:23:57.779 align:start position:0%
we relied on the the work of a number of
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
other states and and we and we were
 
04:24:02.150 --> 04:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
working to develop these numbers we also
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
brought in we hired a toxicologist who
 
04:24:07.130 --> 04:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
works for the agency but we also hired a
 
04:24:08.929 --> 04:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
contract toxicologist very bright guys
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
Steve Roberts from from the University
 
04:24:13.969 --> 04:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
of Florida who who consulted with us on
 
04:24:16.490 --> 04:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
this so we had a lot of very high power
 
04:24:18.530 --> 04:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
people working on this and at the end of
 
04:24:21.170 --> 04:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
the day that's where we landed um and
 
04:24:22.729 --> 04:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
that you know and it's hard to imagine I
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
think that it's hard to wrap your head
 
04:24:25.790 --> 04:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
around how something could be so
 
04:24:28.010 --> 04:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
dangerous at parts per trillion but the
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
problem with pfas as I understand it is
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
that unlike a lot of other contaminants
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
that kind of hide out in the body fat
 
04:24:35.809 --> 04:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
and don't really sort of interact with
 
04:24:37.790 --> 04:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
your metabolism and that's a that's a
 
04:24:40.490 --> 04:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
Layman's way of describing it pfas is in
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
the blood which means it gets
 
04:24:43.849 --> 04:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
distributed throughout your body it gets
 
04:24:45.710 --> 04:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
in contact with all your organs because
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
your blood is your is your
 
04:24:49.250 --> 04:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
transportation system for the body so as
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
a result and when you talk about it in
 
04:24:52.849 --> 04:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
drinking water where you even though
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's a small amount you know the average
 
04:24:57.410 --> 04:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
human is drinking you know through food
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
and drink and everything else getting a
 
04:25:01.250 --> 04:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
couple liters or more a day of water it
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
adds up and the problem the other
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
problem with these compounds that make
 
04:25:06.410 --> 04:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
them separate from other contaminants is
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
that they're so durable the pfas can
 
04:25:11.450 --> 04:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
compound the carbon fluorine Bond just
 
04:25:13.849 --> 04:25:13.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't go away it doesn't break down so
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know the pfast that you ate or drank
 
04:25:19.010 --> 04:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
10 years ago you know a good portion but
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
still in your body today which isn't
 
04:25:22.670 --> 04:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
true any of this money go toward human
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
studies like maybe through Dartmouth
 
04:25:27.290 --> 04:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
medical school if we were directed to do
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
that we again we don't necessarily see
 
04:25:32.450 --> 04:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
that as our area of expertise but
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
certainly if the legislature saw fit to
 
04:25:37.490 --> 04:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
allocate Monies to Des that would be
 
04:25:39.649 --> 04:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
used to work in concert with our Health
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
Partners or or maybe directly to the AHS
 
04:25:45.170 --> 04:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
who was also a partner with us in this
 
04:25:47.330 --> 04:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
fight against these these compounds and
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
we certainly we we'd be happy to pursue
 
04:25:52.389 --> 04:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin you know thank
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:25:58.800 --> 04:25:59.450 align:start position:0%
the question
um

04:25:59.450 --> 04:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:01.729 --> 04:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
it was a little confusing when you got
 
04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
into the operating fund versus the
 
04:26:06.889 --> 04:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
b-fest on sure but I think what you've
 
04:26:08.689 --> 04:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
told us is
 
04:26:13.250 --> 04:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
that the original pfas Loan Fund
 
04:26:16.849 --> 04:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
as some 22 million dollars in it
 
04:26:20.389 --> 04:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
and this law is broadening the use of
 
04:26:21.530 --> 04:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
that money
 
04:26:24.530 --> 04:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
so that it can be used
 
04:26:27.250 --> 04:26:27.260 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
04:26:30.050 --> 04:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
investigation testing and monitoring I
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
think that's almost right I believe that
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
what this law would do would be to
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
broaden the scope of available of
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
eligible activities to use this fund for
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
but the 22 million dollars as we read it
 
04:26:44.809 --> 04:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
was specifically appropriated for loans
 
04:26:46.250 --> 04:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
and we don't believe that even if this
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill passes we could use that 22 million
 
04:26:52.670 --> 04:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
for the broad and scope of capability of
 
04:26:55.070 --> 04:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
of of eligible activities in this bill
 
04:26:56.769 --> 04:26:56.779 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
as we see it if the bill passes it would
 
04:27:03.530 --> 04:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
make the fund in and of itself a broader
 
04:27:06.530 --> 04:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
have a more comprehensive scope but in
 
04:27:08.769 --> 04:27:08.779 align:start position:0%
order to do those additional compreh
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
additional activities that would need to
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
be an additional appropriation that was
 
04:27:17.090 --> 04:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:20.450 --> 04:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
so you're not anticipating having two
 
04:27:23.389 --> 04:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
separate funds you have one fund no no
 
04:27:25.490 --> 04:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
sir that that's exactly right and and
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of um examples of this in
 
04:27:29.809 --> 04:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
state government there are dedicated
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
funds that have a broad broad categories
 
04:27:37.070 --> 04:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
of usage but individual amounts may be
 
04:27:38.990 --> 04:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated to that fund that have a
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
more narrow scope and we have systems in
 
04:27:43.849 --> 04:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
place for managing that so that we don't
 
04:27:46.490 --> 04:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
try you know we don't have using monies
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
from the wrong Pots if you will I I
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
understand I I read you clearly right so
 
04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
my last question is my really my first
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
question I'm the state treasurer sitting
 
04:28:02.269 --> 04:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
down there with this fund and you come
 
04:28:05.210 --> 04:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
to me and say you got to rename the fun
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to make it the response
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
fund well you got to create a response
 
04:28:14.090 --> 04:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
fund and transfer the money to it where
 
04:28:15.889 --> 04:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
is the Authority for that I don't see
 
04:28:21.530 --> 04:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I will tell you I'm not a
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian expert here my my
 
04:28:26.889 --> 04:28:26.899 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the bill
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that by saying that the the
 
04:28:33.290 --> 04:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that establishes the
 
04:28:33.300 --> 04:28:34.189 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that establishes the
fund

04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:28:36.110 --> 04:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
is amended to change the name of the
 
04:28:37.729 --> 04:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
fund I think essentially by action of
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
law if this bill were to pass the front
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
the pfas rlf wouldn't would no longer
 
04:28:44.330 --> 04:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
exist and it would be called the pfas
 
04:28:46.969 --> 04:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
response fund and it would just the
 
04:28:48.950 --> 04:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
monies remain in the fund as they are
 
04:28:51.170 --> 04:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
the treasurer essentially manages those
 
04:28:54.349 --> 04:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
funds in aggregate but the agency would
 
04:28:55.849 --> 04:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
through its internal accounting
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
procedures ensure that it only expended
 
04:29:00.590 --> 04:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
the individual pots of money in the fund
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
percent of evil
 
04:29:09.889 --> 04:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
had so much discussion since I thought
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
of my question I gotta just kind of
 
04:29:13.370 --> 04:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
think of it here I think you asked a lot
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the questions I guess
 
04:29:18.410 --> 04:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
um regardless of the amount that's
 
04:29:21.110 --> 04:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated whether it was 2 million or
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
1 million or zero million and I'm not
 
04:29:25.969 --> 04:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
saying it should be zero million is it
 
04:29:28.130 --> 04:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
you're feeling that this bill should
 
04:29:30.290 --> 04:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
pass because you really want to change
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
the scope of the fund
 
04:29:36.830 --> 04:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah the verbiage because right thank
 
04:29:39.170 --> 04:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes we we in our in
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
our original testimony in the policy
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
committee you know as you heard from
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott we're just really not
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
taking positions on Appropriations
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
generally this session
 
04:29:49.610 --> 04:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
um but with respect to the policy
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
aspects of this yes we think it's
 
04:29:53.689 --> 04:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
important that this fund
 
04:29:54.889 --> 04:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
um be
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that its uses be broadened so that we
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
have a clear directive really what it
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
gives us is a directive from the
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
legislature that yes doing this work is
 
04:30:04.729 --> 04:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
important work and that when the six
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars was appropriated that's
 
04:30:08.210 --> 04:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
what we got from the from the
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislature we've got a directive that
 
04:30:12.110 --> 04:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
we want you to go and use this money to
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
learn more and understand the occurrence
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
of pfas understand the exposure Pathways
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
to humans so that you can make good
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
policy and and come to the legislature
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
if laws need to be changed and advise
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature on what you think needs
 
04:30:26.090 --> 04:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
to happen so yes we we think that this
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
would essentially renew that directive
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
even if it you know didn't initially
 
04:30:33.410 --> 04:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
come with with funding
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
further question so we keep asking and I
 
04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
think we're all sort of figuring it out
 
04:30:41.210 --> 04:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
on our own so the 22 million you really
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
consider kind of locked down for loans
 
04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
and grants that's correct and Loans only
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
loans sort of but is that in statute are
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
you just if you go back to the law that
 
04:30:54.769 --> 04:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
appropriated the money it says 50
 
04:30:56.689 --> 04:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
million dollars shall be appropriated to
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
make loans to eligible Water Systems
 
04:31:00.170 --> 04:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
right so we think that's pretty clear
 
04:31:02.809 --> 04:31:02.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up and this bill doesn't change
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe it does no okay
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
just one more and then so the 2 million
 
04:31:10.849 --> 04:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
really is to kind of take the place of
 
04:31:14.090 --> 04:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
the 6 million which you've used that's a
 
04:31:15.349 --> 04:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a reasonable way to look
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
at it yes okay
 
04:31:18.410 --> 04:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:20.450 --> 04:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so um I I think we
 
04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
should retain this bill
 
04:31:25.979 --> 04:31:26.590 align:start position:0%
should retain this bill
um

04:31:26.590 --> 04:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:29.389 --> 04:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
and put this most of this language of
 
04:31:33.050 --> 04:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
the renaming Etc into House Bill 2 and
 
04:31:36.170 --> 04:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
decide on the money because
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
um if we I we don't necessarily have to
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
keep all 22 million for loans let me ask
 
04:31:46.490 --> 04:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
this question how much did how much loan
 
04:31:49.550 --> 04:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
funds did you originally have when was
 
04:31:51.530 --> 04:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
that occur how much have you loaned out
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
to get to the 22 million do you want to
 
04:31:55.490 --> 04:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
speak to that Amy because that's your
 
04:31:58.189 --> 04:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
your expertise yeah so the original loan
 
04:32:00.889 --> 04:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
amount was 50 million dollars
 
04:32:04.130 --> 04:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
um we have to date loaned out
 
04:32:07.010 --> 04:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
approximately 23 or we've approved 23
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
million in loan today so we have 22
 
04:32:11.330 --> 04:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
million left
 
04:32:14.210 --> 04:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
we have need for that 22 million but in
 
04:32:16.610 --> 04:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
the interim as Mike has described we
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
have the ability to now give grants and
 
04:32:21.050 --> 04:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
we've received appropriation for Grants
 
04:32:24.410 --> 04:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
so that grant money has been moving
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
faster than the loan money so now that
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
the grant money is mostly allocated
 
04:32:31.250 --> 04:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
um most of the applicants that are going
 
04:32:33.110 --> 04:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be coming in in the future will be
 
04:32:35.389 --> 04:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
taking loan those loan funds rather than
 
04:32:36.769 --> 04:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
Grant funds
 
04:32:39.290 --> 04:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
so someone can have one or the other but
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
not both is that the way it works so the
 
04:32:42.649 --> 04:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
way that the program is set up through
 
04:32:46.250 --> 04:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
statue is that grants go out first to a
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
total of 1.5 million dollars or 30 of
 
04:32:51.649 --> 04:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
the total cost of the project whichever
 
04:32:54.050 --> 04:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
is greater so most of the grants that we
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
have given to date have been that 1.5
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars there are a few that are
 
04:33:01.969 --> 04:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
at the 30 percent
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so we we give the grant first and
 
04:33:05.449 --> 04:33:05.459 align:start position:0%
then if the total cost of the project is
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
greater that is then given out in loan
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
when did you start with 50 million
 
04:33:15.051 --> 04:33:15.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
um you said 20 you've loaned out 23
 
04:33:22.849 --> 04:33:22.859 align:start position:0%
and you have 22 left from 50. so there's
 
04:33:28.369 --> 04:33:28.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.810 --> 04:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
I mean I've got my
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
04:33:33.529 --> 04:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so there is 22 million
 
04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
left left okay I am a certain so you
 
04:33:37.730 --> 04:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
went out so 28 this has been loaned yeah
 
04:33:39.650 --> 04:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
yeah and when will it but that'll be
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
paid back and go back into the fund yes
 
04:33:44.570 --> 04:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
that is the intent yes as those loans
 
04:33:46.849 --> 04:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
are being repaid it would go back into
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
the fund are they 10-year loans or what
 
04:33:51.789 --> 04:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
are they uh 20 or 30 years depending on
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:59.570 --> 04:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'll second that motion
 
04:34:01.490 --> 04:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
okay the Motions been made by
 
04:34:03.410 --> 04:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire second if I
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
representative evil is there a
 
04:34:05.879 --> 04:34:07.670 align:start position:0%
representative evil is there a
discussion

04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:34:10.131 --> 04:34:10.141 align:start position:0%
sure representative rules thank you Mr
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
chair uh going back to the six million
 
04:34:14.810 --> 04:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
dollars has that been is completely
 
04:34:17.631 --> 04:34:17.641 align:start position:0%
exhausted or is it gonna you said it was
 
04:34:20.810 --> 04:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
going to lapse in June if so how much
 
04:34:22.730 --> 04:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
money is left in that account
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
so it is it is going to lapse in June we
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
are on schedule to expend all of the Six
 
04:34:29.810 --> 04:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
Million you're going to spend it all yes
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
okay and back to uh representative
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
McGuire's question uh in terms of the
 
04:34:36.769 --> 04:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
loans that have been made have them have
 
04:34:38.570 --> 04:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
they been getting paid back or do you
 
04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
have defaults and if so what percentage
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
of default do you have on the loans so
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
none are in repayment at this point the
 
04:34:48.529 --> 04:34:48.539 align:start position:0%
projects are still ongoing
 
04:34:49.849 --> 04:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
either they have not started
 
04:34:51.650 --> 04:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
construction or they're in construction
 
04:34:51.660 --> 04:34:55.250 align:start position:0%
construction or they're in construction
now

04:34:55.250 --> 04:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
I just have one question where did all
 
04:34:59.449 --> 04:34:59.459 align:start position:0%
the initial money come from
 
04:35:02.410 --> 04:35:02.420 align:start position:0%
was that some federal money state money
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
something from Saint colbain the initial
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
50 million for the loans no that was a
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
or by bonding it was at this part of
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
primary capital budget
 
04:35:18.769 --> 04:35:18.779 align:start position:0%
can I just file so uh the grant money it
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
was also put in this fund
 
04:35:25.010 --> 04:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct and I'm top of my
 
04:35:26.209 --> 04:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
head you have those grant numbers on
 
04:35:29.090 --> 04:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
your head yes so um last legislative
 
04:35:32.570 --> 04:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
session 25 million was appropriated for
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
the grant portion of this
 
04:35:37.490 --> 04:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and as Mike had mentioned earlier the
 
04:35:39.529 --> 04:35:39.539 align:start position:0%
rebate program was added to the statute
 
04:35:42.410 --> 04:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
so that 25 million of Grant where some
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
of it's towards the grant towards the
 
04:35:46.369 --> 04:35:46.379 align:start position:0%
pfas remediation Loan Fund some of it we
 
04:35:48.769 --> 04:35:48.779 align:start position:0%
are using for the rebate program
 
04:35:52.369 --> 04:35:52.379 align:start position:0%
was that also bonded
 
04:35:54.349 --> 04:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
that was a general fund Surplus
 
04:35:54.359 --> 04:35:57.410 align:start position:0%
that was a general fund Surplus
appropriation

04:35:57.410 --> 04:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.429 --> 04:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.689 --> 04:36:07.699 align:start position:0%
describing I think it would help us
 
04:36:10.250 --> 04:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people so immersed in
 
04:36:11.929 --> 04:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
this they know it like the back of their
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
hands but when we're looking at this I
 
04:36:17.090 --> 04:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
know I would find that helpful
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
you've given us a lot of information in
 
04:36:21.949 --> 04:36:21.959 align:start position:0%
the half an hour or so thanks I
 
04:36:24.289 --> 04:36:24.299 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we're lucky to have both
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
of you by the way very I've known
 
04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
Michael a long time
 
04:36:30.890 --> 04:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
lucky to have his expertise
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
so we do have a motion uh to retain it's
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
been moved and seconded when the clerk
 
04:36:38.090 --> 04:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
is ready please call the roll or just
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
have a show of hands with her it's going
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
to stay within the division so everybody
 
04:36:44.570 --> 04:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
okay with retain
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's unanimous thank you we'll look
 
04:36:48.289 --> 04:36:48.299 align:start position:0%
forward to your
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
several paragraphs that's your early
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:47.631 --> 04:37:47.641 align:start position:0%
also um let's see representative rung is
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
still here so this is uh house bill 276.
 
04:37:55.609 --> 04:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman if we could have a quick
 
04:37:58.250 --> 04:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
docket history please
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes House Bill 276
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
came out of the resources Recreation
 
04:38:08.209 --> 04:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
and development committee with ought to
 
04:38:11.929 --> 04:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment a vote of 17-3
 
04:38:15.051 --> 04:38:15.061 align:start position:0%
and then it
 
04:38:18.410 --> 04:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
passed the Full House on a vote of 199
 
04:38:26.029 --> 04:38:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hoffman
 
04:38:31.250 --> 04:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative rung I think I saw
 
04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:33.299 align:start position:0%
something being handed out from you or
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
about to
 
04:38:35.039 --> 04:38:36.109 align:start position:0%
about to
yeah

04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
um just for the record I'm Rosemary rung
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
I represent Hillsboro 12 which is the
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
town of Merrimack I'm just passing out
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
the testimony I provided to the
 
04:38:46.970 --> 04:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
resources committee when this was
 
04:38:49.609 --> 04:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
introduced to the policy
 
04:38:49.619 --> 04:38:50.570 align:start position:0%
introduced to the policy
um

04:38:50.570 --> 04:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:54.789 --> 04:38:54.799 align:start position:0%
last year there was a bill passed
 
04:38:59.689 --> 04:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
HB 1066 which addresses the growing
 
04:39:02.209 --> 04:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
threat of cyanobacteria blooms in the
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms you may be aware
 
04:39:08.570 --> 04:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
growing problem globally and
 
04:39:10.369 --> 04:39:10.379 align:start position:0%
particularly in the last several years
 
04:39:14.269 --> 04:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
we've seen very disturbing trend of
 
04:39:15.789 --> 04:39:15.799 align:start position:0%
increased blooms in New Hampshire
 
04:39:20.330 --> 04:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
waterways primarily New Hampshire Lakes
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
um aside from the health and
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
environmental impact these blooms have
 
04:39:30.529 --> 04:39:30.539 align:start position:0%
um they they have a tremendous impact on
 
04:39:32.810 --> 04:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
our economy as well
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
um uh Pat tarpy who is executive
 
04:39:36.529 --> 04:39:36.539 align:start position:0%
director of Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
Association is behind me and she can
 
04:39:41.448 --> 04:39:41.458 align:start position:0%
speak to a specific economic study that
 
04:39:44.690 --> 04:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
was done and also Andrea lomino who is
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
the executive director of New Hampshire
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
lakes and they've been tracking this
 
04:39:50.090 --> 04:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
issue very closely for the last several
 
04:39:50.100 --> 04:39:50.890 align:start position:0%
issue very closely for the last several
years

04:39:50.890 --> 04:39:50.900 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
but I brought forth this bill because
 
04:39:53.878 --> 04:39:55.490 align:start position:0%
but I brought forth this bill because
the

04:39:55.490 --> 04:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
um in HP 1066 Des is charged with
 
04:40:01.850 --> 04:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
creating a plan to address and mitigate
 
04:40:04.368 --> 04:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms and that report is
 
04:40:07.730 --> 04:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
due in November but it is with certainty
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
that it's going to come with cost and so
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to introduce this bill to get
 
04:40:16.430 --> 04:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
a fund in place and I'm glad we've heard
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
about the pfas loan and Remediation fund
 
04:40:22.490 --> 04:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
and the drinking water and groundwater
 
04:40:25.730 --> 04:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
trust fund because I mirrored this bill
 
04:40:29.330 --> 04:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
after those funds which would provide
 
04:40:32.530 --> 04:40:32.540 align:start position:0%
loans and grants to municipalities
 
04:40:36.890 --> 04:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water Systems and water and
 
04:40:39.708 --> 04:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
Watershed and Lake Associations to
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
implement programs and projects to lower
 
04:40:47.470 --> 04:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
the contributors that lead to
 
04:40:50.448 --> 04:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
cyanobacterial blooms and probably the
 
04:40:53.170 --> 04:40:53.180 align:start position:0%
biggest contributor is phosphorus
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
phosphorus can come from failing septic
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
systems at the shoreline it could come
 
04:41:00.530 --> 04:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
from runoff
 
04:41:00.540 --> 04:41:01.448 align:start position:0%
from runoff
um

04:41:01.448 --> 04:41:01.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:05.570 --> 04:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh it could come from waste waterfowl
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
waste there's there's a lot of sources
 
04:41:07.920 --> 04:41:09.770 align:start position:0%
waste there's there's a lot of sources
for

04:41:09.770 --> 04:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:41:13.310 --> 04:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
um phosphorus loading into a lake and
 
04:41:16.208 --> 04:41:16.218 align:start position:0%
serving as a catalyst for these blooms
 
04:41:18.890 --> 04:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
and as we saw this year with Lake
 
04:41:21.050 --> 04:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee they essentially did not
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
have an ice in and so it is expected
 
04:41:26.750 --> 04:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
with that increased water temperature
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be a severe year
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
for blooms and if we can't Finance
 
04:41:34.670 --> 04:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
projects that are currently have already
 
04:41:37.310 --> 04:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
been identified to reduce the phosphorus
 
04:41:40.368 --> 04:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
it's just exacerb exacerbates the
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
problem in years to come because
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
phosphorus is an element it doesn't
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
break down if it's added to a lake it's
 
04:41:48.350 --> 04:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
going to contr can increase the
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
concentration of that phosphorus so the
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
sooner we can mitigate phosphorus being
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
added into a lake the less likely a
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
bloom is going to occur
 
04:41:59.160 --> 04:41:59.810 align:start position:0%
bloom is going to occur
um

04:41:59.810 --> 04:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:02.570 --> 04:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
what the way many of these Lake and
 
04:42:05.570 --> 04:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
Watershed associations have
 
04:42:08.810 --> 04:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
um funded mitigation projects is
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
essentially they do it on their own with
 
04:42:12.288 --> 04:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
limited funds they get a lot of
 
04:42:12.298 --> 04:42:14.208 align:start position:0%
limited funds they get a lot of
volunteers

04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
04:42:17.090 --> 04:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
um they pay for their own watershed
 
04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
management plans which are very
 
04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
professionally done studies of the of us
 
04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
of a water body that identify sources of
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and outline projects to
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
mitigate it
 
04:42:33.230 --> 04:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
they've been doing the the they've been
 
04:42:34.850 --> 04:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
funding the watershed management plans
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
essentially on their own there there's
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
some limited funds available but they
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
are very limited and pretty much don't
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
have access to funds to actually do the
 
04:42:47.810 --> 04:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
mitigation projects so this would be a
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
fund that could fund some of those
 
04:42:52.490 --> 04:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
projects right out of the gate and also
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
serve to fund the projects that come out
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
of that 1066 report that's due in
 
04:42:58.080 --> 04:43:00.288 align:start position:0%
of that 1066 report that's due in
November

04:43:00.288 --> 04:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
November
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
um I don't there there is some limited
 
04:43:04.368 --> 04:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
funding from the state and I'm sorry
 
04:43:06.530 --> 04:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott left but it's there's
 
04:43:08.090 --> 04:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
some federal funds that come into the
 
04:43:10.850 --> 04:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
state under it's called 319 funds
 
04:43:13.490 --> 04:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
they're extremely competitive
 
04:43:16.190 --> 04:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
um they don't fund a lot of quality
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
projects because it's very very limited
 
04:43:21.890 --> 04:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
um and every year the applications for
 
04:43:24.890 --> 04:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
those funds grows because this is a
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
excuse the pond but a blooming problem
 
04:43:27.120 --> 04:43:29.150 align:start position:0%
excuse the pond but a blooming problem
and

04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
um so I think having this Fund in place
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
to address cyanobacteria
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
um it is important to get this money in
 
04:43:38.810 --> 04:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
place because there's nothing we can do
 
04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to come with a price
 
04:43:43.490 --> 04:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
tag another important point I want to
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
raise is that I think at least 23
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state rely on
 
04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
surface water for their drinking water
 
04:43:56.030 --> 04:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
sources and they are really not prepared
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
to address blooms last year Arlington
 
04:44:01.730 --> 04:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
Pond which serves as a drinking water
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
source for the town of Salem experienced
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
a severe Bloom they were able to
 
04:44:09.610 --> 04:44:09.620 align:start position:0%
transfer their intake to Canopy Lake
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
there was a bloom at Bow Lake but I
 
04:44:15.288 --> 04:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
anticipate that what's going to come out
 
04:44:18.288 --> 04:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
of the November report is and I'm sure
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
that some water systems are considering
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
now is developing a plan B either trying
 
04:44:25.490 --> 04:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
to find groundwater sources but
 
04:44:28.850 --> 04:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
something they can use in the event a
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
bloom impacts their their intake
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
so I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire
 
04:44:40.610 --> 04:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:44:43.128 --> 04:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
representative when you develop this um
 
04:44:46.128 --> 04:44:46.138 align:start position:0%
plan did you consider
 
04:44:48.670 --> 04:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
maybe more of a punitive
 
04:44:52.010 --> 04:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
approach rather than the grant loan type
 
04:44:54.830 --> 04:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
thing in the sense of if people are
 
04:44:57.890 --> 04:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
putting phosphorus into the water then
 
04:45:00.530 --> 04:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
they get fined
 
04:45:03.948 --> 04:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question there was a
 
04:45:06.650 --> 04:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
bill a couple years ago that addressed
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
Shoreline septic systems and because
 
04:45:11.150 --> 04:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
many times these fail and people don't
 
04:45:12.890 --> 04:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
know because it's just going into the
 
04:45:15.410 --> 04:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
water and and historically phosphorus
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
has not been a problem in New Hampshire
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
but it's a variable that we can control
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
because we can't control the temperature
 
04:45:26.510 --> 04:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the lakes and rivers and those
 
04:45:28.610 --> 04:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
increasing temperatures even if we
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
didn't if phosphorus was the same we
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
would still be having Bloom so we have
 
04:45:37.610 --> 04:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
to reduce the phosphorus in the lake
 
04:45:39.170 --> 04:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
um punitive
 
04:45:41.448 --> 04:45:41.458 align:start position:0%
um I don't really know I I wish
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott had stayed because I
 
04:45:46.128 --> 04:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
I think the enforcement of current
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
regulations is an area that we should
 
04:45:50.510 --> 04:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
look at but
 
04:45:52.730 --> 04:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
um this this fund would also be used for
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
actual even in-link treatment systems
 
04:45:58.910 --> 04:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
for instance nippo Lake in Barrington
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
has had severe cyanobacteria blooms for
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
the past 10 years and their Lake
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
Association had worked very hard
 
04:46:08.570 --> 04:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
implementing projects to reduce
 
04:46:10.610 --> 04:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
phosphorus but it wasn't enough because
 
04:46:12.530 --> 04:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
there's another component called
 
04:46:15.788 --> 04:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
internal loading that can happen
 
04:46:18.530 --> 04:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go into all the science
 
04:46:20.150 --> 04:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to but I don't want to take
 
04:46:22.490 --> 04:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
up your time now now but the state
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
actually worked with nippo Lake getting
 
04:46:27.890 --> 04:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
funds to do what's called an Alum
 
04:46:31.128 --> 04:46:31.138 align:start position:0%
treatment and they spray Alum on and it
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
settles and it locks in the internal
 
04:46:36.770 --> 04:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
loading source of phosphorus that that's
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the sediment and it's been very
 
04:46:41.690 --> 04:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
successful they did one years ago on
 
04:46:45.770 --> 04:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
Kaiser Lake which was actually an um a
 
04:46:47.390 --> 04:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
source where effluent Wastewater
 
04:46:49.128 --> 04:46:49.138 align:start position:0%
effluent it used to go into that Lake
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it's severe problems so those
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
treatments run up to a half a million
 
04:46:56.090 --> 04:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
dollars and there may be some water
 
04:46:58.368 --> 04:46:58.378 align:start position:0%
bodies that are so impaired that they
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
may need an in-link treatment and this
 
04:47:04.128 --> 04:47:04.138 align:start position:0%
would would cover that as well I know
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
Silver Lake and Hollis is essentially
 
04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's a state park and I don't really
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
know if it's been open much in the past
 
04:47:14.170 --> 04:47:14.180 align:start position:0%
few years between E coli
 
04:47:17.090 --> 04:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
contamination and cyanobacteria blooms
 
04:47:21.288 --> 04:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
that's likely going to be a that that
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
would probably qualify for in-link
 
04:47:25.010 --> 04:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
treatment and at the moment
 
04:47:28.610 --> 04:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Lake Associations and
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
Watershed associations just don't have
 
04:47:33.288 --> 04:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
access to the capital needed to fund
 
04:47:36.010 --> 04:47:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.288 --> 04:47:39.298 align:start position:0%
so are you thinking of this money as
 
04:47:43.208 --> 04:47:43.218 align:start position:0%
being some loans to to improve septic
 
04:47:48.170 --> 04:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
systems and some grants to do this these
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
treatments of lakes is that kind of
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
initially before this bill was amended
 
04:47:56.330 --> 04:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
it was purely a Loan Fund and I modeled
 
04:47:58.010 --> 04:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
it after
 
04:48:00.708 --> 04:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
um the pfas mitigation Loan Fund but
 
04:48:03.410 --> 04:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
what came out in the the Committee
 
04:48:06.350 --> 04:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
hearing was that and and this was a
 
04:48:08.690 --> 04:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
concern commissioner Scott raised is
 
04:48:11.090 --> 04:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
that there is some associations that can
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
Implement projects but they wouldn't
 
04:48:17.390 --> 04:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
qualify for a loan so my intent would be
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
that small associations that have
 
04:48:22.610 --> 04:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
identified projects from an EPA approved
 
04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
watershed management plan could access a
 
04:48:26.690 --> 04:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
grant component of this but
 
04:48:28.970 --> 04:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Municipal Water
 
04:48:31.310 --> 04:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
Systems could get a grant similar to
 
04:48:32.590 --> 04:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
what we heard
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the pfas fund so it would be a
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
hybrid of a grant Loan program depending
 
04:48:41.090 --> 04:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
on the organization that would be
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
applying and also the ranking of the
 
04:48:44.040 --> 04:48:45.070 align:start position:0%
applying and also the ranking of the
project

04:48:45.070 --> 04:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:48:48.708 --> 04:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
if there are you know water bodies in
 
04:48:50.750 --> 04:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have some have been
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
identified as being impaired and some at
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
risk and so for instance if there's a a
 
04:49:00.190 --> 04:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
lake that is
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
strategic to the economy of New
 
04:49:05.330 --> 04:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
um they they might qualify like
 
04:49:10.368 --> 04:49:10.378 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee Association may qualify
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
for a grant to let's say do mitigation
 
04:49:13.680 --> 04:49:14.770 align:start position:0%
for a grant to let's say do mitigation
around

04:49:14.770 --> 04:49:14.780 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:49:17.390 --> 04:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
State Park which suffered I think two or
 
04:49:18.890 --> 04:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
three blooms last summer they were
 
04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
closed so um
 
04:49:25.128 --> 04:49:25.138 align:start position:0%
and but it can also be used in um to
 
04:49:27.170 --> 04:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
support education and communication
 
04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
because many people that are impacted by
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms are on private
 
04:49:35.570 --> 04:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
property their Waterfront we don't how
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
do they know
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
um I know in my experience there have
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
been people who've been renting
 
04:49:43.250 --> 04:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
waterfront property spending thousands
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
of dollars to spend a week Lakeside and
 
04:49:48.410 --> 04:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
find out they can't go in the water that
 
04:49:51.170 --> 04:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
they're you know that it's hazardous I
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
have known people who who a dog died
 
04:49:55.368 --> 04:49:55.378 align:start position:0%
from going in the water
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
um so we have the immediate economic
 
04:50:00.350 --> 04:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
issues but they're also long-term Health
 
04:50:00.360 --> 04:50:02.090 align:start position:0%
issues but they're also long-term Health
impacts

04:50:02.090 --> 04:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and some of the diseases that are
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
linked to exposures to cyanotoxins are
 
04:50:13.550 --> 04:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
very they're very horrible diseases and
 
04:50:16.090 --> 04:50:16.100 align:start position:0%
very expensive ALS
 
04:50:19.490 --> 04:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's Parkinson's disease are have
 
04:50:22.250 --> 04:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
all been linked to cyanotoxin and there
 
04:50:25.368 --> 04:50:25.378 align:start position:0%
have been very good studies showing that
 
04:50:27.470 --> 04:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
connection in fact a professor at
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Dr Elijah stommel's been a
 
04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:33.480 --> 04:50:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
today

04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:50:37.368 --> 04:50:37.378 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
I do have a couple myself and and I do
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
want to rely I mean
 
04:50:44.330 --> 04:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
um Pat tarpey and Andrea Lamar could
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
probably give a lot of specific
 
04:50:48.530 --> 04:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
information about the economic
 
04:50:51.410 --> 04:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
um the economy that's at risk if we
 
04:50:54.410 --> 04:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
don't mitigate cyanobacteria blooms
 
04:50:56.570 --> 04:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
well just an observation about Silver
 
04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
Lake and Hollis it wasn't safe to swim
 
04:51:02.288 --> 04:51:02.298 align:start position:0%
in 40 years ago when I was a kid so but
 
04:51:06.250 --> 04:51:06.260 align:start position:0%
anyway in looking at the fiscal note
 
04:51:09.288 --> 04:51:09.298 align:start position:0%
Des is a management plan would have had
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
to be submitted do you know are there
 
04:51:13.550 --> 04:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
any management plans that anyone has
 
04:51:16.250 --> 04:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
submitted for funds that may be
 
04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
available or
 
04:51:20.690 --> 04:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
um they're very limited federal funds
 
04:51:22.490 --> 04:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's extremely competitive it doesn't
 
04:51:25.490 --> 04:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
fund eligible programs I think the the
 
04:51:28.970 --> 04:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
watershed management plans many many
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
like dozens of lakes in New Hampshire
 
04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
have and rivers have submitted uh
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
watershed management plans that have
 
04:51:37.570 --> 04:51:37.580 align:start position:0%
identified projects
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
some of these projects have been
 
04:51:41.448 --> 04:51:41.458 align:start position:0%
submitted to the state for funding and
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
some have been successful and some have
 
04:51:44.510 --> 04:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
not because the funding the state
 
04:51:46.550 --> 04:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
provides really gets channeled in from
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
those 319 federal funds and I believe
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
um last year it was about 450 to 500
 
04:51:55.200 --> 04:51:56.270 align:start position:0%
um last year it was about 450 to 500
000.

04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
000.
 
04:51:59.150 --> 04:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
but some of these projects may involve
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
building new culverts on private roads
 
04:52:03.890 --> 04:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
because that's the other thing a lot of
 
04:52:05.930 --> 04:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
these the runoff is coming from private
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
roads that are run the around these
 
04:52:10.190 --> 04:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
water bodies and there aren't any
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
essentially standards for managing that
 
04:52:16.490 --> 04:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
that runoff so some of these projects
 
04:52:19.448 --> 04:52:19.458 align:start position:0%
the projects I've seen are actually
 
04:52:21.890 --> 04:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
re-engineering these roads so that the
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
runoff can be captured and not go
 
04:52:25.610 --> 04:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
directly into the lake it could be
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
naturally treated before it it goes into
 
04:52:31.250 --> 04:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
that watershed
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
now the Department of Environmental
 
04:52:34.730 --> 04:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
Services has said that they'll have to
 
04:52:37.490 --> 04:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
develop rules to administer this whole
 
04:52:40.730 --> 04:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
process which often takes six months to
 
04:52:43.610 --> 04:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
a year and then they're also pointing
 
04:52:45.770 --> 04:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
out they need at least three people to
 
04:52:49.310 --> 04:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
oversee this program
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
in your
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
requesting about 25 million dollars in
 
04:52:57.650 --> 04:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
the next year so is that something where
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
did that 25 million dollars come from I
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
guess because you've got a number of
 
04:53:03.650 --> 04:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
moving Parts your administrative rules
 
04:53:05.470 --> 04:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
hiring staff
 
04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
plans that have to be submitted to the
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
department as far as Watershed plans
 
04:53:15.650 --> 04:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
I I really based it off of uh modeling
 
04:53:18.170 --> 04:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
the when the pfas fund got established
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
and also looking at the um the the 319
 
04:53:27.530 --> 04:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh funding that's done for a lot of
 
04:53:29.510 --> 04:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
these projects now and that half a
 
04:53:31.368 --> 04:53:31.378 align:start position:0%
million is not sufficient to cover
 
04:53:34.550 --> 04:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
everything so it's
 
04:53:36.050 --> 04:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say it was just a number
 
04:53:38.208 --> 04:53:38.218 align:start position:0%
that pulled off but it was kind of I
 
04:53:40.010 --> 04:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
looked at some guidelines of what we
 
04:53:42.530 --> 04:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
what's worked already in the state and
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
how how projects like this to address
 
04:53:47.448 --> 04:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
environmental issues have been funded
 
04:53:49.610 --> 04:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
and that's where I got that 25 million
 
04:53:52.550 --> 04:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
so here's one other question from me for
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
the projects that have gone on so far in
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
the state to address these plumes you
 
04:53:59.448 --> 04:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
know how much money has been spent like
 
04:54:01.250 --> 04:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
how much money a year whether it's
 
04:54:04.010 --> 04:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
private funds or federal funds or
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
Association funds has been put towards
 
04:54:08.628 --> 04:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
trying to control these
 
04:54:11.090 --> 04:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:54:12.770 --> 04:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative I I think I'd like to
 
04:54:15.050 --> 04:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
defer to miss Harvey on that she would
 
04:54:17.448 --> 04:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
have specific examples and maybe Miss
 
04:54:19.550 --> 04:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
Loma wrote to
 
04:54:22.490 --> 04:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
um because their their look they this is
 
04:54:25.368 --> 04:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
what they deal with every day so
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
um Lake issues
 
04:54:28.490 --> 04:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so if you don't mind I'd rather I
 
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
think they could give you more accurate
 
04:54:29.940 --> 04:54:31.430 align:start position:0%
think they could give you more accurate
information

04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:54:33.530 --> 04:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
um because Mine mine's very limited I
 
04:54:35.330 --> 04:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
don't have a full scope of all the
 
04:54:37.970 --> 04:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
private and public funded projects uh
 
04:54:39.770 --> 04:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
before you leave any other questions for
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
the representative for Merrimack seeing
 
04:54:44.570 --> 04:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
none thank you okay thank you oh and one
 
04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
more if you don't mind I'd like to just
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
add one more thing far about people
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
being hired to administer this right now
 
04:54:54.288 --> 04:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
there's only one person in the entire
 
04:54:56.810 --> 04:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
State that's assigned to the site the
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
it's called harmful algal program
 
04:55:00.718 --> 04:55:02.090 align:start position:0%
it's called harmful algal program
um and

04:55:02.090 --> 04:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
um and then she reports to the water
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
biologist for the state Mr Neal so
 
04:55:09.708 --> 04:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
um there we're adding staff where
 
04:55:12.650 --> 04:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
there's just really one person now so
 
04:55:13.730 --> 04:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:17.690 --> 04:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:20.570 --> 04:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
so whomever would like to come up the
 
04:55:25.610 --> 04:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:27.708 --> 04:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
and if you could state your name for the
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh t-a-r-p-e-y
 
04:55:40.368 --> 04:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
president of the Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:55:40.378 --> 04:55:41.930 align:start position:0%
president of the Lake Winnipesaukee
Association

04:55:41.930 --> 04:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
Association
 
04:55:44.810 --> 04:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
so our organization is a 501c3
 
04:55:44.820 --> 04:55:46.430 align:start position:0%
so our organization is a 501c3
non-profit

04:55:46.430 --> 04:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
04:55:48.410 --> 04:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
um we've you know our mission is to
 
04:55:49.788 --> 04:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
protect the water quality and natural
 
04:55:52.730 --> 04:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
resources of the lake and the Watershed
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the past 12 years
 
04:55:56.810 --> 04:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
um since I've been in this position
 
04:55:59.390 --> 04:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
we've been conducting water and
 
04:56:01.730 --> 04:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
Watershed studies on Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:56:04.610 --> 04:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
and because it's so large we do it on
 
04:56:06.890 --> 04:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
what we call a sub Watershed level so
 
04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
we've completed six of these watershed
 
04:56:11.810 --> 04:56:11.820 align:start position:0%
management plans for the lake we have
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
four left to do
 
04:56:16.930 --> 04:56:16.940 align:start position:0%
um and with those Watershed studies
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
we've received 319 money to do those
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
studies 319 money is not available for
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
planning anymore it's only for
 
04:56:28.490 --> 04:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
implementation which is what um
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
319 is through EPA Clean Water Act and
 
04:56:34.610 --> 04:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's administered by the New Hampshire
 
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
04:56:40.850 --> 04:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
as rep representative wrong said for
 
04:56:43.368 --> 04:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
implementation or restoration there's
 
04:56:45.650 --> 04:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
only about 500 000 a year available
 
04:56:49.730 --> 04:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.530 --> 04:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
um it is very competitive our
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
organization has been very successful in
 
04:56:56.708 --> 04:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
getting those grants we've probably
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
received about 500
 
04:57:02.930 --> 04:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
000 for for restoration work and we've
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
received another 500 000 for Action The
 
04:57:07.070 --> 04:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
Watershed planning work that was done
 
04:57:07.080 --> 04:57:08.690 align:start position:0%
Watershed planning work that was done
first

04:57:08.690 --> 04:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
um so with the amount of plans we've
 
04:57:15.070 --> 04:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
completed to date we've identified over
 
04:57:18.770 --> 04:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
270 sites in need of mitigation at a
 
04:57:20.570 --> 04:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
cost of roughly four million dollars
 
04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
which is very conservative it actually
 
04:57:25.970 --> 04:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover labor and equipment for
 
04:57:28.368 --> 04:57:28.378 align:start position:0%
this mitigation our consultants and
 
04:57:31.208 --> 04:57:31.218 align:start position:0%
Engineers base it on
 
04:57:33.948 --> 04:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
materials and stuff like that and
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
usually we have to hire an engineer to
 
04:57:39.890 --> 04:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
come in and give us a real cost number
 
04:57:39.900 --> 04:57:41.270 align:start position:0%
come in and give us a real cost number
so

04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:43.368 --> 04:57:43.378 align:start position:0%
um representative wrong mentioned the
 
04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
economic importance of Lake
 
04:57:48.890 --> 04:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee in 2021 we had a policy
 
04:57:51.288 --> 04:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
brief issued by the Nelson Rockefeller
 
04:57:53.930 --> 04:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
Center for Public Policy and social
 
04:57:56.810 --> 04:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
sciences out of Dartmouth College to
 
04:57:58.490 --> 04:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
estimate the value Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
brings to Lakes Region and New Hampshire
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
and it came in at a little over 17
 
04:58:05.390 --> 04:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
billion dollars which was kind of an
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
eye-opener for us but um 16 billion of
 
04:58:10.970 --> 04:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
that is in property values alone around
 
04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
the lake another 445 million comes from
 
04:58:17.330 --> 04:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
revenue from tourism boating fishing and
 
04:58:19.628 --> 04:58:19.638 align:start position:0%
summer camps
 
04:58:22.850 --> 04:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
and that 445 million really only
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
probably represents a fraction of the
 
04:58:29.090 --> 04:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
two true recreational value the 16
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
billion in property values brings in
 
04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
over 200 million in tax revenue for
 
04:58:35.708 --> 04:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
those shortfront communities
 
04:58:37.970 --> 04:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
they've definitely recognized the
 
04:58:40.010 --> 04:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
importance of Lake Winnipesaukee for
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
them it's their Golden Goose and they're
 
04:58:44.288 --> 04:58:44.298 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
committed I would say almost entirely
 
04:58:49.368 --> 04:58:49.378 align:start position:0%
Lake wide to protecting that Lake and
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
investing money
 
04:58:54.170 --> 04:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
so when I said we had 500 000 in grant
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
money that's been matched with another
 
04:58:59.330 --> 04:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
500 000 from the towns so they're
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're putting money back in for these
 
04:59:01.440 --> 04:59:03.170 align:start position:0%
they're putting money back in for these
projects

04:59:03.170 --> 04:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:59:03.180 --> 04:59:03.890 align:start position:0%
projects
um

04:59:03.890 --> 04:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:07.010 --> 04:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
in the last five years we have seen an
 
04:59:09.590 --> 04:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
increase in cyanobacteria
 
04:59:12.830 --> 04:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
occurrences and I have to say honestly I
 
04:59:14.208 --> 04:59:14.218 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's because it's more
 
04:59:16.610 --> 04:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
awareness and so people are reporting it
 
04:59:19.850 --> 04:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
more but we know in 2018 there was only
 
04:59:22.730 --> 04:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
one advisory issued and last summer
 
04:59:25.850 --> 04:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
there were 18 observations three alerts
 
04:59:27.890 --> 04:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
and four advisories
 
04:59:30.530 --> 04:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
so it's it's increased quite a bit and
 
04:59:32.270 --> 04:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
maybe it's all with our knowledge and
 
04:59:33.550 --> 04:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
awareness of it
 
04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
we do know that the lake from the water
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
and Watershed studies that our
 
04:59:41.030 --> 04:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
organization has conducted we know that
 
04:59:43.970 --> 04:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
the stormwater runoff the amount of
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
nutrient loading coming into the lake is
 
04:59:49.128 --> 04:59:49.138 align:start position:0%
300 percent higher than natural
 
04:59:51.170 --> 04:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
background levels so it's all from
 
04:59:53.288 --> 04:59:53.298 align:start position:0%
development and that is you know
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
polluted stormwater runoff accounts for
 
04:59:58.930 --> 04:59:58.940 align:start position:0%
85 to 90 of our pollution problems
 
05:00:01.730 --> 05:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
you can look to our neighboring state
 
05:00:03.650 --> 05:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Lake Champlain what's been
 
05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
going on there
 
05:00:05.120 --> 05:00:06.830 align:start position:0%
going on there
they

05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
um right now they have property values
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
have declined by over 15 percent on
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
Shore front properties they are under
 
05:00:16.430 --> 05:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
EPA mandate right now to clean up the
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
lake due to cyanobacteria at an
 
05:00:20.570 --> 05:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
estimated cost of about one billion
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
dollars and they're looking at a time
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
frame of 20 years to do that so 50
 
05:00:27.770 --> 05:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
million a year and they're wondering
 
05:00:29.628 --> 05:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
where that money is coming from
 
05:00:32.930 --> 05:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
so restoration is expensive
 
05:00:34.850 --> 05:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
um like I said we've identified we
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
haven't even come close to identifying
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
all the potential projects and we know
 
05:00:41.948 --> 05:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
we have a conservative 4 million needed
 
05:00:46.250 --> 05:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
so the 25 million I think is a pretty
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
good start
 
05:00:48.360 --> 05:00:49.010 align:start position:0%
good start
um

05:00:49.010 --> 05:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're one of many organizations
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
competing for the limited Federal monies
 
05:00:55.970 --> 05:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
we do partner with the municipalities
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
for local cash match and in-kind and
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
they've been very good about providing
 
05:01:03.170 --> 05:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
that this loan or grant program would
 
05:01:05.288 --> 05:01:05.298 align:start position:0%
desperately provide some needed funding
 
05:01:08.810 --> 05:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
Statewide and to Pro you know protect
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
our valuable water resources and the
 
05:01:13.610 --> 05:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
economic importance that our Lakes bring
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
so that's what I have would you accept
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
any questions sure representative
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman if this
 
05:01:24.050 --> 05:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
money were loaned to you 4 million do
 
05:01:26.350 --> 05:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
you have the ability to pay it back and
 
05:01:29.150 --> 05:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
what's your source of income
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
so as a non-profit yeah we're not
 
05:01:34.788 --> 05:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
looking for loans but the municipalities
 
05:01:37.690 --> 05:01:37.700 align:start position:0%
that we work with might take that route
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
we rely on grants membership donations
 
05:01:44.208 --> 05:01:44.218 align:start position:0%
that's where we get our funding right
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
now I'm working with the town of
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
wolfborough who applied for a loan
 
05:01:49.788 --> 05:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
through the Clean Water State revolving
 
05:01:51.890 --> 05:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
fund to do a management plan for
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro Bay and it was a hundred
 
05:01:56.208 --> 05:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar loan they were willing
 
05:01:58.610 --> 05:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
to do that and it got converted to a
 
05:02:01.610 --> 05:02:01.620 align:start position:0%
grant so right now what's what's your
 
05:02:01.620 --> 05:02:02.628 align:start position:0%
grant so right now what's what's your
general

05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:02:02.638 --> 05:02:03.230 align:start position:0%
general
um

05:02:03.230 --> 05:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:07.010 --> 05:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
annual revenue or annual expenditures
 
05:02:08.330 --> 05:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
um right now I've been working on our
 
05:02:10.730 --> 05:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
budget so four hundred thousand but
 
05:02:12.650 --> 05:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's not covering all matching
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.250 --> 05:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you thank
 
05:02:21.050 --> 05:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
you for coming
 
05:02:21.060 --> 05:02:21.650 align:start position:0%
you for coming
um

05:02:21.650 --> 05:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:24.250 --> 05:02:24.260 align:start position:0%
what's your impression of the land use
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
regulations around the lake and how they
 
05:02:29.690 --> 05:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
affect what's going on I mean are there
 
05:02:32.448 --> 05:02:32.458 align:start position:0%
Shoreland setbacks there I know there's
 
05:02:34.368 --> 05:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
been incredible amount of development
 
05:02:36.350 --> 05:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
has that been
 
05:02:39.288 --> 05:02:39.298 align:start position:0%
must be contributing to the problem I
 
05:02:41.570 --> 05:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
just wondered how much effort has been
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
put into land use right so you know
 
05:02:47.330 --> 05:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee and I'm sure a lot of
 
05:02:50.270 --> 05:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire
 
05:02:50.280 --> 05:02:51.288 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire
um

05:02:51.288 --> 05:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:53.930 --> 05:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's a different animal sometimes I say
 
05:02:57.170 --> 05:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
you know you have different levels of
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
technical financial resources available
 
05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
based on community you can have a
 
05:03:04.730 --> 05:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
community that has uh Center Harbor does
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
not have a professional planner
 
05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
but you know Noah does tuft and borrow
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
but Wolfeboro Alton Guilford Laconia
 
05:03:15.430 --> 05:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
they do so they have planning staff
 
05:03:18.850 --> 05:03:18.860 align:start position:0%
others don't we don't have uniform
 
05:03:21.948 --> 05:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
setbacks by community so we're looking
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
at a watershed Focus but every Community
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
has different zoning and ordinances for
 
05:03:32.690 --> 05:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
land use it's something our organization
 
05:03:34.670 --> 05:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
is looks at in these watershed
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
management plans we look at what's on
 
05:03:38.990 --> 05:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
the books now and how we can work with
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
communities to improve those regulations
 
05:03:43.690 --> 05:03:43.700 align:start position:0%
they already have
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
but the other issue is enforcement it's
 
05:03:52.970 --> 05:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
on the mitigation sites you've
 
05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
identified are those private properties
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
or are they Municipal there it's all
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's all public because when we do these
 
05:04:04.490 --> 05:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
plans we cannot go on private property
 
05:04:04.500 --> 05:04:07.430 align:start position:0%
plans we cannot go on private property
yep

05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up to representative
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
Evil's question I've spent time up there
 
05:04:15.530 --> 05:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
in Winnipesaukee and win a Squam and
 
05:04:17.570 --> 05:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
Squam and over the years has been
 
05:04:19.128 --> 05:04:19.138 align:start position:0%
greater as she mentioned development
 
05:04:21.050 --> 05:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
people cut the trees right down the
 
05:04:23.570 --> 05:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
water level they've got beautiful Lawns
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
right to the water level which they are
 
05:04:27.770 --> 05:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
fertilizing adding to nitrogen and
 
05:04:30.110 --> 05:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
phosphorus in the water so what's being
 
05:04:32.270 --> 05:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
done to try to address this before it
 
05:04:34.670 --> 05:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem like do you have a
 
05:04:36.170 --> 05:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
group that goes around and meets with
 
05:04:39.170 --> 05:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
landowners or do you put out information
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
so people know they should have a
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
generally a better setback instead of
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
going right to the water's edge or yes
 
05:04:47.530 --> 05:04:47.540 align:start position:0%
we do
 
05:04:51.650 --> 05:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
we try and working out not not great
 
05:04:51.660 --> 05:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
we try and working out not not great
um

05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:55.368 --> 05:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
we try and work with landscapers to
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
educate them last summer we started a
 
05:05:00.890 --> 05:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
program working with all the local
 
05:05:03.288 --> 05:05:03.298 align:start position:0%
hardware stores about not caring
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
phosphorus containing fertilizer
 
05:05:06.480 --> 05:05:07.430 align:start position:0%
phosphorus containing fertilizer
um

05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:09.770 --> 05:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
you know the shorefront protection act
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
is supposed to restrict that type of
 
05:05:14.990 --> 05:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
activity but it happens all the time
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
there are violations and we are actually
 
05:05:20.270 --> 05:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
have partnered with New Hampshire Lakes
 
05:05:23.208 --> 05:05:23.218 align:start position:0%
which Andrea behind me can speak to on
 
05:05:26.330 --> 05:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
the their Lake smart program which is to
 
05:05:28.010 --> 05:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
work with individual residential
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
property owners on what they can do on
 
05:05:36.410 --> 05:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:44.510 --> 05:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:56.810 --> 05:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Andrea lamoreaux from
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes I can spell my last
 
05:06:03.770 --> 05:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
name uh L-A capital m o r e a u x
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm the president of New Hampshire
 
05:06:05.280 --> 05:06:06.470 align:start position:0%
so I'm the president of New Hampshire
Lakes

05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
um and uh representative wrong in patch
 
05:06:11.208 --> 05:06:11.218 align:start position:0%
harpy from lwa have already done a great
 
05:06:11.218 --> 05:06:12.250 align:start position:0%
harpy from lwa have already done a great
job

05:06:12.250 --> 05:06:12.260 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:06:14.810 --> 05:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
explaining the problem explaining the
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
proposed solution and so I just wanted
 
05:06:19.730 --> 05:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
to take just a few minutes to just
 
05:06:21.650 --> 05:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit more data and
 
05:06:26.410 --> 05:06:26.420 align:start position:0%
another example of a watershed group so
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
we are supporting this bill and urge you
 
05:06:31.330 --> 05:06:31.340 align:start position:0%
to support it as you've heard
 
05:06:34.010 --> 05:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in
 
05:06:36.788 --> 05:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in frequency and duration
 
05:06:40.430 --> 05:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
and just a little bit of data 2022 was
 
05:06:42.890 --> 05:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a record-breaking year for
 
05:06:45.410 --> 05:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
toxic blooms in our Lakes the Department
 
05:06:48.230 --> 05:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services issued 46
 
05:06:51.850 --> 05:06:51.860 align:start position:0%
advisories on 36
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers so it's not just a lake
 
05:06:56.930 --> 05:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
problem anymore we're seeing this in our
 
05:06:56.940 --> 05:06:58.670 align:start position:0%
problem anymore we're seeing this in our
Rivers

05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
Rivers
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
um these advisories accounted for 77
 
05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
days at our state park freshwater
 
05:07:06.650 --> 05:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
beaches where people were basically told
 
05:07:08.330 --> 05:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
to stay out of the water at our state
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
parks so our citizens and our visitors
 
05:07:12.530 --> 05:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
were you know told not to go in the
 
05:07:12.540 --> 05:07:13.930 align:start position:0%
were you know told not to go in the
water

05:07:13.930 --> 05:07:13.940 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:07:17.208 --> 05:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
Statewide our lakes ponds and rivers
 
05:07:19.610 --> 05:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
last summer were under advisories for a
 
05:07:22.490 --> 05:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
total of 829 days
 
05:07:26.208 --> 05:07:26.218 align:start position:0%
so that's a bummer if the lake
 
05:07:27.890 --> 05:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
um you know your the water body that
 
05:07:29.448 --> 05:07:29.458 align:start position:0%
you're you live along or that you're
 
05:07:31.610 --> 05:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
visiting for the summer is you're told
 
05:07:33.890 --> 05:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
to stay out of the water the average
 
05:07:36.590 --> 05:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
length of a bloom last summer was 25
 
05:07:40.368 --> 05:07:40.378 align:start position:0%
days the longest Bloom was 103 days so
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
14 weeks essentially the whole summer so
 
05:07:44.090 --> 05:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
just you know adding to what you've
 
05:07:46.610 --> 05:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
already heard this is a severe problem a
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
growing problem a recreational problem
 
05:07:51.530 --> 05:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
an economic problem
 
05:07:53.628 --> 05:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to give you a little
 
05:07:55.970 --> 05:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
bit more information about the grant
 
05:07:58.550 --> 05:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
funding that is available currently and
 
05:07:59.930 --> 05:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
Pat and her team at the Lake
 
05:08:02.090 --> 05:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee Association have done a
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
tremendous job over the years securing
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
local funding Partnerships and federal
 
05:08:11.208 --> 05:08:11.218 align:start position:0%
funding through that 319 program to do
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
really an amazing amount of work along
 
05:08:16.490 --> 05:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
around Winnipesaukee
 
05:08:18.770 --> 05:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just show another example of
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
a Lake Association Tucker pond in
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
Salisbury New Hampshire
 
05:08:24.770 --> 05:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
um small pot has anyone ever been there
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of small Out of the Woods out
 
05:08:30.650 --> 05:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
in the woods water body but in 2020
 
05:08:33.050 --> 05:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
Summer of 2020 it started blooming with
 
05:08:35.150 --> 05:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
a toxic Bloom and it bloomed all summer
 
05:08:37.610 --> 05:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
and into the fall so basically that
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
whole summer people couldn't use the
 
05:08:42.708 --> 05:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
lake the next two years it also bloomed
 
05:08:42.718 --> 05:08:44.208 align:start position:0%
lake the next two years it also bloomed
similarly

05:08:44.208 --> 05:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so the residents around that Lake
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
got together formed a volunteer
 
05:08:50.570 --> 05:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria advisory committee they
 
05:08:52.610 --> 05:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
did fundraisers they got Municipal
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
support and funding they hired a
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
consultant and developed a state
 
05:09:01.250 --> 05:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
approved watershed management plan
 
05:09:03.708 --> 05:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
so now that they had this plan a lot of
 
05:09:06.530 --> 05:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
Blood Sweat and Tears they then applied
 
05:09:09.410 --> 05:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
to Des for the 319 grant program last
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
fall and while they were told
 
05:09:15.770 --> 05:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
they had an excellent proposal they did
 
05:09:19.250 --> 05:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
not re make the cut for being funded the
 
05:09:21.050 --> 05:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
funding they didn't have enough funding
 
05:09:23.570 --> 05:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
funding to go low enough and just to get
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
and give you an idea about what that
 
05:09:27.128 --> 05:09:27.138 align:start position:0%
group was proposing they were proposing
 
05:09:30.410 --> 05:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
basically a 10-year action plan that
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
would cost in today's dollars about 750
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
000 to address the primary contributors
 
05:09:39.708 --> 05:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
to pollution to the pond to these
 
05:09:41.810 --> 05:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
causing these blooms
 
05:09:46.190 --> 05:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
so there is definitely a need to get
 
05:09:48.890 --> 05:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
more funding into the hands of groups
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
who know where the problems are more
 
05:09:51.000 --> 05:09:51.948 align:start position:0%
who know where the problems are more
quickly

05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can try to stop these blooms
 
05:09:56.690 --> 05:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
before we see you know property values
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
severely plummet more people decide not
 
05:10:01.070 --> 05:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
to vacation in New Hampshire you know
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
more businesses losing out on money you
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
know not being able to have run their
 
05:10:07.070 --> 05:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
Beach or rent out their boats
 
05:10:09.948 --> 05:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
so I just added a little more data there
 
05:10:13.490 --> 05:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.810 --> 05:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
are there any questions yes
 
05:10:16.610 --> 05:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here so you
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned stopping the major sources of
 
05:10:22.550 --> 05:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
pollution to the pond in the case of the
 
05:10:24.530 --> 05:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
Tucker pond in Salisbury what were the
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
sources of pollution thank you for the
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
question great question
 
05:10:29.570 --> 05:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
um so the sources to their management
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
plan that they did with their consultant
 
05:10:33.650 --> 05:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
determined a number of things in a
 
05:10:36.410 --> 05:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
private septic systems but also a lot of
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
roadway issues Culvert issues runoff
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
issues that the town will hopefully be
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
able to help be a partner in to help
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
correct but it was a lot of septic and
 
05:10:49.430 --> 05:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
roadway issues there
 
05:10:52.970 --> 05:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up So when you say roadways the
 
05:10:54.410 --> 05:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
construction of the roadway or is it the
 
05:10:56.930 --> 05:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
salting the construction basically you
 
05:10:58.550 --> 05:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
know when we laid out all of our roads
 
05:11:00.288 --> 05:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
however when we didn't know it wasn't a
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
good idea to put them right around the
 
05:11:04.128 --> 05:11:04.138 align:start position:0%
lake and we didn't know better to like
 
05:11:06.410 --> 05:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
not divert them you know so now it's
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
reconstructing those roadways we can't
 
05:11:10.368 --> 05:11:10.378 align:start position:0%
really move them away from the lake but
 
05:11:12.650 --> 05:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
you know regrading them re-tilting you
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
know putting more drainage around them
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
so that water can soak into the ground
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
and not you know wash off the all the
 
05:11:21.708 --> 05:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
soil on someone's property and into the
 
05:11:23.330 --> 05:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
lake thank you
 
05:11:26.090 --> 05:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:27.948 --> 05:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
05:11:27.958 --> 05:11:29.690 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative

05:11:29.690 --> 05:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
evil
 
05:11:32.810 --> 05:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
what's your sense of the health of
 
05:11:36.350 --> 05:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
septic systems around our Lakes
 
05:11:38.330 --> 05:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
because they're big contributors I
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
assume yes
 
05:11:43.070 --> 05:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
um my pers my opinion our opinion New
 
05:11:45.910 --> 05:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes's opinion is that
 
05:11:48.830 --> 05:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
the health of private septic systems
 
05:11:50.990 --> 05:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
around our Lakes is not good actually
 
05:11:52.970 --> 05:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
the reason I know this is Pat referred
 
05:11:55.368 --> 05:11:55.378 align:start position:0%
to is that we run a lake friendly Lake
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
smart Lake friendly Living Program we've
 
05:12:00.590 --> 05:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
met with nearly 500 Property Owners at
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
130 water bodies over the past three or
 
05:12:05.090 --> 05:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
four years and we go to their house free
 
05:12:07.730 --> 05:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
service and talk to them how about how
 
05:12:09.890 --> 05:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
they can become more like friendly and
 
05:12:11.330 --> 05:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
if they're like friendly we give them an
 
05:12:13.550 --> 05:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
award and say hey you're like smart we
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
try to start this this
 
05:12:15.600 --> 05:12:16.368 align:start position:0%
try to start this this
um

05:12:16.368 --> 05:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:19.010 --> 05:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
sort of Norm or Tradition at Lakes for
 
05:12:20.410 --> 05:12:20.420 align:start position:0%
people to live in a lake-friendly way
 
05:12:23.868 --> 05:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
more often than not we are unable to
 
05:12:26.570 --> 05:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
give someone a like smart award because
 
05:12:30.050 --> 05:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
they have a septic system that's
 
05:12:31.610 --> 05:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
um hasn't been inspected or they don't
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
know where it is or it's just old and
 
05:12:35.330 --> 05:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
needs to be upgraded
 
05:12:38.690 --> 05:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
and so when I testified earlier to the r
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
d committee you know one of my
 
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
suggestions is this may be this Loan
 
05:12:46.030 --> 05:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
Fund could possibly be something to help
 
05:12:48.890 --> 05:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
Property Owners upgrade their septic
 
05:12:50.448 --> 05:12:50.458 align:start position:0%
systems you know we meet a lot of
 
05:12:53.390 --> 05:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
families that say oh how much does that
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
cost we can't possibly afford it there's
 
05:12:57.530 --> 05:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
this misconception that everyone that
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
lives around a lake you know can afford
 
05:13:03.250 --> 05:13:03.260 align:start position:0%
whatever and that's not always true so
 
05:13:05.570 --> 05:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
long-winded answer to your question I
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of room for
 
05:13:09.470 --> 05:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
improvement to improve our Lakeside
 
05:13:11.510 --> 05:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
septic systems and homeowners need help
 
05:13:14.510 --> 05:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:16.788 --> 05:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative Kimbrell's
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:13:20.330 --> 05:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
the question we talked earlier about
 
05:13:24.530 --> 05:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
treatment of these algae blooms how many
 
05:13:26.448 --> 05:13:26.458 align:start position:0%
treatments did you actually do last year
 
05:13:28.730 --> 05:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
and at what cost
 
05:13:30.770 --> 05:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
so once are you asked thank you for the
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
questions you're asking once a bloom
 
05:13:34.850 --> 05:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
occurs in a lake what's the manage
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
management to stop it
 
05:13:38.510 --> 05:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
yes I think that'd be important for the
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee to know because I know that
 
05:13:44.330 --> 05:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm on the association on my pond and uh
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
we just we alert it we note it and then
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
we let it let it die out right so right
 
05:13:52.670 --> 05:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
now that's really the only tool there
 
05:13:54.470 --> 05:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
are no tools in the toolbox really right
 
05:13:58.490 --> 05:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
now once a cyanobacteria bloom occurs we
 
05:14:00.770 --> 05:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
have to let nature run its course and
 
05:14:02.570 --> 05:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
let it naturally die off that can be a
 
05:14:04.788 --> 05:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
few days that can be several months
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
so the State Department of Environmental
 
05:14:09.170 --> 05:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
Services and representative rung
 
05:14:12.050 --> 05:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned this they worked on upon nippo
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
Lake in Barrington on an in-lake
 
05:14:17.150 --> 05:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
treatment so putting in aluminum a
 
05:14:21.070 --> 05:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
compound to bind the sediment this that
 
05:14:25.010 --> 05:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
this fund could potentially get that
 
05:14:27.890 --> 05:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
those type of tools more readily used
 
05:14:29.930 --> 05:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
right they hadn't done a treatment like
 
05:14:33.170 --> 05:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
that for 30 years so two summers ago was
 
05:14:34.430 --> 05:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
the first time I'd been done in 30 years
 
05:14:35.930 --> 05:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
so that is something that this fund
 
05:14:38.628 --> 05:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
see no further questions I believe
 
05:14:43.850 --> 05:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a motion I'll
 
05:14:45.708 --> 05:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
ask one question before I made motion if
 
05:14:46.970 --> 05:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
you don't mind
 
05:14:46.980 --> 05:14:48.410 align:start position:0%
you don't mind
um

05:14:48.410 --> 05:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:51.170 --> 05:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
is this something that if we allocate 25
 
05:14:54.530 --> 05:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
million the problem is solved and and
 
05:14:56.930 --> 05:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
will never have any more or is this an
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing thing for the rest of time
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question thank you
 
05:15:02.400 --> 05:15:03.410 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question thank you
um

05:15:03.410 --> 05:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
I I think we can realistically say it's
 
05:15:07.550 --> 05:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
not going to completely solve the
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
problem forever
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
um it is certainly going to give us sort
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the the jump start that we need to
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
start making it much less of a problem
 
05:15:19.368 --> 05:15:19.378 align:start position:0%
um right now we're just basically
 
05:15:21.410 --> 05:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
sitting back and and just letting it
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
happen and we're really can't do
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
anything about it thank you so I'm going
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
to make the motion to retain
 
05:15:31.010 --> 05:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
Saga all right and I I'd like to speak
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
just a briefly absolutely so the main
 
05:15:37.070 --> 05:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill is the funding
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism is is not normal for us this
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
borrows 25 million dollars so this
 
05:15:47.448 --> 05:15:47.458 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't borrow money we spend
 
05:15:49.850 --> 05:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
it right but we tax it we spend it but
 
05:15:51.650 --> 05:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
we don't borrow it that's the Public
 
05:15:54.530 --> 05:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
Works committee and then it's taking
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
this borrowed money in a lot of cases
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
using it for Grants so in a sense we're
 
05:16:01.970 --> 05:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
doing we're we're spending borrowed
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
money on operating expenses right so
 
05:16:07.850 --> 05:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
this isn't very good either so
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have to if we want to
 
05:16:13.550 --> 05:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
put money in this and and we're pretty
 
05:16:16.190 --> 05:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
tight this this budget so we're going to
 
05:16:18.530 --> 05:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
have trouble coming up with kind of
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
money out of operating expenses so
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
anyways so I'm I I think we should
 
05:16:25.070 --> 05:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
retain it and but have to think very
 
05:16:28.850 --> 05:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
hard on how we're going to pay for this
 
05:16:31.430 --> 05:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay the emotions been made to retain it
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
was seconded by a representative Hewitt
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
saying it's just a retain motion show of
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
hands if we're okay with that
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's unanimous thanks for your
 
05:16:45.650 --> 05:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
participation all
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
so next moving right along House Bill
 
05:16:48.000 --> 05:16:54.010 align:start position:0%
so next moving right along House Bill
504

05:16:54.010 --> 05:16:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:02.570 --> 05:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.770 --> 05:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
05:17:05.110 --> 05:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
would you
 
05:17:08.448 --> 05:17:08.458 align:start position:0%
step out for a minute but Mr Hoffman
 
05:17:08.458 --> 05:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
step out for a minute but Mr Hoffman
well

05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
she is out could you give us a little
 
05:17:11.400 --> 05:17:13.190 align:start position:0%
she is out could you give us a little
history

05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
history
 
05:17:16.730 --> 05:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
thanks yes the criminal justice and
 
05:17:18.850 --> 05:17:18.860 align:start position:0%
Public Safety Committee
 
05:17:21.530 --> 05:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
reported this bill ought to pass with a
 
05:17:25.730 --> 05:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
vote of 20-0 and it passed by a Voice
 
05:17:41.628 --> 05:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:45.288 --> 05:17:45.298 align:start position:0%
so 504 is in that packet that you got
 
05:17:47.810 --> 05:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
today so one that we haven't heard
 
05:17:47.820 --> 05:17:49.128 align:start position:0%
today so one that we haven't heard
before

05:17:49.128 --> 05:17:49.138 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
so I'll be with you in just a second
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:08.878 --> 05:19:00.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:19:00.170 --> 05:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%

capacity for approximately nine months
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
so this is my first time through a
 
05:19:19.920 --> 05:19:20.830 align:start position:0%
so this is my first time through a
budget

05:19:20.830 --> 05:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:19:24.288 --> 05:19:24.298 align:start position:0%
type of session I've practiced Lauren
 
05:19:28.330 --> 05:19:28.340 align:start position:0%
and Concord for in excess of 50 years
 
05:19:32.628 --> 05:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
and and have been on the pro board since
 
05:19:32.638 --> 05:19:41.150 align:start position:0%
and and have been on the pro board since
2019.

05:19:53.330 --> 05:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
the the first part of the the bill would
 
05:19:53.340 --> 05:19:54.708 align:start position:0%
the the first part of the the bill would
um

05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
create the ability for the chairperson

to call on people who had previously
 
05:20:03.590 --> 05:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
served on the parole board to fill a

spot
 
05:20:07.850 --> 05:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
in the event that there are was a
 
05:20:10.250 --> 05:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
hearing day in which we couldn't have
 
05:20:13.368 --> 05:20:13.378 align:start position:0%
three members available to sit by way of
 
05:20:16.610 --> 05:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
of background the parole board sits on
 
05:20:16.620 --> 05:20:18.368 align:start position:0%
of background the parole board sits on
revocation

05:20:18.368 --> 05:20:18.378 align:start position:0%
revocation
 
05:20:22.610 --> 05:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
matters on Tuesdays of every of most
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
every week and parole
 
05:20:30.050 --> 05:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
granting on on Thursdays and it's a
 
05:20:32.930 --> 05:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
three-person panel and there are five
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
members of The Adult Parole Board
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
two of whom are attorneys one with law
 
05:20:42.070 --> 05:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement or Correctional Experience
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
One in criminology experience who might
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
be a teacher or whatnot in a
 
05:20:53.810 --> 05:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
post-secondary school and one of what we
 
05:20:56.288 --> 05:20:56.298 align:start position:0%
call General and what we're kind enough
 
05:20:59.090 --> 05:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
or lucky enough I think we have a
 
05:21:01.730 --> 05:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
retired surgeon who sits in that
 
05:21:03.890 --> 05:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
capacity so
 
05:21:07.610 --> 05:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
we um there are times when we can't find
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
three Pro board members who are
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
available uh for instance in April uh
 
05:21:14.750 --> 05:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to do the schedule
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
there were two days where I could find
 
05:21:19.510 --> 05:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
two people that weren't going to be in
 
05:21:23.330 --> 05:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
that would be in state but uh couldn't
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
find the the third and so that would
 
05:21:28.610 --> 05:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
allow us to to call on someone who had
 
05:21:30.368 --> 05:21:30.378 align:start position:0%
previously served
 
05:21:33.170 --> 05:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
that almost like the same thing we do in
 
05:21:36.288 --> 05:21:36.298 align:start position:0%
in courts you know whether with a
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
retired uh justice or or judge to be
 
05:21:43.310 --> 05:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
able to to come back and and serve for a
 
05:21:46.190 --> 05:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
day and that we thought would be
 
05:21:48.650 --> 05:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a fifteen hundred
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
dollar uh appropriation and three
 
05:21:52.970 --> 05:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a day and we didn't
 
05:21:54.830 --> 05:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
think would happen more than five times
 
05:21:58.010 --> 05:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that will be the case
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
the other part is that of the as
 
05:22:04.128 --> 05:22:04.138 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board I'm a full-time
 
05:22:07.610 --> 05:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
state employee but the other members are
 
05:22:11.330 --> 05:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
part-time and initially uh when this was
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
proposed to go from a nine member to a
 
05:22:17.650 --> 05:22:17.660 align:start position:0%
five-member board the salary was was
 
05:22:20.208 --> 05:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
suggested the compensation would be
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand and during the
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
legislative process it got down to 20.
 
05:22:25.798 --> 05:22:26.448 align:start position:0%
legislative process it got down to 20.
um

05:22:26.448 --> 05:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:29.330 --> 05:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
my problem is that sometimes when
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
there's a retirement or a person retires
 
05:22:36.230 --> 05:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
or or especially in the case of trying
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
to find an attorney who would be willing
 
05:22:40.550 --> 05:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
to serve but one must have be an active
 
05:22:42.670 --> 05:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
member of the bar
 
05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:22:45.000 --> 05:22:46.910 align:start position:0%
so that
it's

05:22:46.910 --> 05:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:22:49.550 --> 05:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
it took me almost five months to suggest
 
05:22:52.610 --> 05:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
to find someone would be willing to
 
05:22:54.530 --> 05:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
put his name before the governor and
 
05:22:58.270 --> 05:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
Council to be approved
 
05:23:00.288 --> 05:23:00.298 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:23:04.030 --> 05:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
my concern is that and we ought to
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
attract people who are dedicated to this
 
05:23:10.490 --> 05:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
job it's not an easy one it takes a lot
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
of time
 
05:23:16.850 --> 05:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
to prepare for especially for the parole
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
hearings I think there are 23 separate
 
05:23:19.440 --> 05:23:21.770 align:start position:0%
hearings I think there are 23 separate
categories

05:23:21.770 --> 05:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
categories
 
05:23:25.690 --> 05:23:25.700 align:start position:0%
that we we look at in each parole packet
 
05:23:30.170 --> 05:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
and it in order to to determine whether
 
05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
that person would be appropriate to what
 
05:23:35.770 --> 05:23:35.780 align:start position:0%
has gone through the appropriate
 
05:23:38.288 --> 05:23:38.298 align:start position:0%
programs to be rehabilitated
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated and to the best of our
 
05:23:43.070 --> 05:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
ability that we could predict would not
 
05:23:45.470 --> 05:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
go out and commit another crime and
 
05:23:47.930 --> 05:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
become a good citizen and sometimes
 
05:23:50.690 --> 05:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
we're very lucky sometimes unfortunately
 
05:23:53.930 --> 05:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
that the parole is revoked but with some
 
05:23:56.208 --> 05:23:56.218 align:start position:0%
folks that revocation turns out to work
 
05:23:59.570 --> 05:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
out pretty well and they they see the
 
05:24:02.948 --> 05:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
light and never come back again so
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
but certainly we want to be
 
05:24:09.250 --> 05:24:09.260 align:start position:0%
attract people or fully prepared
 
05:24:13.310 --> 05:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated and willing to serve and I I
 
05:24:15.170 --> 05:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
think for each
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
parole hearing I it's a good 10 to 15
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
hours of preparation
 
05:24:23.690 --> 05:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
before we even get to the to that
 
05:24:26.510 --> 05:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and of course we have the
 
05:24:30.530 --> 05:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
statute requires 35 herrings uh
 
05:24:32.570 --> 05:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
05:24:35.810 --> 05:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
for parole on 35 4.
 
05:24:35.820 --> 05:24:37.788 align:start position:0%
for parole on 35 4.
um

05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
revocations but we we have generally run
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
in the 40s each year for both parole and
 
05:24:47.990 --> 05:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
Pearl revocations
 
05:24:50.628 --> 05:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
so that's the basic thing is I was
 
05:24:53.330 --> 05:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
hoping to get the salary increase from
 
05:24:56.208 --> 05:24:56.218 align:start position:0%
the 20 000 to the thirty thousand so
 
05:24:59.208 --> 05:24:59.218 align:start position:0%
that we can keep and and attract good
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
people and there's a vice chair of the
 
05:25:04.670 --> 05:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
board also we're very lucky to have
 
05:25:08.090 --> 05:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
right now uh that physician filled with
 
05:25:11.448 --> 05:25:11.458 align:start position:0%
Missouri retired captain of a sand of
 
05:25:14.208 --> 05:25:14.218 align:start position:0%
San Quentin as a correctional officer
 
05:25:14.218 --> 05:25:16.310 align:start position:0%
San Quentin as a correctional officer
and

05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:20.810 --> 05:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
he uh uh it was a big help but both he
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
and I are the ones who received the
 
05:25:26.270 --> 05:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
warrants from the ppos the probation and
 
05:25:29.270 --> 05:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
parole officers and we reviewed them and
 
05:25:31.730 --> 05:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
then sign them up there's probable cause
 
05:25:34.970 --> 05:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
for to indicate that there should be an
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
arrest made so
 
05:25:39.708 --> 05:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
that's it and I'm not he not only does
 
05:25:41.390 --> 05:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
that work but there were lots of other
 
05:25:44.090 --> 05:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
things that come up you know in an
 
05:25:47.570 --> 05:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
interpretation of of a sentence or what
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
someone should have been required to do
 
05:25:51.530 --> 05:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
or whatnot so
 
05:25:54.050 --> 05:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
that's why we I have proposed that that
 
05:25:58.850 --> 05:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
budget be another fifty thousand dollars
 
05:26:01.730 --> 05:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
so I have a quick question for you in
 
05:26:04.730 --> 05:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
line 16 it says the vice chairperson
 
05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
shall receive an annual stipend of forty
 
05:26:10.128 --> 05:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to be paid an equal
 
05:26:13.970 --> 05:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
installments I'm I'm curious 40 000 for
 
05:26:16.128 --> 05:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
the vice chair and then you're going
 
05:26:19.070 --> 05:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
down a few lines uh
 
05:26:22.128 --> 05:26:22.138 align:start position:0%
board members except for the chair and
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
vice chairman Shelby paid an annual
 
05:26:27.650 --> 05:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
stipend of thirty thousand correct
 
05:26:30.650 --> 05:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
so on is there what's yeah well so
 
05:26:35.050 --> 05:26:35.060 align:start position:0%
what's the chair get the the
 
05:26:39.670 --> 05:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a client unclassified state employee
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh so it's uh
 
05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
because I guess it's step G
 
05:26:47.040 --> 05:26:48.190 align:start position:0%
because I guess it's step G
um

05:26:48.190 --> 05:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:51.948 --> 05:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
like I've been my my salary uh I think
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
is eighty nine thousand dollars a year
 
05:26:56.208 --> 05:26:56.218 align:start position:0%
you know I was just curious because it
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
had singled out the vice chair and I
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
didn't see any other references so I
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
thought it was kind of odd that he was
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
getting 40 and others may be only
 
05:27:06.110 --> 05:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
getting 30 but it it's something to be
 
05:27:06.120 --> 05:27:07.810 align:start position:0%
getting 30 but it it's something to be
good

05:27:07.810 --> 05:27:07.820 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:27:10.970 --> 05:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
because the additional because the
 
05:27:12.890 --> 05:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
additional work of it of the vice chair
 
05:27:15.530 --> 05:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
05:27:19.330 --> 05:27:19.340 align:start position:0%
are there any questions uh
 
05:27:24.650 --> 05:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:24.660 --> 05:27:25.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:27:25.550 --> 05:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:28.850 --> 05:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
attorney Phillips tell us about that how
 
05:27:33.890 --> 05:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:33.900 --> 05:27:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:41.570 --> 05:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
but let's see the the both for parole I
 
05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if I have these figures rated
 
05:27:46.010 --> 05:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
in in front of me
 
05:27:48.830 --> 05:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I didn't I didn't quite I thought I
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
might be answering some questions I
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
didn't think there'd be a presentation
 
05:27:54.530 --> 05:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
today I should have uh
 
05:27:54.540 --> 05:27:55.250 align:start position:0%
today I should have uh
um

05:27:55.250 --> 05:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:59.390 --> 05:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
looked up a little bit more but
 
05:27:59.400 --> 05:28:01.990 align:start position:0%
looked up a little bit more but
um

05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:05.230 --> 05:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
for instance between
 
05:28:11.090 --> 05:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
2019 and 2022 basic basically we do 45
 
05:28:14.690 --> 05:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
hearings and the number and that would
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
be a matter of usually there are 15 to
 
05:28:22.128 --> 05:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
as many as 20 a day for that I would
 
05:28:28.010 --> 05:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
prefer 15 but uh so it would be 15 times
 
05:28:28.020 --> 05:28:29.230 align:start position:0%
prefer 15 but uh so it would be 15 times
the

05:28:29.230 --> 05:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:33.410 --> 05:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
44 to give you the the number of hearing
 
05:28:33.420 --> 05:28:35.350 align:start position:0%
44 to give you the the number of hearing
days

05:28:35.350 --> 05:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:28:41.448 --> 05:28:41.458 align:start position:0%
and the the number of Parolees really it
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
it differs
 
05:28:47.690 --> 05:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
um I I have to uh admit you know the
 
05:28:50.330 --> 05:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
population of the prison 10 years ago
 
05:28:54.590 --> 05:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
was about 3 000. it has reduced to about
 
05:28:54.600 --> 05:28:56.750 align:start position:0%
was about 3 000. it has reduced to about
2

05:28:56.750 --> 05:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
2
 
05:29:00.050 --> 05:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
000 now I think last month it was 18.
 
05:29:02.030 --> 05:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
but if we're looking at the number of
 
05:29:04.250 --> 05:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
people that are coming in to reduce I
 
05:29:06.590 --> 05:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
think mostly because of covet
 
05:29:09.350 --> 05:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
I mean trials weren't being reached and
 
05:29:09.360 --> 05:29:10.868 align:start position:0%
I mean trials weren't being reached and
and

05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
I spoke at the Barb
 
05:29:17.090 --> 05:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
at the bar meeting last week to a county
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
attorney in fact more than one who
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
well I asked that question he said we
 
05:29:24.120 --> 05:29:25.270 align:start position:0%
well I asked that question he said we
couldn't

05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
expect that there will be more people
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
more trials and more people entering and
 
05:29:34.550 --> 05:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
people entering the system
 
05:29:34.560 --> 05:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
people entering the system
um

05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:40.570 --> 05:29:40.580 align:start position:0%
you know in in 2019 there were about 1
 
05:29:44.750 --> 05:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
then it was reduced to 840 last year was
 
05:29:52.550 --> 05:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
891 I expect it's going to be
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
more that's here
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:03.470 --> 05:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
I noticed Section 3 of The Bill calls
 
05:30:08.208 --> 05:30:08.218 align:start position:0%
for the appropriation of 103 thousand
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
dollars to pay Adult Parole Board uh
 
05:30:14.270 --> 05:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
provide board members daily compensation
 
05:30:14.280 --> 05:30:16.430 align:start position:0%
provide board members daily compensation
uh

05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:30:18.650 --> 05:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
is is there so is there some reason that
 
05:30:22.030 --> 05:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
well right right now they're receiving
 
05:30:27.470 --> 05:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand oh okay all right so
 
05:30:29.708 --> 05:30:29.718 align:start position:0%
that's it that represents the increase
 
05:30:32.330 --> 05:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
of what it would be to provide it up to
 
05:30:34.970 --> 05:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
the 30 and the and that would that would
 
05:30:37.730 --> 05:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
go for for the period ending uh in the
 
05:30:41.090 --> 05:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
end of this fiscal year and then then it
 
05:30:43.850 --> 05:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
takes over the bill takes over as far as
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
the annual salaries after that that's
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.770 --> 05:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
further questions representative McGuire
 
05:30:57.050 --> 05:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
um I do have questions but they're not
 
05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
really of the nature related to the bill
 
05:31:01.670 --> 05:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
I'm more interested in the the parole
 
05:31:05.650 --> 05:31:05.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.690 --> 05:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
05:31:11.208 --> 05:31:11.218 align:start position:0%
do you get good feedback in the sense
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
that you learn later if you made a good
 
05:31:16.250 --> 05:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
decision earlier maybe you're too new in
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
your position
 
05:31:20.930 --> 05:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
um so that you you can improve your the
 
05:31:25.070 --> 05:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:25.080 --> 05:31:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:31:26.390 --> 05:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:31:26.400 --> 05:31:29.030 align:start position:0%
well
the

05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
we know that about 50 percent of the
 
05:31:34.190 --> 05:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
people we parole
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
receive a a warrant to come back for a
 
05:31:37.920 --> 05:31:38.750 align:start position:0%
receive a a warrant to come back for a
return

05:31:38.750 --> 05:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
return
 
05:31:43.070 --> 05:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
so I consider that a failure on that
 
05:31:43.080 --> 05:31:44.230 align:start position:0%
so I consider that a failure on that
part

05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
part
 
05:31:47.930 --> 05:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
I would think that that 50 percent would
 
05:31:52.970 --> 05:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
be reduced to about 20 percent if
 
05:31:56.090 --> 05:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a significant opioid
 
05:31:59.170 --> 05:31:59.180 align:start position:0%
crisis and drug use Crisis crisis
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
and and mental health problems so if if
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
we could address those
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
issues when people are paroled and the
 
05:32:11.868 --> 05:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
to make certain they get can continue
 
05:32:11.878 --> 05:32:13.610 align:start position:0%
to make certain they get can continue
treatment

05:32:13.610 --> 05:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:32:17.448 --> 05:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
um you know I I recognize that that
 
05:32:20.448 --> 05:32:20.458 align:start position:0%
in order to get well from the disease of
 
05:32:23.170 --> 05:32:23.180 align:start position:0%
addiction a person has to want to
 
05:32:26.448 --> 05:32:26.458 align:start position:0%
and they often don't want to until they
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
get in touch with the adverse
 
05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of their disease
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that adverse consequence
 
05:32:38.530 --> 05:32:38.540 align:start position:0%
is continued an incarceration
 
05:32:42.490 --> 05:32:42.500 align:start position:0%
on the other hand if if we have
 
05:32:45.970 --> 05:32:45.980 align:start position:0%
excellent treatment programs out there
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
and by the way people just because they
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
um for instance if if they're paroled
 
05:32:54.770 --> 05:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
and they're supposed to go to a
 
05:32:55.970 --> 05:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
treatment center
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
and they just leave that doesn't mean
 
05:32:59.930 --> 05:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
that there are they have Parolees
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
automatically revoked
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
the PPO works with that person price had
 
05:33:06.890 --> 05:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
got that person into another treatment
 
05:33:10.270 --> 05:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
center I mean there are we have
 
05:33:10.280 --> 05:33:12.670 align:start position:0%
center I mean there are we have
Alternatives

05:33:12.670 --> 05:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
Alternatives
 
05:33:15.530 --> 05:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
that are used and before any warrants
 
05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
issued we require that the PPO indicate
 
05:33:22.128 --> 05:33:22.138 align:start position:0%
to us all the alternative sets that are
 
05:33:22.138 --> 05:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
to us all the alternative sets that are
used

05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:33:24.000 --> 05:33:24.650 align:start position:0%
used
um

05:33:24.650 --> 05:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:27.890 --> 05:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
but I wish I were able to predict human
 
05:33:30.550 --> 05:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
nature and what someone was going to do
 
05:33:32.810 --> 05:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are some real surprises
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
people with very
 
05:33:37.670 --> 05:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
long criminal histories
 
05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
who finally see the light and go out and
 
05:33:41.948 --> 05:33:41.958 align:start position:0%
do well
 
05:33:44.810 --> 05:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
and we don't hear from again the only
 
05:33:46.430 --> 05:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
time we get good
 
05:33:50.930 --> 05:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
idea of that is when a person is within
 
05:33:53.448 --> 05:33:53.458 align:start position:0%
three years of the end of their maximum
 
05:33:53.458 --> 05:33:54.890 align:start position:0%
three years of the end of their maximum
sentence

05:33:54.890 --> 05:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
05:33:59.570 --> 05:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh PPO might recommend that that Max be
 
05:34:01.970 --> 05:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
suspended so that they no longer are
 
05:34:03.650 --> 05:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
under supervision
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
and we see that's one indication where I
 
05:34:10.310 --> 05:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
see people who have done very well uh
 
05:34:13.250 --> 05:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh but I can't say I don't know why one
 
05:34:15.530 --> 05:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
knows so much better than another I I
 
05:34:17.330 --> 05:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
wish I could
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
well you've only seen them very briefly
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
right yes yeah
 
05:34:23.390 --> 05:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
um what fraction of requests for parole
 
05:34:25.550 --> 05:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
are granted
 
05:34:28.628 --> 05:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
um it's it's large I think
 
05:34:31.270 --> 05:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
we had
 
05:34:34.250 --> 05:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's close in
 
05:34:34.260 --> 05:34:35.470 align:start position:0%
it's close in
in

05:34:35.470 --> 05:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:34:39.288 --> 05:34:39.298 align:start position:0%
222 it was 71.3 percent
 
05:34:43.090 --> 05:34:43.100 align:start position:0%
21 69.5
 
05:34:43.100 --> 05:34:44.650 align:start position:0%
21 69.5
in

05:34:44.650 --> 05:34:44.660 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:34:50.208 --> 05:34:50.218 align:start position:0%
2065.4 and in 2019 68.9
 
05:34:52.128 --> 05:34:52.138 align:start position:0%
does that indicate that the sentences
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
are too long
 
05:34:58.128 --> 05:34:58.138 align:start position:0%
well that's
 
05:35:01.070 --> 05:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's interesting way back when
 
05:35:03.530 --> 05:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
I was an undergraduate student in
 
05:35:07.368 --> 05:35:07.378 align:start position:0%
criminology the professor there said a
 
05:35:09.830 --> 05:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
maximum sentence of more than five years
 
05:35:09.840 --> 05:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
maximum sentence of more than five years
is

05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:35:15.708 --> 05:35:15.718 align:start position:0%
not doing that person a world of good in
 
05:35:19.010 --> 05:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
other words that at that
 
05:35:21.770 --> 05:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
they could get the maximum benefit of
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation maybe not punishment but
 
05:35:28.550 --> 05:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation within five years
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
you know that was more than 50 years ago
 
05:35:33.050 --> 05:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
that I hear that I don't know what if
 
05:35:34.970 --> 05:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
there are any studies to really indicate
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
with was better
 
05:35:40.788 --> 05:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
but I have to
 
05:35:43.850 --> 05:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
you know in my short time I mean I time
 
05:35:46.330 --> 05:35:46.340 align:start position:0%
of being on the board
 
05:35:49.368 --> 05:35:49.378 align:start position:0%
I have to admit I'm impressed with the
 
05:35:51.830 --> 05:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections doing the
 
05:35:54.530 --> 05:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
number of programs that has been able to
 
05:35:57.770 --> 05:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
accomplish especially with with the
 
05:36:00.050 --> 05:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
staff shortages they've had they're
 
05:36:02.270 --> 05:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
still able to do and during covert times
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
I think we had one of the best rates of
 
05:36:08.448 --> 05:36:08.458 align:start position:0%
the whole nation of not having covert
 
05:36:11.150 --> 05:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
run through our prison and having people
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
second die
 
05:36:16.910 --> 05:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your responses and thanks
 
05:36:18.110 --> 05:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
for what you're doing represent
 
05:36:20.628 --> 05:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
cambrells thank you Mr chair
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so these other employees are
 
05:36:25.510 --> 05:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
part-time baked enough full-time
 
05:36:28.070 --> 05:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
how many hours per year did they would
 
05:36:30.350 --> 05:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
you say they put in to do their jobs you
 
05:36:32.628 --> 05:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
mean what we're talking about is board
 
05:36:34.010 --> 05:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
members the board the three board
 
05:36:35.810 --> 05:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
members in the vice chair yes how many
 
05:36:37.430 --> 05:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
hours per year would you say they put in
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
well we know that they're going to serve
 
05:36:43.010 --> 05:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
at least one to two days a week
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
in a hearing at you know 44
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
times or more it might be uh eight you
 
05:36:53.930 --> 05:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
know they could serve 80 days you know
 
05:36:56.510 --> 05:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay we don't we really don't times how
 
05:37:00.110 --> 05:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
many hours per day yeah and uh
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
revocation hearings start at 8 30 in the
 
05:37:02.638 --> 05:37:03.770 align:start position:0%
revocation hearings start at 8 30 in the
morning

05:37:03.770 --> 05:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:37:05.868 --> 05:37:05.878 align:start position:0%
and it depends if people work out an
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
agreement or not but they usually go to
 
05:37:11.470 --> 05:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
three uh 2 30 or three in the afternoon
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes till five depending upon the
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
length of the hair the the reason I ask
 
05:37:19.128 --> 05:37:19.138 align:start position:0%
the question is because
 
05:37:22.550 --> 05:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
these are Hefty raises 50 in one case
 
05:37:25.970 --> 05:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
100 raised in another case and you're
 
05:37:28.850 --> 05:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
talking about part-time jobs that you're
 
05:37:31.128 --> 05:37:31.138 align:start position:0%
not talking two thousand hours a year
 
05:37:33.708 --> 05:37:33.718 align:start position:0%
so I don't know any job that gets those
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
kind of level raises so what you know
 
05:37:37.730 --> 05:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
what would be your justification for
 
05:37:42.410 --> 05:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
that well I I hadn't done the statistics
 
05:37:44.510 --> 05:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the time
 
05:37:47.208 --> 05:37:47.218 align:start position:0%
and I will I wasn't prepared for that
 
05:37:50.990 --> 05:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
today but if if you're in order to get
 
05:37:53.150 --> 05:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
prepared for One Parole hearing it's
 
05:37:55.128 --> 05:37:55.138 align:start position:0%
more than that hearing day
 
05:37:58.128 --> 05:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
one that often uh
 
05:38:01.610 --> 05:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
I've spent up to 50 dollars uh just
 
05:38:03.050 --> 05:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
doing a
 
05:38:05.530 --> 05:38:05.540 align:start position:0%
um a parole hearing
 
05:38:08.230 --> 05:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
for that day's hearing
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
and some are able to do it a little bit
 
05:38:15.410 --> 05:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
faster but 10 to 15 hours for that and
 
05:38:18.288 --> 05:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
then if you're also doing revocations so
 
05:38:21.910 --> 05:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
you're doing that that whole hearing day
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
which can be seven or eight hours
 
05:38:28.490 --> 05:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
depending upon what happens and that it
 
05:38:31.270 --> 05:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the preparation time
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
and for parole revocations they take
 
05:38:37.670 --> 05:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
less time in preparation but more time
 
05:38:39.470 --> 05:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
for hearings
 
05:38:44.110 --> 05:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
so uh but in order to to for instance
 
05:38:47.690 --> 05:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
attracted attorney on a attorney who's
 
05:38:51.770 --> 05:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
retired who wanted to be of council to a
 
05:38:54.050 --> 05:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
firm could certainly be making more than
 
05:38:57.650 --> 05:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:57.660 --> 05:38:58.970 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:39:01.010 --> 05:39:01.020 align:start position:0%

05:41:44.448 --> 05:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
so uh 269 relative to limiting The
 
05:41:46.670 --> 05:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
Authority of New Hampshire delegates to
 
05:41:50.030 --> 05:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
policy making conventions whatever it
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
happens could you give us a little
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:58.670 --> 05:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
Mrs Rawlins oh miss Rollins yeah thank
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
you this was referred to the state
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
federal relations and Veterans Affair
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
committee it came out of the committee
 
05:42:07.128 --> 05:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
with the ought to pass with Amendment
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
with a vote of 18-0 it then went to the
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
floor and came off the floor with the
 
05:42:17.448 --> 05:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:19.430 --> 05:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much is there
 
05:42:28.128 --> 05:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
not determine yes it represents Sweeney
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I would say looking at
 
05:42:34.010 --> 05:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note there really doesn't
 
05:42:39.590 --> 05:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
seem to be a heft to this bill so
 
05:42:42.050 --> 05:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh seeing as the policy was already
 
05:42:43.850 --> 05:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
largely approved by the house and it
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
seems more like it's just a policy Bill
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
than anything else I think I would move
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
out to pass this is really no impact on
 
05:42:50.878 --> 05:42:52.430 align:start position:0%
out to pass this is really no impact on
fiscal

05:42:52.430 --> 05:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
05:42:54.410 --> 05:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
issues representative McGuire are you
 
05:42:56.570 --> 05:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
seconding that no I I'd like to suggest
 
05:42:58.010 --> 05:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
05:43:00.170 --> 05:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
oh well I will second it for discussion
 
05:43:04.010 --> 05:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so on page two line 20.
 
05:43:07.250 --> 05:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
so the peoples in this convention and I
 
05:43:08.690 --> 05:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
don't know if these conventions are ever
 
05:43:12.708 --> 05:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
but you should know tell us a history
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah right exactly but these are these
 
05:43:21.230 --> 05:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
are legislators right
 
05:43:23.448 --> 05:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
um whenever a contention is held the
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's four men four members from the
 
05:43:27.530 --> 05:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
house three members from the Senate
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
right or something like that
 
05:43:30.840 --> 05:43:31.610 align:start position:0%
right or something like that
um

05:43:31.610 --> 05:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:35.930 --> 05:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
and so or two mem one from the Senate to
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
Etc so so these are legislators and
 
05:43:41.570 --> 05:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
therefore I I would move that we would
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
get rid of line four there which is I
 
05:43:48.650 --> 05:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
mean the Roman four on page two line 20.
 
05:43:52.128 --> 05:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
which is the hundred dollars a day
 
05:43:55.628 --> 05:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
so you know expense is fine but pay
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
seems to be not our thing so so the
 
05:44:00.890 --> 05:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars per day yeah so I would
 
05:44:04.250 --> 05:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
ask for an amendment to remove lines 20
 
05:44:06.470 --> 05:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
and 21 on page two
 
05:44:09.170 --> 05:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
the division okay with that
 
05:44:12.890 --> 05:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
it represents Sweeney yeah
 
05:44:15.048 --> 05:44:15.058 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
I went to uh won some years ago this is
 
05:44:21.170 --> 05:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention and we were
 
05:44:23.150 --> 05:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
doing some rule
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um making for that convention because we
 
05:44:27.890 --> 05:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough people yet to call
 
05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
the Article 5 convention there were
 
05:44:33.288 --> 05:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
about I think 18 or 19 states that have
 
05:44:36.650 --> 05:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
voted for it at the time and and you
 
05:44:38.330 --> 05:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
need to have
 
05:44:38.340 --> 05:44:40.430 align:start position:0%
need to have
30

05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
30
 
05:44:43.610 --> 05:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
two states I think to agree to call it
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
and 38th states to approve the actions
 
05:44:50.208 --> 05:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have 32 states but we we
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
met I don't remember getting paid a
 
05:44:54.110 --> 05:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a day I think I might
 
05:44:55.610 --> 05:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
have got expenses
 
05:44:57.948 --> 05:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
it isn't well like I was worried about
 
05:44:59.930 --> 05:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
it but there was there was a pretty good
 
05:45:02.448 --> 05:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
sized group of us there
 
05:45:02.458 --> 05:45:03.170 align:start position:0%
sized group of us there
um

05:45:03.170 --> 05:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:04.970 --> 05:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
most of whom are no longer in the
 
05:45:06.410 --> 05:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
legislature so it was a while ago
 
05:45:08.930 --> 05:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
although Senator Innis has come back he
 
05:45:13.368 --> 05:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
was on that and Gary Daniels and I think
 
05:45:17.628 --> 05:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:20.570 --> 05:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
you know blanking out from Northwood up
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:25.610 --> 05:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
anyway what was it
 
05:45:25.620 --> 05:45:28.128 align:start position:0%
anyway what was it
Reagan

05:45:28.128 --> 05:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
Reagan
 
05:45:28.138 --> 05:45:29.090 align:start position:0%
Reagan
um

05:45:29.090 --> 05:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:29.100 --> 05:45:30.170 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:45:30.170 --> 05:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:45:32.990 --> 05:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
it was a worthwhile thing and the whole
 
05:45:35.628 --> 05:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
purpose of it is to try to control this
 
05:45:37.670 --> 05:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
runaway spending that's going on in the
 
05:45:39.890 --> 05:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
in the Congress they've they've gone
 
05:45:41.330 --> 05:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes eight and ten years without
 
05:45:42.890 --> 05:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
passing a budget
 
05:45:46.250 --> 05:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
I mean this is ridiculous so that was
 
05:45:48.788 --> 05:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
one of the purposes of of doing this and
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
the big argument is not only that
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Congress is manipulating it to say
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
well we haven't had the total number
 
05:46:00.530 --> 05:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
there really have been more
 
05:46:02.990 --> 05:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
but if if the words weren't exactly the
 
05:46:05.390 --> 05:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
same and including the punctuation no no
 
05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough
 
05:46:09.708 --> 05:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
and then they stall anyway so
 
05:46:12.110 --> 05:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's really been a fight to try to get
 
05:46:14.330 --> 05:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
this article 5 convention and everybody
 
05:46:16.610 --> 05:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
talks about a runaway convention
 
05:46:20.270 --> 05:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
and that's not possible all you need is
 
05:46:22.610 --> 05:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
13 states to say no
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
and whatever they did doesn't pass and I
 
05:46:28.128 --> 05:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
can easily think of 13 states that would
 
05:46:30.350 --> 05:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
not allow some crazy stuff to go
 
05:46:30.360 --> 05:46:31.548 align:start position:0%
not allow some crazy stuff to go
but

05:46:31.548 --> 05:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:46:33.708 --> 05:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
anyway it's even going to be hard to get
 
05:46:35.570 --> 05:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
38 states to say you've got to balance
 
05:46:36.708 --> 05:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
05:46:38.030 --> 05:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
because we know
 
05:46:41.030 --> 05:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
half a dozen that never do
 
05:46:42.850 --> 05:46:42.860 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
05:46:46.128 --> 05:46:46.138 align:start position:0%
the latitude representative we're ahead
 
05:46:49.010 --> 05:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
of schedule so yeah understood but I
 
05:46:51.530 --> 05:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
think it's a worthwhile thing to do and
 
05:46:54.410 --> 05:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
I hope we uh we pass this
 
05:46:56.890 --> 05:46:56.900 align:start position:0%
all right so looking at the fiscal note
 
05:46:59.090 --> 05:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
it would appear
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
that if you go to page it's the last
 
05:47:04.610 --> 05:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
page another fiscal note
 
05:47:07.368 --> 05:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
that already members are entitled to 98
 
05:47:11.390 --> 05:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
daily for lodging and 59 for meals with
 
05:47:13.430 --> 05:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
adding the hundred dollar payment that
 
05:47:14.810 --> 05:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire would like to
 
05:47:14.820 --> 05:47:15.670 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire would like to
delete

05:47:15.670 --> 05:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
delete
 
05:47:18.470 --> 05:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
if that isn't deleted the delegates
 
05:47:21.530 --> 05:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
would get 257 dollars
 
05:47:21.540 --> 05:47:23.208 align:start position:0%
would get 257 dollars
day

05:47:23.208 --> 05:47:23.218 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:47:25.910 --> 05:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
so there is a
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
motion just for clarity the motion was
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
made in I think seconded yes by you yeah
 
05:47:35.350 --> 05:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
I made for discussion
 
05:47:37.850 --> 05:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
this is it a separate boat to have the
 
05:47:39.708 --> 05:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
amendment it would be a separate photo
 
05:47:39.718 --> 05:47:40.910 align:start position:0%
amendment it would be a separate photo
yeah

05:47:40.910 --> 05:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:47:40.920 --> 05:47:42.110 align:start position:0%
yeah
this

05:47:42.110 --> 05:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:47:45.948 --> 05:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
procedurally if I withdrew my motion can
 
05:47:47.570 --> 05:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
we make the amendment and then do
 
05:47:48.830 --> 05:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
another well we could vote on the
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
amendment if you withdraw sure I'll
 
05:47:54.288 --> 05:47:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:56.570 --> 05:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
05:48:01.430 --> 05:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
line 20 and 21. yeah but 21. you
 
05:48:03.048 --> 05:48:03.058 align:start position:0%
originally said you were considered
 
05:48:05.930 --> 05:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
today right he wants to withdraw that oh
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying yes
 
05:48:11.208 --> 05:48:11.218 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry so Shelby
 
05:48:11.218 --> 05:48:12.170 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry so Shelby
um

05:48:12.170 --> 05:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:14.208 --> 05:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
really I guess my amendment is just
 
05:48:16.010 --> 05:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
remove the words paid a hundred dollars
 
05:48:19.090 --> 05:48:19.100 align:start position:0%
per day right and so
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
you're right thank you for pointing that
 
05:48:25.250 --> 05:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
right shall be reimbursed for actual
 
05:48:27.770 --> 05:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
experience oh second then yeah okay what
 
05:48:31.448 --> 05:48:31.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:35.810 --> 05:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
right now right so we're removing the
 
05:48:38.330 --> 05:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
words paid through the word in 20 and
 
05:48:38.340 --> 05:48:42.368 align:start position:0%
words paid through the word in 20 and
20.

05:48:42.368 --> 05:48:42.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:48.048 --> 05:48:48.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:48.058 --> 05:48:52.930 align:start position:0%
 
157.

05:48:52.930 --> 05:48:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.448 --> 05:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:59.090 --> 05:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe so well no I don't think
 
05:49:05.470 --> 05:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is a brand new chapter it's adding
 
05:49:12.670 --> 05:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 20-c so
 
05:49:15.770 --> 05:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
I think it's all new the greatness of
 
05:49:17.628 --> 05:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
the whole thing was to say if we send
 
05:49:19.670 --> 05:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
you to the convention you are selected
 
05:49:21.530 --> 05:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
as the thing here's what you're going to
 
05:49:23.868 --> 05:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
do you're going to make them pass a
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
balanced budget and have Fair elections
 
05:49:27.288 --> 05:49:27.298 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
05:49:30.048 --> 05:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
so if some if if somebody in our group
 
05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
decides you know I think we need to do
 
05:49:34.128 --> 05:49:34.138 align:start position:0%
more than that I think we need to make
 
05:49:36.470 --> 05:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
this and that now wait a minute you're
 
05:49:36.480 --> 05:49:37.850 align:start position:0%
this and that now wait a minute you're
recalled

05:49:37.850 --> 05:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
recalled
 
05:49:40.310 --> 05:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
because that's what this is for we told
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
you we told you the two things you were
 
05:49:45.890 --> 05:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:45.900 --> 05:49:47.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:49:50.090 --> 05:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
well we've passed this before and then I
 
05:49:51.230 --> 05:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
think it's either
 
05:49:51.240 --> 05:49:53.708 align:start position:0%
think it's either
been

05:49:53.708 --> 05:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
removed or outdated or something but I
 
05:49:59.868 --> 05:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
remember it we passed this before
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
see I've traveled to ncsl events and so
 
05:50:04.930 --> 05:50:04.940 align:start position:0%
forth and I've always rejected any
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
compensation but legislators are
 
05:50:10.750 --> 05:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
entitled to compensation
 
05:50:13.730 --> 05:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
we don't get much either but
 
05:50:16.250 --> 05:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire are we clear
 
05:50:18.470 --> 05:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
on your yes or the amendment is on line
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
20. remove the words paid 100 per day
 
05:50:22.200 --> 05:50:24.410 align:start position:0%
20. remove the words paid 100 per day
and

05:50:24.410 --> 05:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:50:24.420 --> 05:50:25.610 align:start position:0%
and
okay

05:50:25.610 --> 05:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:50:28.430 --> 05:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved and it was seconded
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
by representative Griffin
 
05:50:30.958 --> 05:50:32.090 align:start position:0%
by representative Griffin
um

05:50:32.090 --> 05:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:34.850 --> 05:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
05:50:34.860 --> 05:50:40.190 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
um

05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:44.150 --> 05:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
it I don't see I'm I'm reading it as I
 
05:50:46.270 --> 05:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
go along but I I don't see
 
05:50:49.670 --> 05:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
where in this bill there's any
 
05:50:52.730 --> 05:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
suggestion of of
 
05:50:55.250 --> 05:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
what an unauthorized
 
05:50:57.850 --> 05:50:57.860 align:start position:0%
motion is
 
05:51:02.270 --> 05:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:05.090 --> 05:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
what page are you on I'm looking at the
 
05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
whole the whole thing the definition of
 
05:51:13.310 --> 05:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
a delegate an interstate convention uh
 
05:51:15.170 --> 05:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
says that there's been there'll be a
 
05:51:17.270 --> 05:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
convention but it doesn't say when I
 
05:51:19.850 --> 05:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
heard I heard Representatives while I
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
say that it would be prevent you from
 
05:51:21.840 --> 05:51:24.230 align:start position:0%
say that it would be prevent you from
not

05:51:24.230 --> 05:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:51:27.110 --> 05:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
but not yet not voting for a balanced
 
05:51:29.090 --> 05:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
budget or something like that I don't
 
05:51:32.448 --> 05:51:32.458 align:start position:0%
see anything in here that says what you
 
05:51:34.610 --> 05:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
can and can't vote for and I may just be
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
missing it
 
05:51:39.230 --> 05:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Sweeney I see it it
 
05:51:41.330 --> 05:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
just talks about unauthorized amendments
 
05:51:45.470 --> 05:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:47.570 --> 05:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
you represent a Sweeney followed by
 
05:51:50.510 --> 05:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler no just jumping
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
off of what we're up there while they
 
05:51:53.570 --> 05:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
were saying uh the permitted scope means
 
05:51:55.310 --> 05:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
the topic or of an amendment or specific
 
05:51:57.288 --> 05:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
language of amendment that may or
 
05:51:59.090 --> 05:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
proposal that may be considered By Any
 
05:52:00.770 --> 05:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
Given Interstate or Interstate can mean
 
05:52:03.048 --> 05:52:03.058 align:start position:0%
body uh in which the numerous states are
 
05:52:04.850 --> 05:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
represent I think the the authorized
 
05:52:07.850 --> 05:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
State scope is set in the resolutions
 
05:52:10.490 --> 05:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
that would pass to form the Article 5
 
05:52:12.948 --> 05:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
convention separate from this and this
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
is just saying that the delegates from
 
05:52:17.510 --> 05:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are not authorized to move
 
05:52:20.570 --> 05:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
or support any unauthorized so it's in
 
05:52:22.730 --> 05:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
the separate resolutions that the states
 
05:52:25.310 --> 05:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
would pass to form the Article Five
 
05:52:28.850 --> 05:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
is what the authorized scope is and
 
05:52:31.788 --> 05:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
isn't in this case and not in this bill
 
05:52:33.650 --> 05:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
and this bill just binds the delegates
 
05:52:35.448 --> 05:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
to whatever that authorized scope is
 
05:52:37.910 --> 05:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the issue that led to
 
05:52:39.650 --> 05:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
the convention
 
05:52:43.310 --> 05:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
and then on page two line 24.
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:54.110 --> 05:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
yeah my question is what is an
 
05:52:57.830 --> 05:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:57.840 --> 05:52:59.868 align:start position:0%
 
it's

05:52:59.868 --> 05:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:53:03.230 --> 05:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
this just has a structure
 
05:53:06.288 --> 05:53:06.298 align:start position:0%
this creates a structure for if you're
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
going to a convention here's who goes
 
05:53:11.208 --> 05:53:11.218 align:start position:0%
here's what they're paid Etc right
 
05:53:14.330 --> 05:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
correct here's what they do but to
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
create to send people to a convention
 
05:53:19.548 --> 05:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
you need a separate resolution like like
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
last week we failed uh HCR one right
 
05:53:27.048 --> 05:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
that would have sent people to a to a
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
convention and in HCR one it said this
 
05:53:33.830 --> 05:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
is a convention to balance the budget or
 
05:53:35.150 --> 05:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
something like that right to control
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
suspended so so it's not in here because
 
05:53:41.930 --> 05:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
you could have a resolution to you know
 
05:53:44.770 --> 05:53:44.780 align:start position:0%
add a second vice president or something
 
05:53:44.780 --> 05:53:46.390 align:start position:0%
add a second vice president or something
right

05:53:46.390 --> 05:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:53:49.610 --> 05:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
and Roman two on that page also yeah
 
05:53:55.070 --> 05:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.850 --> 05:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:02.330 --> 05:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
so we'll just have a show a hands on the
 
05:54:04.128 --> 05:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
McGuire Amendment
 
05:54:09.410 --> 05:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:13.310 --> 05:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%

those of you who don't know it was my
 
06:04:23.170 --> 06:04:23.180 align:start position:0%
vice chairman for a term
 
06:04:27.470 --> 06:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
two terms we had to put labels on the
 
06:04:31.868 --> 06:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:35.330 --> 06:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
anyway well thank you Mr chairman nice
 
06:04:39.110 --> 06:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
to be back in division one again
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
um this is um
 
06:04:43.430 --> 06:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is something we fell upon a few
 
06:04:44.810 --> 06:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
years back
 
06:04:44.820 --> 06:04:46.010 align:start position:0%
years back
um

06:04:46.010 --> 06:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:48.948 --> 06:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
this is a death benefit for police and
 
06:04:52.430 --> 06:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
fire who get killed in a line of duty
 
06:04:54.970 --> 06:04:54.980 align:start position:0%
um you know they're out protecting us
 
06:04:58.490 --> 06:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
our families our property and if they
 
06:05:00.470 --> 06:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
get killed in a line of duty
 
06:05:02.510 --> 06:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
dispose only gets half of their
 
06:05:02.520 --> 06:05:04.310 align:start position:0%
dispose only gets half of their
retirement

06:05:04.310 --> 06:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
06:05:06.470 --> 06:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
they could go
 
06:05:09.410 --> 06:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
skydiving and get killed and
 
06:05:11.810 --> 06:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
their family would get their full
 
06:05:14.030 --> 06:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
retirement so it doesn't really make
 
06:05:16.730 --> 06:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
sense that they're working for us
 
06:05:18.650 --> 06:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
they get killed
 
06:05:20.810 --> 06:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
and the spouse only gets half and the
 
06:05:22.490 --> 06:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
family only gets half
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times you know the people
 
06:05:28.490 --> 06:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
that are the younger people that are the
 
06:05:30.530 --> 06:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
ones that are In Harm's Way more than
 
06:05:32.750 --> 06:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
the older people sitting behind a desk
 
06:05:32.760 --> 06:05:33.890 align:start position:0%
the older people sitting behind a desk
so

06:05:33.890 --> 06:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
a young family
 
06:05:36.240 --> 06:05:37.490 align:start position:0%
a young family
um

06:05:37.490 --> 06:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:39.890 --> 06:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
really needs every everything they can
 
06:05:39.900 --> 06:05:40.610 align:start position:0%
really needs every everything they can
get

06:05:40.610 --> 06:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:05:44.448 --> 06:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
and this is just a fairness thing and uh
 
06:05:50.448 --> 06:05:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:51.770 --> 06:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
06:05:54.470 --> 06:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative representative thank you
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes it says accidental death it
 
06:05:59.510 --> 06:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anywhere here on the job
 
06:06:02.208 --> 06:06:02.218 align:start position:0%
would it also if they just died in a
 
06:06:03.708 --> 06:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
skiing accident
 
06:06:05.750 --> 06:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
I don't see anywhere it says accidental
 
06:06:07.548 --> 06:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
death doesn't say on the job anywhere as
 
06:06:10.190 --> 06:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
far as I can I can tell again I have
 
06:06:12.470 --> 06:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
nothing against the bill but that is a
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
big distinction I don't remember how it
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
reads but it's um
 
06:06:19.490 --> 06:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
it is in the line of duty if they get
 
06:06:21.230 --> 06:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
killed in a line of Duties when they get
 
06:06:23.208 --> 06:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
penalized agreed but that's not what the
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill says
 
06:06:27.288 --> 06:06:27.298 align:start position:0%
the bill says accidental death
 
06:06:31.310 --> 06:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.250 --> 06:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh if if anyone wishes to speak if you
 
06:06:37.970 --> 06:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
could just grab the mics come on up
 
06:06:40.250 --> 06:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
yeah like I said I don't remember it
 
06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
we'll hear it we'll hear from the
 
06:06:44.090 --> 06:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative from the state retirement
 
06:06:46.010 --> 06:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
system thank you
 
06:06:47.810 --> 06:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
Mark Cavanaugh associate Council
 
06:06:50.448 --> 06:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
compliance officer accidental death is
 
06:06:52.670 --> 06:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
our term of art for work related death
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
under our statute under RSA 100 a it's
 
06:06:59.628 --> 06:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
called accidental versus ordinary which
 
06:07:02.930 --> 06:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
is a non-work related death
 
06:07:05.750 --> 06:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that clarification
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
06:07:10.610 --> 06:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
baroody represent Maguire thank you very
 
06:07:12.948 --> 06:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative I I guess
 
06:07:15.230 --> 06:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
I don't understand what you mean I think
 
06:07:18.170 --> 06:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
you're you're conflating retirement pay
 
06:07:20.830 --> 06:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit and compensation
 
06:07:25.190 --> 06:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
because what this is is 50 of
 
06:07:27.530 --> 06:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
compensation what your current salary is
 
06:07:31.548 --> 06:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
Right versus you said they get if
 
06:07:34.010 --> 06:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
someone died just from any other cause
 
06:07:36.650 --> 06:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
they would get a hundred percent of
 
06:07:39.288 --> 06:07:39.298 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits which is a different
 
06:07:42.470 --> 06:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
number correct no it's it's I believe
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
it's the same it's their benefit that
 
06:07:45.770 --> 06:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
they get
 
06:07:47.868 --> 06:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
at the time of their death
 
06:07:49.970 --> 06:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
either an accidental death or an
 
06:07:52.310 --> 06:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
ordinary death if it's an accidental
 
06:07:54.770 --> 06:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
death which I said is in the line of
 
06:07:58.368 --> 06:07:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:01.490 --> 06:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
so so there must be another a different
 
06:08:04.910 --> 06:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
section that covers the other 100 yes
 
06:08:07.128 --> 06:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it does
 
06:08:09.230 --> 06:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
could you give us let's just pulled out
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the section that we thought was wrong
 
06:08:14.990 --> 06:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
which was the accidental death which is
 
06:08:18.410 --> 06:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:21.530 --> 06:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
you were recently given a brief by the
 
06:08:24.010 --> 06:08:24.020 align:start position:0%
retirement system it's got some
 
06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
clarifying language for the death
 
06:08:26.878 --> 06:08:28.448 align:start position:0%
clarifying language for the death
benefits

06:08:28.448 --> 06:08:28.458 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
06:08:31.128 --> 06:08:31.138 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
yeah this is similar to the previous
 
06:08:39.010 --> 06:08:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
compensation average final compensation
 
06:08:43.670 --> 06:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
is a term about used by the retirement
 
06:08:45.890 --> 06:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
system uh
 
06:08:48.470 --> 06:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that's how that's how it's
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:57.350 --> 06:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's a total compensation it's sort of
 
06:08:59.110 --> 06:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
like saying that it was accidental death
 
06:09:01.670 --> 06:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's not a that's not a term of Art
 
06:09:05.570 --> 06:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
and if you say our accidental death the
 
06:09:07.368 --> 06:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
retirement system won't be obligated to
 
06:09:10.070 --> 06:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
pay anything likewise the what they
 
06:09:12.410 --> 06:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
calculate the amount
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
by average compensation
 
06:09:18.650 --> 06:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
and not average salary
 
06:09:20.810 --> 06:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
I've got that right
 
06:09:27.288 --> 06:09:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:29.628 --> 06:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
06:09:32.330 --> 06:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
under our statute there are two death
 
06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
benefits ordinary not work related
 
06:09:37.970 --> 06:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
accidental work related
 
06:09:37.980 --> 06:09:38.750 align:start position:0%
accidental work related
um

06:09:38.750 --> 06:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:41.150 --> 06:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify for the ordinary
 
06:09:43.970 --> 06:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
the benefit is
 
06:09:45.770 --> 06:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
06:09:48.590 --> 06:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
of the retirement Service retirement the
 
06:09:50.030 --> 06:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
member would have been eligible for at
 
06:09:52.070 --> 06:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
that time so for instance very young
 
06:09:53.208 --> 06:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
they might not have been eligible for
 
06:09:53.218 --> 06:09:54.410 align:start position:0%
they might not have been eligible for
anything

06:09:54.410 --> 06:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:09:54.420 --> 06:09:56.270 align:start position:0%
anything
accidental

06:09:56.270 --> 06:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
accidental
 
06:09:56.280 --> 06:09:57.770 align:start position:0%
accidental
is

06:09:57.770 --> 06:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:10:01.430 --> 06:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
for group twos currently 50 percent
 
06:10:04.490 --> 06:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
of their annual earnable compensation
 
06:10:07.430 --> 06:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
which we count as what was paid the last
 
06:10:09.770 --> 06:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
12 months not a three-year average not a
 
06:10:11.208 --> 06:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
five-year average
 
06:10:13.490 --> 06:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
accidental is paid regardless of years
 
06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
of service and it's also tax-free
 
06:10:20.150 --> 06:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
ordinary disability death benefits are
 
06:10:20.160 --> 06:10:21.410 align:start position:0%
ordinary disability death benefits are
taxable

06:10:21.410 --> 06:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
06:10:24.288 --> 06:10:24.298 align:start position:0%
and it's a lower benefit and if the
 
06:10:26.570 --> 06:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
member who's passing away hasn't yet
 
06:10:26.580 --> 06:10:27.948 align:start position:0%
member who's passing away hasn't yet
qualified

06:10:27.948 --> 06:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
06:10:29.690 --> 06:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
Forest Service retirement because
 
06:10:31.548 --> 06:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
they're only 40
 
06:10:34.250 --> 06:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
well well group twos you know they
 
06:10:36.470 --> 06:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
haven't reached that age there's no
 
06:10:40.670 --> 06:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
early retirement for group twos so under
 
06:10:44.570 --> 06:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
ordinary death it's it's a a much lower
 
06:10:47.510 --> 06:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
benefit Than The Accidental
 
06:10:49.548 --> 06:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
and know what this bill is proposing to
 
06:10:53.410 --> 06:10:53.420 align:start position:0%
do is they take it from 50 of annual
 
06:10:56.990 --> 06:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
compensation to 100 and just to draw a
 
06:10:59.208 --> 06:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
contrast the group one accidental
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
benefit on the job death is
 
06:11:06.110 --> 06:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh 50 of final average compensation
 
06:11:07.910 --> 06:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that is three and five years so this
 
06:11:09.110 --> 06:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the two
 
06:11:12.350 --> 06:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
this one's slightly more not very much
 
06:11:15.288 --> 06:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
depending on how the averages are but
 
06:11:17.448 --> 06:11:17.458 align:start position:0%
those are the distinctions between
 
06:11:20.930 --> 06:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
section 88 and section 89. are there any
 
06:11:24.288 --> 06:11:24.298 align:start position:0%
group ones who are earning this who who
 
06:11:24.298 --> 06:11:25.750 align:start position:0%
group ones who are earning this who who
died

06:11:25.750 --> 06:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
died
 
06:11:28.670 --> 06:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
you know mostly Dot
 
06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
people who got hurt in car truck
 
06:11:32.990 --> 06:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
accidents and working you know people in
 
06:11:34.368 --> 06:11:34.378 align:start position:0%
the more hazardous positions they're a
 
06:11:36.110 --> 06:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
few scattered around
 
06:11:37.788 --> 06:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
there's more
 
06:11:40.070 --> 06:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
I believe there's more I'm going to say
 
06:11:41.390 --> 06:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
there's more there's a higher percentage
 
06:11:43.788 --> 06:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
and a much higher likelihood
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
in group two
 
06:11:46.610 --> 06:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
there may be more in group one because
 
06:11:48.230 --> 06:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's a much bigger group
 
06:11:50.150 --> 06:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not it's not a lot issue to see
 
06:11:51.288 --> 06:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
on the back of the
 
06:11:54.288 --> 06:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
Bill brief I believe there's only 19
 
06:11:55.970 --> 06:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
people collecting this benefit in group
 
06:11:57.890 --> 06:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
two right now
 
06:12:00.470 --> 06:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
brother but yes now would the cost of
 
06:12:05.090 --> 06:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
this bill go on the the employers
 
06:12:08.090 --> 06:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
whether they be state or Municipal yes
 
06:12:09.890 --> 06:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
and that's on the second page the back
 
06:12:11.868 --> 06:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
page of the bill brief it shows
 
06:12:14.330 --> 06:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
what the what the impact would be
 
06:12:16.250 --> 06:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
on the contributions as well as the
 
06:12:16.260 --> 06:12:17.570 align:start position:0%
on the contributions as well as the
underfunding

06:12:17.570 --> 06:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
underfunding
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
06:12:20.990 --> 06:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
larger for political Subs in the States
 
06:12:24.530 --> 06:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
because that's a much bigger group
 
06:12:26.448 --> 06:12:26.458 align:start position:0%
um but it's a relatively
 
06:12:28.730 --> 06:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
okay not a huge number 19 million I
 
06:12:31.548 --> 06:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
think okay and one more question so how
 
06:12:35.448 --> 06:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
do we know the specific number this 2026
 
06:12:37.730 --> 06:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
number of 320
 
06:12:39.708 --> 06:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
000 is that because there's a certain
 
06:12:41.690 --> 06:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
number of people in this yes we took to
 
06:12:43.010 --> 06:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
people who actually collecting the
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
benefits and made some projections as to
 
06:12:47.628 --> 06:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
what new people might be collecting and
 
06:12:49.788 --> 06:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
what they're you know based on the
 
06:12:51.770 --> 06:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
frequency of the current population is
 
06:12:53.628 --> 06:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions okay so this is
 
06:12:55.070 --> 06:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
just a guess right right they're
 
06:12:57.590 --> 06:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
projecting based on past experience this
 
06:12:59.150 --> 06:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
is how many people will collect abundant
 
06:13:00.410 --> 06:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
and benefit in the future and then
 
06:13:02.810 --> 06:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
you're taking all inflation increases in
 
06:13:04.610 --> 06:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
compensation and the increase in the
 
06:13:05.868 --> 06:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
benefit and say Here's what those future
 
06:13:07.548 --> 06:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
benefits will cost
 
06:13:09.708 --> 06:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
and that's what the increase you know
 
06:13:11.570 --> 06:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
the compare it to current law and new
 
06:13:14.590 --> 06:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
law can ask representative
 
06:13:17.510 --> 06:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes so representative Brewery
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
is there any what's what justifies
 
06:13:24.410 --> 06:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
um giving this benefit not to group one
 
06:13:32.990 --> 06:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:34.788 --> 06:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
you know we were looking at the group
 
06:13:37.310 --> 06:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
tools are like four or five years ago
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
and found this unit and I don't know
 
06:13:43.128 --> 06:13:43.138 align:start position:0%
what would one gets he says it looks
 
06:13:44.390 --> 06:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
like it's the same
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
06:13:49.010 --> 06:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
um I don't think too many people in
 
06:13:50.448 --> 06:13:50.458 align:start position:0%
group one get
 
06:13:53.628 --> 06:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
fatally injured for one thing I mean he
 
06:13:53.638 --> 06:13:54.850 align:start position:0%
fatally injured for one thing I mean he
mentioned

06:13:54.850 --> 06:13:54.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
06:13:58.730 --> 06:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
well dot is one but I I mean also you're
 
06:14:00.590 --> 06:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
covering police will carry guns and
 
06:14:02.330 --> 06:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
shoot at people and people shoot back at
 
06:14:04.128 --> 06:14:04.138 align:start position:0%
them and firefighters will go into
 
06:14:06.770 --> 06:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
burning buildings and you know the
 
06:14:06.780 --> 06:14:08.090 align:start position:0%
burning buildings and you know the
saving

06:14:08.090 --> 06:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
saving
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
you know they respond to everything uh
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
accidents and drug related stuff I mean
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
they get a rotten job
 
06:14:16.850 --> 06:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
they got a real rotten job I don't know
 
06:14:19.368 --> 06:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
anybody in group two any any firefighter
 
06:14:21.530 --> 06:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
or police officer that gets up and says
 
06:14:23.030 --> 06:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have a nice day at work
 
06:14:25.548 --> 06:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
today they have no chance they just
 
06:14:28.548 --> 06:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
don't have a chance thank you
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin followed by
 
06:14:34.010 --> 06:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler I mean I I guess
 
06:14:37.390 --> 06:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
my questions for the retirement system
 
06:14:40.430 --> 06:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm trying to grasp this and
 
06:14:41.810 --> 06:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
06:14:46.430 --> 06:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
so let's say I'm a Class 2 employee I
 
06:14:49.128 --> 06:14:49.138 align:start position:0%
have 10 years of service I'm working as
 
06:14:50.390 --> 06:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
a fireman
 
06:14:52.970 --> 06:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
I'm climbing up a building in the middle
 
06:14:55.128 --> 06:14:55.138 align:start position:0%
of a fire I fall off the ladder and I
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
get killed
 
06:14:56.400 --> 06:14:57.910 align:start position:0%
get killed
right

06:14:57.910 --> 06:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:15:00.530 --> 06:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
what's my benefit
 
06:15:02.948 --> 06:15:02.958 align:start position:0%
well your spouse would get happier
 
06:15:09.590 --> 06:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
the representative from the retirement
 
06:15:13.490 --> 06:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
system an opportunity to come up to
 
06:15:15.708 --> 06:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
answer that question yeah but I think
 
06:15:19.250 --> 06:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
that what it is you're lying
 
06:15:21.890 --> 06:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
so I'll repeat the question and I'm a
 
06:15:25.010 --> 06:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
firefighter 10 years on the job I go to
 
06:15:28.368 --> 06:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
a fire I fall off a ladder I get killed
 
06:15:31.910 --> 06:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
what's my benefit do I get is is this
 
06:15:34.610 --> 06:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
bill give me half my current salary or
 
06:15:37.070 --> 06:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would increase it from 50 to
 
06:15:38.590 --> 06:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
100 to yourself
 
06:15:41.930 --> 06:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
of your final years annual uh average
 
06:15:44.448 --> 06:15:44.458 align:start position:0%
I'm not sorry your final years earnable
 
06:15:46.670 --> 06:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
compensation whatever is reported to us
 
06:15:48.230 --> 06:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the 12 months prior to your death
 
06:15:50.810 --> 06:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay so basically what this Bill is
 
06:15:54.070 --> 06:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
saying is if a group two employee has
 
06:15:57.048 --> 06:15:57.058 align:start position:0%
dies on the job
 
06:16:00.650 --> 06:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
job related right he gets half his
 
06:16:02.690 --> 06:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
annuals I mean he gets a hundred percent
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
of his annual salary right it's taking
 
06:16:06.350 --> 06:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
current law and changing the benefit
 
06:16:09.770 --> 06:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
from 50 to 100 and how long does that go
 
06:16:09.780 --> 06:16:10.610 align:start position:0%
from 50 to 100 and how long does that go
on

06:16:10.610 --> 06:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:16:13.390 --> 06:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
so until you guys decide to change it
 
06:16:16.010 --> 06:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
again until you guys decide to change it
 
06:16:18.708 --> 06:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
again no I mean how long oh for the rest
 
06:16:21.770 --> 06:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
of her life um for the rest of her life
 
06:16:24.770 --> 06:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
the surviving spouse and if there is no
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse or the spouse dies and
 
06:16:28.368 --> 06:16:28.378 align:start position:0%
there are still children under 18.
 
06:16:31.010 --> 06:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
children under 18 and there's even an
 
06:16:33.170 --> 06:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
outlier that's never really happened if
 
06:16:34.850 --> 06:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
there was no spouse and no children but
 
06:16:36.590 --> 06:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
there were dependent parents they would
 
06:16:38.330 --> 06:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
get the annuity I don't think that's
 
06:16:39.948 --> 06:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
ever actually happened but it's in the
 
06:16:41.690 --> 06:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
statute and just to clarify one thing
 
06:16:43.730 --> 06:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
you said you you mentioned 10 years of
 
06:16:45.670 --> 06:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
service you don't need any
 
06:16:48.048 --> 06:16:48.058 align:start position:0%
could be one day yeah
 
06:16:51.788 --> 06:16:51.798 align:start position:0%
okay so so it just continues the salary
 
06:16:54.410 --> 06:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
as long as the spouses surviving
 
06:16:56.208 --> 06:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
children are alive well the difference
 
06:16:57.948 --> 06:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
being that there'd be no income tax on
 
06:17:01.010 --> 06:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
it the salary is taxed no X is not the
 
06:17:03.708 --> 06:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
benefit is not I have one other question
 
06:17:06.230 --> 06:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
if I die in the job what other benefits
 
06:17:08.590 --> 06:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
do I get is there a lump sum
 
06:17:11.448 --> 06:17:11.458 align:start position:0%
there is a state statute we do not
 
06:17:14.810 --> 06:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
administer for First Responders that has
 
06:17:16.670 --> 06:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
a death benefit I believe it's a hundred
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
thousand it has to be recommended by
 
06:17:19.440 --> 06:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
thousand it has to be recommended by
um

06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:24.288 --> 06:17:24.298 align:start position:0%
by the the person who uh their boss or
 
06:17:25.548 --> 06:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
whoever I think it's just state
 
06:17:27.470 --> 06:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
employees it has to be approved by the
 
06:17:29.510 --> 06:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
executive Council I think that's just
 
06:17:31.670 --> 06:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
state employees that's not our benefit
 
06:17:33.890 --> 06:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
there's also a federal benefit I'm not
 
06:17:36.288 --> 06:17:36.298 align:start position:0%
very familiar with it but the maximum
 
06:17:39.230 --> 06:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
benefits for over 400 000 but there's a
 
06:17:40.430 --> 06:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
lot of rules there so I don't want to
 
06:17:43.548 --> 06:17:43.558 align:start position:0%
opine on that I don't think anybody sure
 
06:17:46.670 --> 06:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it's more paper than real I think I
 
06:17:47.930 --> 06:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody in New Hampshire is
 
06:17:49.970 --> 06:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
on that yeah representative Griffin's
 
06:17:52.250 --> 06:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
gonna follow up yeah
 
06:17:52.260 --> 06:17:52.910 align:start position:0%
gonna follow up yeah
um

06:17:52.910 --> 06:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:56.810 --> 06:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:58.850 --> 06:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
well I'll hold it maybe it'll get
 
06:17:58.860 --> 06:18:00.590 align:start position:0%
well I'll hold it maybe it'll get
answered

06:18:00.590 --> 06:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
answered
 
06:18:02.930 --> 06:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:18:07.070 --> 06:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of decades ago representative
 
06:18:10.850 --> 06:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
Bernie ronowska was retired firemen
 
06:18:13.610 --> 06:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
he gave up part of his pension to have a
 
06:18:16.368 --> 06:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
survivor's Benefit Plan
 
06:18:18.708 --> 06:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
then his wife died before him
 
06:18:21.830 --> 06:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
he didn't get any money back and then we
 
06:18:24.530 --> 06:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
had a few a few years later firemen came
 
06:18:26.628 --> 06:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
in and said oh nobody can afford to give
 
06:18:28.490 --> 06:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
up that for the survivor's benefit plan
 
06:18:30.650 --> 06:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
we should get it without giving up
 
06:18:32.990 --> 06:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
anything and that was decided to do that
 
06:18:35.510 --> 06:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
that was a gift it was also part of the
 
06:18:38.510 --> 06:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
problem that we're now 5.7 billion in
 
06:18:40.730 --> 06:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
the hole in the retirement system this
 
06:18:43.010 --> 06:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
would make it a bigger hole and we we
 
06:18:44.570 --> 06:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
see these all the time when nobody's
 
06:18:47.270 --> 06:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
thinking ahead what can we do about the
 
06:18:49.490 --> 06:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
debt and the retirement system I don't
 
06:18:51.830 --> 06:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
want it to go bankrupt so everybody gets
 
06:18:53.090 --> 06:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
a fraction of what they think they're
 
06:18:54.770 --> 06:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
going to get but all these things you
 
06:18:56.030 --> 06:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
bring in
 
06:18:58.310 --> 06:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
are going to make the whole bigger
 
06:19:00.650 --> 06:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's my feeling
 
06:19:02.448 --> 06:19:02.458 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin has a question
 
06:19:05.810 --> 06:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
okay one one final one does this employ
 
06:19:07.390 --> 06:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
does this
 
06:19:10.970 --> 06:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
apply only to State Employees or does it
 
06:19:14.510 --> 06:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
lie to Municipal Employees also
 
06:19:17.530 --> 06:19:17.540 align:start position:0%
if the state retirement system this is
 
06:19:20.510 --> 06:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
the retirement system covers all public
 
06:19:20.520 --> 06:19:22.430 align:start position:0%
the retirement system covers all public
employees

06:19:22.430 --> 06:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
employees
 
06:19:25.250 --> 06:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
with one exception there are some
 
06:19:26.868 --> 06:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
people in Manchester will have their own
 
06:19:29.090 --> 06:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
plan non-police non-fire non-teachers
 
06:19:31.310 --> 06:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
have their own planual secretaries
 
06:19:31.320 --> 06:19:33.490 align:start position:0%
have their own planual secretaries
administrators

06:19:33.490 --> 06:19:33.500 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
06:19:36.110 --> 06:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
dpws everyone else if you work for the
 
06:19:38.208 --> 06:19:38.218 align:start position:0%
government you're in our plan this would
 
06:19:40.430 --> 06:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
cover group twos police and fire at both
 
06:19:42.890 --> 06:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
the political subdivision level and the
 
06:19:44.390 --> 06:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
state level which is State Police
 
06:19:47.150 --> 06:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
forestry and a few other agencies where
 
06:19:50.030 --> 06:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
there are certified police officers so
 
06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
would 21A
 
06:19:54.170 --> 06:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
apply to this
 
06:20:01.610 --> 06:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:03.410 --> 06:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
you can't interpret someone else's life
 
06:20:06.288 --> 06:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates from the state
 
06:20:06.298 --> 06:20:07.610 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates from the state
um

06:20:07.610 --> 06:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:11.048 --> 06:20:11.058 align:start position:0%
can't a pine on that
 
06:20:14.570 --> 06:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
a resident expert from the old Edna
 
06:20:14.580 --> 06:20:15.650 align:start position:0%
a resident expert from the old Edna
committee

06:20:15.650 --> 06:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:20:19.250 --> 06:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
no I just I believe the way the courts
 
06:20:19.260 --> 06:20:20.570 align:start position:0%
no I just I believe the way the courts
have

06:20:20.570 --> 06:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:20:24.948 --> 06:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
um have interpreted 28a is that if it's
 
06:20:28.070 --> 06:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
an if it's a change of type in an
 
06:20:31.430 --> 06:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing expense you know like like this
 
06:20:34.850 --> 06:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
one is it's okay if it's a brand new
 
06:20:38.890 --> 06:20:38.900 align:start position:0%
expense you know we just we we
 
06:20:42.410 --> 06:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
require nursery school or something then
 
06:20:45.350 --> 06:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a 28-day violation if you
 
06:20:47.570 --> 06:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
see what I mean but a change a detail
 
06:20:49.128 --> 06:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
change and something that's sort of
 
06:20:52.368 --> 06:20:52.378 align:start position:0%
ongoing is not so I think that's the way
 
06:20:53.628 --> 06:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
they interpreted
 
06:20:55.190 --> 06:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire
 
06:20:57.890 --> 06:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
06:20:59.868 --> 06:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
um addressed something that was said
 
06:20:59.878 --> 06:21:00.830 align:start position:0%
um addressed something that was said
earlier

06:21:00.830 --> 06:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:21:03.288 --> 06:21:03.298 align:start position:0%
I think it was back in the 90s and I
 
06:21:05.030 --> 06:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
can't remember what year when the
 
06:21:07.128 --> 06:21:07.138 align:start position:0%
retirement system was really robust
 
06:21:09.708 --> 06:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of money in the system
 
06:21:13.430 --> 06:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
the state we took a lot of money out of
 
06:21:14.628 --> 06:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
that system
 
06:21:16.910 --> 06:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
to help balance our budget and I'm not
 
06:21:18.948 --> 06:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
sure what year that was maybe somebody
 
06:21:24.048 --> 06:21:24.058 align:start position:0%
else would know I'll speak that was a
 
06:21:26.208 --> 06:21:26.218 align:start position:0%
and we never recovered from that
 
06:21:28.310 --> 06:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
well that was never
 
06:21:29.628 --> 06:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
um you're not allowed to do that the
 
06:21:31.368 --> 06:21:31.378 align:start position:0%
money's in of trust for the exclusive
 
06:21:32.990 --> 06:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
benefit and it would be a violation
 
06:21:35.628 --> 06:21:35.638 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty federal law and our state
 
06:21:37.070 --> 06:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
constitution to use the money for
 
06:21:39.470 --> 06:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
anything other than the benefits
 
06:21:43.788 --> 06:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
of for the members in the beneficiaries
 
06:21:46.970 --> 06:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
so I know way back we did take some Cola
 
06:21:49.128 --> 06:21:49.138 align:start position:0%
money out which was to benefit the
 
06:21:51.470 --> 06:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
beneficials you used money in our
 
06:21:53.288 --> 06:21:53.298 align:start position:0%
account to pay a cola to increase
 
06:21:56.990 --> 06:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
pensions for our members so it was for
 
06:21:59.330 --> 06:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
their benefit had a secondary benefit of
 
06:22:00.948 --> 06:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
not costing the state anything to pay
 
06:22:04.850 --> 06:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
for the cola but it was using planned
 
06:22:07.368 --> 06:22:07.378 align:start position:0%
funds to increase the benefit of plan
 
06:22:10.930 --> 06:22:10.940 align:start position:0%
members so that is legal right
 
06:22:14.810 --> 06:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay representative Sweeney
 
06:22:17.690 --> 06:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman at this time looking at
 
06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
this bill knowing the history with it's
 
06:22:22.548 --> 06:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
a policy that has passed the house and
 
06:22:25.788 --> 06:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
was supported by a sizable margin there
 
06:22:28.310 --> 06:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh knowing that we have other bills that
 
06:22:30.470 --> 06:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with that tackles parts of
 
06:22:32.990 --> 06:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability uh and this is
 
06:22:35.990 --> 06:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
really a key discussion in the budget I
 
06:22:38.090 --> 06:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
I think we should retain this
 
06:22:40.610 --> 06:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
legislation uh continue the conversation
 
06:22:43.010 --> 06:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
on what we're doing with the retirement
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
system at large but we have a lot of
 
06:22:47.930 --> 06:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
moving pieces here so I would make the
 
06:22:50.330 --> 06:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
06:22:51.948 --> 06:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
the moisture has been made by
 
06:22:53.690 --> 06:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney second by
 
06:22:53.700 --> 06:22:55.208 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney second by
representative

06:22:55.208 --> 06:22:55.218 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:22:59.750 --> 06:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
camberells is there any more discussion
 
06:23:02.810 --> 06:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none since it's a retained motion
 
06:23:04.670 --> 06:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
just a show of hands if everyone's okay
 
06:23:06.948 --> 06:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
with that
 
06:23:10.310 --> 06:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's unanimous thanks
 
06:35:21.890 --> 06:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:21.900 --> 06:35:29.948 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:35:29.948 --> 06:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:34.430 --> 06:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
the work session on House Bill 4th 36
 
06:35:37.368 --> 06:35:37.378 align:start position:0%
relative to group 2 retirement under
 
06:35:40.010 --> 06:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
transition Provisions in the retirement
 
06:35:40.020 --> 06:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
transition Provisions in the retirement
system

06:35:41.990 --> 06:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:35:43.970 --> 06:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
is that representative Pratt standing up
 
06:35:45.590 --> 06:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
back there
 
06:35:48.708 --> 06:35:48.718 align:start position:0%

06:35:54.298 --> 06:36:00.650 align:start position:0%
us how this is made it this far I sure
do

06:36:00.650 --> 06:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:04.430 --> 06:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
passed with Amendment 16-3 with the
 
06:36:06.350 --> 06:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
Minority Report being inexpedient to
 
06:36:08.628 --> 06:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
legislate it then went to the house
 
06:36:10.490 --> 06:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
floor with ought to pass with Amendment
 
06:36:16.190 --> 06:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:19.310 --> 06:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
thanks Melissa
 
06:36:23.090 --> 06:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt how are you good
 
06:36:25.010 --> 06:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
that takes care of my first line I was
 
06:36:27.770 --> 06:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:29.570 --> 06:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
it came out very strongly
 
06:36:31.850 --> 06:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a retirement Bill a lot
 
06:36:34.190 --> 06:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
of you here know the history of this it
 
06:36:36.350 --> 06:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
goes back to fixing some of the changes
 
06:36:38.750 --> 06:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
that were made in 2011.
 
06:36:44.208 --> 06:36:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:45.708 --> 06:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
06:36:48.350 --> 06:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
further spreads out the chart which
 
06:36:50.288 --> 06:36:50.298 align:start position:0%
we'll explain later on
 
06:36:52.850 --> 06:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
instead of being five different levels
 
06:36:54.530 --> 06:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
it's making it out into a nine different
 
06:36:58.250 --> 06:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
levels to further spread it out there
 
06:37:01.930 --> 06:37:01.940 align:start position:0%
will be basically a tier a b and c now
 
06:37:04.430 --> 06:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
and basically because of the year of
 
06:37:06.830 --> 06:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
their Style
 
06:37:08.930 --> 06:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
you have a uh a thing from the New
 
06:37:10.128 --> 06:37:10.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system that
 
06:37:12.590 --> 06:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
explains the cost of it
 
06:37:14.510 --> 06:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
or an estimated cost
 
06:37:16.910 --> 06:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
and it gives you a good background here
 
06:37:19.190 --> 06:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
in 2011 major changes was made to the
 
06:37:21.708 --> 06:37:21.718 align:start position:0%
retirement system so it was
 
06:37:23.448 --> 06:37:23.458 align:start position:0%
retroactively after the people already
 
06:37:25.670 --> 06:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
hired some of them had been working for
 
06:37:27.110 --> 06:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
quite a few years at that point up to
 
06:37:29.810 --> 06:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
nine years and the change the benefits
 
06:37:32.090 --> 06:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
would change to what they were hired for
 
06:37:33.890 --> 06:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
I had hired some of those people years
 
06:37:38.030 --> 06:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
ago I was a fireman for 28 years this
 
06:37:39.530 --> 06:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect me but it does affect
 
06:37:42.770 --> 06:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
about eight people I hired
 
06:37:46.490 --> 06:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh so this is a group two firemen
 
06:37:49.190 --> 06:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
policemen and guide spill uh does a
 
06:37:51.650 --> 06:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
little bit with group one and basically
 
06:37:54.048 --> 06:37:54.058 align:start position:0%
because of the cap on their glue point
 
06:37:55.670 --> 06:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
is included
 
06:37:58.430 --> 06:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
the average there will be a cap still
 
06:38:01.548 --> 06:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
remaining on this there was a 5 000 wood
 
06:38:04.310 --> 06:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
amendment made to the original bill so
 
06:38:07.430 --> 06:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh in that Amendment we came to retained
 
06:38:09.530 --> 06:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
the cap so there was no way that they
 
06:38:11.330 --> 06:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
can anybody can make more than 125
 
06:38:11.340 --> 06:38:12.288 align:start position:0%
can anybody can make more than 125
percent

06:38:12.288 --> 06:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:38:14.208 --> 06:38:14.218 align:start position:0%
that was one of the major concerns back
 
06:38:17.448 --> 06:38:17.458 align:start position:0%
in 2011 I believe so that's a good cap
 
06:38:20.150 --> 06:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
and now this doesn't totally restore
 
06:38:22.970 --> 06:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
everything that was done in 2011. it's
 
06:38:25.070 --> 06:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
very conservative we went on the
 
06:38:26.628 --> 06:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
conservative side as far as trying to
 
06:38:28.490 --> 06:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
draw this up but we're trying to fix
 
06:38:30.948 --> 06:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
some of those things uh right today I've
 
06:38:32.270 --> 06:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
heard of three guys that are retiring
 
06:38:34.670 --> 06:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
today so uh those some of these people
 
06:38:36.590 --> 06:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
are right at the point that they're
 
06:38:38.510 --> 06:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
retiring this is very timely it's a
 
06:38:40.190 --> 06:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
really a good time to be doing this
 
06:38:43.788 --> 06:38:43.798 align:start position:0%
because uh 2011 and now uh if you have
 
06:38:46.670 --> 06:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
23 to 24 years and you can retire so
 
06:38:47.930 --> 06:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
some of these people come and do right
 
06:38:49.670 --> 06:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
now so
 
06:38:53.150 --> 06:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh it'll do a few things
 
06:38:55.850 --> 06:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
retention is one of them how the the
 
06:38:58.490 --> 06:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
date that it starts is a few years out a
 
06:39:00.708 --> 06:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
couple years out so by doing it a couple
 
06:39:02.510 --> 06:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
years out we're hoping that will retain
 
06:39:03.948 --> 06:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
a good number of people that would be
 
06:39:05.510 --> 06:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
leaving right now they would stay
 
06:39:07.610 --> 06:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
another one to two years or three years
 
06:39:09.830 --> 06:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
in order to get the full band of the
 
06:39:11.208 --> 06:39:11.218 align:start position:0%
better benefit
 
06:39:16.970 --> 06:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
so um and then as far as uh recruitment
 
06:39:19.190 --> 06:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of concerns that the
 
06:39:20.510 --> 06:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
benefits were changed after a person
 
06:39:22.850 --> 06:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
could be hired so that scared a lot of
 
06:39:24.410 --> 06:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
people about coming into a system that
 
06:39:25.670 --> 06:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
could be changed after they're already
 
06:39:27.948 --> 06:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
hired so this right here says that no
 
06:39:29.448 --> 06:39:29.458 align:start position:0%
changes are made for three years after
 
06:39:31.368 --> 06:39:31.378 align:start position:0%
the Hyatt so that's a little bit of
 
06:39:33.770 --> 06:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
security and a lot of people feel I
 
06:39:34.850 --> 06:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
think this will help a lot of people
 
06:39:37.070 --> 06:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
feel a lot more secure with the system
 
06:39:39.590 --> 06:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
and not be so concerned about everything
 
06:39:41.270 --> 06:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
changed and after you've worked nine
 
06:39:41.280 --> 06:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
changed and after you've worked nine
years

06:39:41.990 --> 06:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:39:44.090 --> 06:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
so it's a little security thing in here
 
06:39:45.890 --> 06:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
so that's a good thing and that will
 
06:39:48.048 --> 06:39:48.058 align:start position:0%
also help I think in uh bringing new
 
06:39:50.270 --> 06:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
people in and I don't have to go into
 
06:39:52.190 --> 06:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers but uh we have a lot of
 
06:39:54.530 --> 06:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
shortages in the fire service right now
 
06:39:57.110 --> 06:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
how to get people like we used to for 18
 
06:39:58.788 --> 06:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
years I was commissioner fire standards
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
in training we used to do uh testing
 
06:40:02.750 --> 06:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
over there we'd have 300 people come to
 
06:40:04.430 --> 06:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
a test and now they have like 30 come to
 
06:40:06.890 --> 06:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
a test so it's um State Police are
 
06:40:08.930 --> 06:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
advertising on TV they used to have two
 
06:40:10.368 --> 06:40:10.378 align:start position:0%
or three hundred people waiting to get
 
06:40:11.868 --> 06:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
into State Police all policemen that
 
06:40:13.850 --> 06:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
wanted to become State Police and and
 
06:40:15.650 --> 06:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
now they're advertising on TV to try to
 
06:40:17.810 --> 06:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
get people so the shortages in all
 
06:40:19.190 --> 06:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
fields and I I don't know if you heard
 
06:40:21.410 --> 06:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
any testimony from the gods the gods are
 
06:40:23.208 --> 06:40:23.218 align:start position:0%
down 40 percent and they're making
 
06:40:25.070 --> 06:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
people work overtime which is also a big
 
06:40:27.230 --> 06:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
cost everybody's working overtime lots
 
06:40:30.350 --> 06:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
of overtime and that's expensive so
 
06:40:32.090 --> 06:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot of money but it's also
 
06:40:33.830 --> 06:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
very conservative what we've put
 
06:40:35.330 --> 06:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
together here Steve can go into the
 
06:40:37.850 --> 06:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
details Steve has a lot a lot to do this
 
06:40:40.190 --> 06:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
DPS in from Manchester
 
06:40:42.708 --> 06:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
and uh so if you get into questions you
 
06:40:45.890 --> 06:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:47.628 --> 06:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate your I know we all
 
06:40:49.670 --> 06:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate your efforts on this I try to
 
06:40:54.350 --> 06:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
correct some of the issues back in 2011.
 
06:40:56.150 --> 06:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's a goal
 
06:40:56.160 --> 06:40:56.930 align:start position:0%
that's a goal
um

06:40:56.930 --> 06:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:58.670 --> 06:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
I know are there any questions for
 
06:41:00.590 --> 06:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
06:41:03.110 --> 06:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
must have done an excellent job oh yes
 
06:41:06.430 --> 06:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for your presentation

I'm Representative Steve Pearce in
 
06:41:20.930 --> 06:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 13 which encompasses
 
06:41:22.730 --> 06:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
Dairy I'm an active member of the New
 
06:41:25.628 --> 06:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Retirement System
 
06:41:28.910 --> 06:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation in front of you was a
 
06:41:32.868 --> 06:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort that involved
 
06:41:32.878 --> 06:41:33.708 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort that involved
um

06:41:33.708 --> 06:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:36.650 --> 06:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
six different members of the House
 
06:41:38.690 --> 06:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
in its initial form
 
06:41:38.700 --> 06:41:40.850 align:start position:0%
in its initial form
and

06:41:40.850 --> 06:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:43.430 --> 06:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
all of the stakeholders that would be
 
06:41:45.708 --> 06:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
covered under this
 
06:41:45.718 --> 06:41:48.048 align:start position:0%
covered under this
plan

06:41:48.048 --> 06:41:48.058 align:start position:0%
plan
 
06:41:51.890 --> 06:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
on January 11th I was summoned to the
 
06:41:53.810 --> 06:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
speaker's office
 
06:41:56.570 --> 06:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
which frankly should scare the hell out
 
06:41:58.970 --> 06:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
of you it certainly did to me
 
06:41:58.980 --> 06:42:01.970 align:start position:0%
of you it certainly did to me
um

06:42:01.970 --> 06:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:03.410 --> 06:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
because I didn't know what I was walking
 
06:42:03.420 --> 06:42:04.368 align:start position:0%
because I didn't know what I was walking
into

06:42:04.368 --> 06:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
into
 
06:42:08.990 --> 06:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
and what I walked into was a request to
 
06:42:11.810 --> 06:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
fix this problem
 
06:42:14.208 --> 06:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Carol Maguire
 
06:42:15.948 --> 06:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
representative Simon both chair and vice
 
06:42:18.350 --> 06:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
chair of Edna myself
 
06:42:21.770 --> 06:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
um the leadership team of the house the
 
06:42:24.170 --> 06:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus of the house uh we're
 
06:42:26.750 --> 06:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
in the room we went over the problem and
 
06:42:28.850 --> 06:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
the speaker flat out asked me can I fix
 
06:42:28.860 --> 06:42:30.650 align:start position:0%
the speaker flat out asked me can I fix
this

06:42:30.650 --> 06:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:42:32.090 --> 06:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
and I told him I could because that's
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
what you tell the speaker when he asks
 
06:42:35.628 --> 06:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
you a question like that
 
06:42:38.330 --> 06:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
so it took three weeks of work to come
 
06:42:41.208 --> 06:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
up with a way to do this that that did
 
06:42:43.730 --> 06:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
two things one
 
06:42:46.910 --> 06:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
that it solved for the most part the
 
06:42:48.830 --> 06:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
damage or repaired the damage that had
 
06:42:52.250 --> 06:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
been done in 2011 but also did so in a
 
06:42:56.270 --> 06:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
manner that protected the system of in
 
06:42:59.270 --> 06:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
and of itself because damaging the
 
06:43:01.730 --> 06:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
retirement system is not in the best
 
06:43:03.350 --> 06:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
interest of any of us
 
06:43:05.570 --> 06:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
whether you're in the system or not
 
06:43:05.580 --> 06:43:07.128 align:start position:0%
whether you're in the system or not
so

06:43:07.128 --> 06:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:10.788 --> 06:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
a preliminary draft was was uh was
 
06:43:12.830 --> 06:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
created it was presented
 
06:43:18.170 --> 06:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
to Edna and Edna Begin work sessions on
 
06:43:21.170 --> 06:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
the particulars of this
 
06:43:24.530 --> 06:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
the form that 436 has now is voted on by
 
06:43:25.548 --> 06:43:25.558 align:start position:0%
the house
 
06:43:28.310 --> 06:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
was was written by representative Pratt
 
06:43:30.590 --> 06:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
myself representative Carol McGuire and
 
06:43:32.810 --> 06:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
06:43:34.548 --> 06:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
that is the language that's in front of
 
06:43:36.770 --> 06:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
you today
 
06:43:39.288 --> 06:43:39.298 align:start position:0%
I am
 
06:43:42.708 --> 06:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
not going to repeat my testimony in
 
06:43:44.690 --> 06:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
explanation of this in Edna because it
 
06:43:46.730 --> 06:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
took an hour and 15 minutes
 
06:43:49.548 --> 06:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
but I can I'm I can certainly go through
 
06:43:52.548 --> 06:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
it the cliff notes of of this and I'm
 
06:43:54.650 --> 06:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
more than happy to answer questions
 
06:43:56.868 --> 06:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
one of the things that happened as we
 
06:43:59.030 --> 06:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
look at the very beginning on line five
 
06:44:01.730 --> 06:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
from a 2011 Merrimack Superior Court
 
06:44:01.740 --> 06:44:03.708 align:start position:0%
from a 2011 Merrimack Superior Court
lawsuit

06:44:03.708 --> 06:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
06:44:06.770 --> 06:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
was a request by a judge to come up with
 
06:44:08.868 --> 06:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
a definition of vested because New
 
06:44:10.390 --> 06:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Statute
 
06:44:13.368 --> 06:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
ironically doesn't Define it there's a
 
06:44:14.750 --> 06:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
presumption that the retirement system
 
06:44:16.970 --> 06:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
has used for years that the
 
06:44:18.890 --> 06:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
qualifications of benefit occur at 10
 
06:44:20.990 --> 06:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
years and the presumption was that's
 
06:44:22.730 --> 06:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
when you were vested
 
06:44:24.530 --> 06:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
but there's never actually been a
 
06:44:26.270 --> 06:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
definition in statute
 
06:44:28.128 --> 06:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
I don't know why it took us
 
06:44:30.650 --> 06:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
12 years to come up with this it
 
06:44:31.788 --> 06:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have honestly should have been
 
06:44:33.350 --> 06:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
handled at the time but
 
06:44:34.970 --> 06:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
it's never the wrong time to do the
 
06:44:38.868 --> 06:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:41.750 --> 06:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
the the 10 years which is how the
 
06:44:43.310 --> 06:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
calculations of the pension system are
 
06:44:45.470 --> 06:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
based right now was was retained despite
 
06:44:46.970 --> 06:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
the fact that four of the six New
 
06:44:49.070 --> 06:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
England states and New York vested five
 
06:44:49.080 --> 06:44:51.048 align:start position:0%
England states and New York vested five
years

06:44:51.048 --> 06:44:51.058 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:44:52.670 --> 06:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
this is what the presumption has been
 
06:44:55.128 --> 06:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
this is what the faction the financials
 
06:44:58.010 --> 06:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
are based on a 10-year length of service
 
06:45:00.708 --> 06:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
to qualify for a benefit and we thought
 
06:45:02.448 --> 06:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
it would be too disruptive to modify
 
06:45:02.458 --> 06:45:03.650 align:start position:0%
it would be too disruptive to modify
that

06:45:03.650 --> 06:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:05.868 --> 06:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
now one of the things that was added
 
06:45:09.048 --> 06:45:09.058 align:start position:0%
here is two specific areas of Statute
 
06:45:11.448 --> 06:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
that get that can't be reduced after
 
06:45:13.610 --> 06:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
three years of service and that is just
 
06:45:15.830 --> 06:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
basically what a year is worth to you
 
06:45:20.090 --> 06:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
and what they include to figure out how
 
06:45:23.090 --> 06:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
your retirement is calculated
 
06:45:25.128 --> 06:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
that was done as a reputation fix
 
06:45:26.690 --> 06:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
because frankly right now the state of
 
06:45:28.250 --> 06:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the New England area
 
06:45:30.170 --> 06:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
has an absolutely horrible reputation in
 
06:45:31.970 --> 06:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
emergency services
 
06:45:33.890 --> 06:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's basically stated that the state of
 
06:45:36.650 --> 06:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cannot be trusted
 
06:45:39.170 --> 06:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
so that was done as a way to try to mend
 
06:45:41.570 --> 06:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
some of that keep in mind that there are
 
06:45:43.490 --> 06:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
other things that are not included in
 
06:45:46.128 --> 06:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
this that can be modified this is just
 
06:45:48.410 --> 06:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
the two biggest areas that the
 
06:45:51.830 --> 06:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were most concerned about
 
06:45:54.590 --> 06:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
in the event that we have a situation
 
06:45:57.470 --> 06:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
that does warrant modification there are
 
06:45:59.750 --> 06:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
other elements and again this is statute
 
06:46:03.170 --> 06:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
it's not constitutional law this can in
 
06:46:06.110 --> 06:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
the event of a catastrophe there's a lot
 
06:46:07.788 --> 06:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
of things that could be changed I will
 
06:46:09.170 --> 06:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
remind a finance committee that the
 
06:46:10.970 --> 06:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
pension system does have 11 billion
 
06:46:13.250 --> 06:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
dollars in assets right now
 
06:46:15.530 --> 06:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
they are we are not in a crisis level by
 
06:46:17.448 --> 06:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
any stretch of the imagination
 
06:46:19.368 --> 06:46:19.378 align:start position:0%
it's the highest actual level of
 
06:46:20.690 --> 06:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
Holdings that the pension system has
 
06:46:23.868 --> 06:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:26.330 --> 06:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
that is policy area policy I suppose
 
06:46:28.788 --> 06:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
number one is the is the part of that
 
06:46:30.230 --> 06:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
when you get into the next few
 
06:46:30.240 --> 06:46:31.610 align:start position:0%
when you get into the next few
paragraphs

06:46:31.610 --> 06:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
06:46:33.530 --> 06:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
what happened was in order to process
 
06:46:35.390 --> 06:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
this we had to separate group one and
 
06:46:38.270 --> 06:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
group two in into separate paragraphs
 
06:46:40.070 --> 06:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
since we were making a change specific
 
06:46:42.708 --> 06:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
to the way group two is is looked at
 
06:46:44.690 --> 06:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
versus group one
 
06:46:47.570 --> 06:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
so what that does is it basically just
 
06:46:50.150 --> 06:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
splits the groups up in statute instead
 
06:46:51.830 --> 06:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
of having paragraphs where the two
 
06:46:54.890 --> 06:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:58.190 --> 06:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
as an example on the top of page two
 
06:47:00.770 --> 06:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
lines two and three permanent firemen
 
06:47:02.030 --> 06:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
and policemen were removed because
 
06:47:03.890 --> 06:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
they're not in group one
 
06:47:06.708 --> 06:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
as in subsequently in the in the group
 
06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
two paragraphs this the areas in
 
06:47:11.690 --> 06:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
reference to the teachers and the state
 
06:47:13.610 --> 06:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh University system not included
 
06:47:15.350 --> 06:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
because they're not group two that's
 
06:47:17.208 --> 06:47:17.218 align:start position:0%
just that's just language cleanup to
 
06:47:19.448 --> 06:47:19.458 align:start position:0%
make sure that the two groups
 
06:47:23.030 --> 06:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
definitions are properly defined and
 
06:47:24.288 --> 06:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
that was run through the New Hampshire
 
06:47:25.850 --> 06:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
retirement system to make sure that that
 
06:47:28.670 --> 06:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:31.310 --> 06:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
the reason line 26 and 27 were removed
 
06:47:34.850 --> 06:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
from page two was because
 
06:47:37.850 --> 06:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
in a very bizarre manner the law said
 
06:47:37.860 --> 06:47:39.048 align:start position:0%
in a very bizarre manner the law said
hey

06:47:39.048 --> 06:47:39.058 align:start position:0%
hey
 
06:47:41.868 --> 06:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
do what's in paragraph 13. well
 
06:47:43.490 --> 06:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph 13 already tells you to do
 
06:47:45.288 --> 06:47:45.298 align:start position:0%
what's in paragraph 13. So it seemed
 
06:47:47.150 --> 06:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
kind of weird that you would have a
 
06:47:48.650 --> 06:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
second place to tell you to do something
 
06:47:50.868 --> 06:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
in another paragraph when that paragraph
 
06:47:52.310 --> 06:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
already tells you to do it so that was
 
06:47:55.070 --> 06:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
struck out and has no effect
 
06:47:57.410 --> 06:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
is in change in any way it's just a
 
06:47:58.730 --> 06:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
language cleanup
 
06:48:01.730 --> 06:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
page three covers like I said the change
 
06:48:03.530 --> 06:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
of splitting group one and group two
 
06:48:06.170 --> 06:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
into two separate groups
 
06:48:06.180 --> 06:48:06.830 align:start position:0%
into two separate groups
um

06:48:06.830 --> 06:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:09.230 --> 06:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's why it's in bold
 
06:48:12.350 --> 06:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
is because of the split
 
06:48:14.750 --> 06:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
when you when you get to page four under
 
06:48:16.670 --> 06:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
average final compensation the same
 
06:48:18.948 --> 06:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
thing had to happen group one and group
 
06:48:21.110 --> 06:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
two had to be split
 
06:48:24.288 --> 06:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
and that does the same thing
 
06:48:26.390 --> 06:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
where there may be the appearance of a
 
06:48:30.650 --> 06:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
policy change page five line item 32
 
06:48:33.048 --> 06:48:33.058 align:start position:0%
that the line that was struck out was
 
06:48:35.810 --> 06:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
done because it is impossible
 
06:48:39.530 --> 06:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
to be vested six months into your career
 
06:48:39.540 --> 06:48:41.048 align:start position:0%
to be vested six months into your career
under

06:48:41.048 --> 06:48:41.058 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
99.9 percent of examples
 
06:48:45.410 --> 06:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
the pension system was complicated
 
06:48:47.030 --> 06:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
enough this was just a matter that was
 
06:48:50.868 --> 06:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
done to make things a little bit simpler
 
06:48:53.810 --> 06:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
which which is ironic but yeah
 
06:48:55.730 --> 06:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
on a on a book that has its own
 
06:48:55.740 --> 06:49:00.830 align:start position:0%
on a on a book that has its own
publication

06:49:00.830 --> 06:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:04.910 --> 06:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
so getting into what the bill does
 
06:49:06.590 --> 06:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
when we get to page seven as
 
06:49:08.270 --> 06:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt stated the the
 
06:49:11.090 --> 06:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
chart the exploding of the chart from
 
06:49:13.850 --> 06:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
the four categories into nine has no
 
06:49:15.650 --> 06:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
substantive change all we did was
 
06:49:17.510 --> 06:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
separate them into one year blocks
 
06:49:20.570 --> 06:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
instead of two-year blocks or in the
 
06:49:22.548 --> 06:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
case of less than four years a four-year
 
06:49:22.558 --> 06:49:23.448 align:start position:0%
case of less than four years a four-year
block

06:49:23.448 --> 06:49:23.458 align:start position:0%
block
 
06:49:25.490 --> 06:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
this was necessary
 
06:49:27.770 --> 06:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
to separate them into one-year sections
 
06:49:31.128 --> 06:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
in order to affect an annual change if
 
06:49:33.048 --> 06:49:33.058 align:start position:0%
we had not done that you would have
 
06:49:36.110 --> 06:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
groups of people that would be some
 
06:49:38.628 --> 06:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
would be required to do one thing and
 
06:49:40.310 --> 06:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
others would be asked to do more this
 
06:49:46.430 --> 06:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:49.910 --> 06:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
but the minimum years of service minimum
 
06:49:53.570 --> 06:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
age and annual multiplier are identical
 
06:50:01.810 --> 06:50:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:05.690 --> 06:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
the when we what's that yep when we get
 
06:50:08.750 --> 06:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
into page eight one of the one of the
 
06:50:12.048 --> 06:50:12.058 align:start position:0%
concessions that was that was agreed to
 
06:50:16.490 --> 06:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
by the stakeholders in order to prevent
 
06:50:18.530 --> 06:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
a problem that was occurring in the past
 
06:50:23.030 --> 06:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
was the pension cap was modified
 
06:50:25.670 --> 06:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
current statute institutes a pension cap
 
06:50:29.030 --> 06:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
in 2009 that's when it was enacted
 
06:50:32.830 --> 06:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
so there were some fears that by
 
06:50:35.090 --> 06:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
putting folks back to the conditions
 
06:50:36.530 --> 06:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
under which they were hired we would
 
06:50:38.090 --> 06:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
have a potential for someone to have
 
06:50:40.128 --> 06:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
what some refer to as a runaway pension
 
06:50:42.048 --> 06:50:42.058 align:start position:0%
or an excessive pension
 
06:50:44.628 --> 06:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
to prevent that from occurring the
 
06:50:45.948 --> 06:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
pension cap
 
06:50:49.788 --> 06:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
was moved backwards to July 1 of 0-1 so
 
06:50:51.530 --> 06:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
all the folks that are covered by this
 
06:50:56.030 --> 06:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:57.948 --> 06:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
and that way we don't have those
 
06:50:59.948 --> 06:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
conditions occurring
 
06:51:03.048 --> 06:51:03.058 align:start position:0%
we those of us that are stewards of this
 
06:51:03.058 --> 06:51:04.490 align:start position:0%
we those of us that are stewards of this
system

06:51:04.490 --> 06:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:51:07.968 --> 06:51:07.978 align:start position:0%
agree that having excessive
 
06:51:10.070 --> 06:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
what someone would look concerned you
 
06:51:11.990 --> 06:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
know consider outrageous pensions is
 
06:51:13.670 --> 06:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the system it doesn't
 
06:51:15.230 --> 06:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
look good for the public and the system
 
06:51:17.868 --> 06:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
frankly wasn't set up for it
 
06:51:20.030 --> 06:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that takes that whole concern off the
 
06:51:20.040 --> 06:51:22.070 align:start position:0%
so that takes that whole concern off the
table

06:51:22.070 --> 06:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
table
 
06:51:23.868 --> 06:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
the pension cap currently that was
 
06:51:27.708 --> 06:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
instituted in 2009 was set at 120 000 if
 
06:51:29.868 --> 06:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
you took a hundred and twenty thousand
 
06:51:32.930 --> 06:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
dollars in today's value it's 166
 
06:51:34.968 --> 06:51:34.978 align:start position:0%
thousand three six hundred and thirty
 
06:51:36.350 --> 06:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
eight dollars
 
06:51:39.530 --> 06:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
that also would be considered excessive
 
06:51:41.390 --> 06:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
so rather than put that into today's
 
06:51:41.400 --> 06:51:43.190 align:start position:0%
so rather than put that into today's
dollars

06:51:43.190 --> 06:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:51:45.650 --> 06:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
the thought process was that rather than
 
06:51:48.948 --> 06:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:52.910 --> 06:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
put in the ability for the cap to adjust
 
06:51:54.948 --> 06:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
itself annually
 
06:51:57.048 --> 06:51:57.058 align:start position:0%
now one and a quarter percent is going
 
06:52:00.350 --> 06:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
to probably never keep up with inflation
 
06:52:04.968 --> 06:52:04.978 align:start position:0%
but it does at least keep the cap from
 
06:52:07.310 --> 06:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
being a stagnant dollar
 
06:52:10.368 --> 06:52:10.378 align:start position:0%
it also allows the retirement system to
 
06:52:13.490 --> 06:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
have a fixed hard number of a cap to
 
06:52:16.610 --> 06:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
make projections moving forward
 
06:52:20.030 --> 06:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
rather than being based on some kind of
 
06:52:22.850 --> 06:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
tying to some sort of a CPI type of
 
06:52:24.350 --> 06:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
thing which you see in some other states
 
06:52:26.390 --> 06:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is just a hard number and they
 
06:52:29.030 --> 06:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
could pick a date out 30 years and say
 
06:52:30.770 --> 06:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay we know what the cap will be at
 
06:52:35.330 --> 06:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:37.368 --> 06:52:37.378 align:start position:0%
that is the that is where the one and a
 
06:52:38.930 --> 06:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
quarter percent comes from you earn two
 
06:52:40.490 --> 06:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
and a half percent per year of service
 
06:52:42.288 --> 06:52:42.298 align:start position:0%
the one and a quarter is just like I
 
06:52:44.270 --> 06:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
said to keep that moving the other thing
 
06:52:47.030 --> 06:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
is over time if you have a stagnant
 
06:52:49.968 --> 06:52:49.978 align:start position:0%
number you start to have a ceiling
 
06:52:53.090 --> 06:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
where 15 years from now let's say
 
06:52:55.788 --> 06:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
salaries change and and the value of the
 
06:52:58.190 --> 06:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
dollar changes you don't want to be in a
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
situation where your pension cap forces
 
06:53:03.530 --> 06:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
people to leave the longer someone works
 
06:53:05.868 --> 06:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
in the pension system the better it is
 
06:53:08.150 --> 06:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
for the system so we don't want to get
 
06:53:10.430 --> 06:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
in a situation where we tell people hey
 
06:53:12.590 --> 06:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
you hit the cap see you later
 
06:53:14.810 --> 06:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
we want to encourage people to work as
 
06:53:19.250 --> 06:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:21.650 --> 06:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
to give you an example of that the
 
06:53:23.208 --> 06:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
average roughly the average group two
 
06:53:25.190 --> 06:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
pensions and somewhere in the 40 45
 
06:53:26.990 --> 06:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
we'll use forty five thousand dollars I
 
06:53:28.850 --> 06:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
suppose is a round number
 
06:53:31.070 --> 06:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
so for every year you keep someone in
 
06:53:32.990 --> 06:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
the system that's forty five thousand
 
06:53:35.270 --> 06:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
dollars they're not withdrawing but
 
06:53:37.190 --> 06:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
they're putting in portions of their
 
06:53:40.010 --> 06:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
paycheck so it's a flip
 
06:53:41.448 --> 06:53:41.458 align:start position:0%
where you're adding to the system and
 
06:53:43.190 --> 06:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
not withdrawing that is why having
 
06:53:46.250 --> 06:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
someone work longer is better
 
06:53:48.368 --> 06:53:48.378 align:start position:0%
as representative Pratt stated
 
06:53:51.890 --> 06:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
understated we have a substantial labor
 
06:53:54.830 --> 06:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
problem in group two right now
 
06:53:58.310 --> 06:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
and as a as a long-standing commissioner
 
06:54:00.048 --> 06:54:00.058 align:start position:0%
he saw this
 
06:54:01.968 --> 06:54:01.978 align:start position:0%
from a global standpoint I'll give this
 
06:54:03.288 --> 06:54:03.298 align:start position:0%
to you from a city of Manchester
 
06:54:03.298 --> 06:54:04.610 align:start position:0%
to you from a city of Manchester
standpoint

06:54:04.610 --> 06:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
06:54:08.090 --> 06:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
I tested with 400 people 20 years ago
 
06:54:11.090 --> 06:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
for nine positions the current hiring
 
06:54:14.930 --> 06:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
list in the city of Manchester is zero
 
06:54:17.270 --> 06:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
zero we're taking people from other
 
06:54:17.280 --> 06:54:19.250 align:start position:0%
zero we're taking people from other
municipalities

06:54:19.250 --> 06:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:54:21.110 --> 06:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
that if you had told someone 20 years
 
06:54:22.310 --> 06:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
ago that that would be the case they
 
06:54:23.810 --> 06:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
would have laughed at you
 
06:54:25.968 --> 06:54:25.978 align:start position:0%
Corrections has 300 openings at the
 
06:54:27.708 --> 06:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
state right now
 
06:54:29.990 --> 06:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
State Police are advertising as far west
 
06:54:31.610 --> 06:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
as Ohio
 
06:54:33.770 --> 06:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
because we can't get people
 
06:54:37.430 --> 06:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
so part of that is a severe credibility
 
06:54:39.230 --> 06:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
problem with the state of New Hampshire
 
06:54:41.030 --> 06:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
and we just lost a guy in Manchester
 
06:54:42.708 --> 06:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
whose folks still live in the city and
 
06:54:45.110 --> 06:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
he's going to the Carolinas because what
 
06:54:47.990 --> 06:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
they have to offer down there is stable
 
06:54:48.000 --> 06:54:52.128 align:start position:0%
they have to offer down there is stable
so

06:54:52.128 --> 06:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:54.890 --> 06:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
this will begin the healing process if
 
06:54:56.990 --> 06:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
you will this does not Institute a new
 
06:54:59.030 --> 06:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
benefit this does not Institute anything
 
06:55:01.310 --> 06:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
for anyone that occurred after July 1 of
 
06:55:01.320 --> 06:55:02.510 align:start position:0%
for anyone that occurred after July 1 of
11.

06:55:02.510 --> 06:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
11.
 
06:55:05.150 --> 06:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
those folks were hired under the
 
06:55:06.410 --> 06:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
conditions that they currently are
 
06:55:08.090 --> 06:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
there's no surprises there nothing
 
06:55:11.150 --> 06:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
nothing was done retroactively to them
 
06:55:13.368 --> 06:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
I have a state trooper that had nine
 
06:55:15.230 --> 06:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
years 11 months and two weeks when this
 
06:55:16.788 --> 06:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
changes came on
 
06:55:20.990 --> 06:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
17 days away from from the difference
 
06:55:23.208 --> 06:55:23.218 align:start position:0%
between you know the article 23 the
 
06:55:25.670 --> 06:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
State Constitution clarifies and talks
 
06:55:28.070 --> 06:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
about retroactive lawmaking this is not
 
06:55:31.250 --> 06:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
rules this is not a private firm this is
 
06:55:33.708 --> 06:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
statute this is law there's a reason why
 
06:55:36.230 --> 06:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
the other 48 of the 50 states didn't go
 
06:55:37.910 --> 06:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
retroactive when they made their changes
 
06:55:41.690 --> 06:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
between 2010 and 2012. and the 49th
 
06:55:43.788 --> 06:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
state that did reverse their decision
 
06:55:46.250 --> 06:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
two years later we are the only state
 
06:55:48.468 --> 06:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
that went backwards
 
06:55:51.350 --> 06:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't have done it
 
06:55:54.230 --> 06:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
so this does not bring them back a
 
06:55:55.490 --> 06:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
hundred percent at all like I said
 
06:55:57.468 --> 06:55:57.478 align:start position:0%
there's another concession I didn't even
 
06:56:00.170 --> 06:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
touch on is the enaction date because I
 
06:56:01.910 --> 06:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
guess I didn't get to that point the
 
06:56:03.708 --> 06:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
inaction date if you look at the very
 
06:56:07.128 --> 06:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
end of this paragraph 17 that takes
 
06:56:09.770 --> 06:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
effect staggered annually that is done
 
06:56:12.350 --> 06:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
to force God the members of group two to
 
06:56:13.968 --> 06:56:13.978 align:start position:0%
work an additional year
 
06:56:16.250 --> 06:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
to gain this benefit
 
06:56:18.770 --> 06:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
that was a trade-off it was a trade-off
 
06:56:20.750 --> 06:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
the two trade-offs actually come to
 
06:56:23.330 --> 06:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
around 35 million dollars of value
 
06:56:25.070 --> 06:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's what was shaved off the original
 
06:56:28.430 --> 06:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
cost of this is roughly 35 million
 
06:56:31.730 --> 06:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:33.590 --> 06:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to leave
 
06:56:33.600 --> 06:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to leave
beforehand

06:56:35.030 --> 06:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
beforehand
 
06:56:37.548 --> 06:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
under the current math if they so choose
 
06:56:39.650 --> 06:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
but we are asking them to give an
 
06:56:41.570 --> 06:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
additional year of service to help with
 
06:56:43.548 --> 06:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
this labor problem because with them
 
06:56:46.310 --> 06:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
leaving I don't have anybody behind them
 
06:56:51.770 --> 06:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:54.288 --> 06:56:54.298 align:start position:0%
the as for those of you in Rockingham
 
06:56:56.150 --> 06:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
County that were at the
 
06:56:58.010 --> 06:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
last Rockingham County meeting the
 
06:57:00.948 --> 06:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
department of corrections there had a
 
06:57:04.310 --> 06:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
report that ranks the Department of
 
06:57:06.468 --> 06:57:06.478 align:start position:0%
Corrections in the 50 states based on
 
06:57:08.090 --> 06:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
salary working conditions pension
 
06:57:11.330 --> 06:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
benefits and and the like they rate
 
06:57:12.948 --> 06:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
they rate all 50 states New Hampshire
 
06:57:16.128 --> 06:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
finished dead last we are 50 of 50.
 
06:57:18.650 --> 06:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
that is not a badge of honor
 
06:57:22.368 --> 06:57:22.378 align:start position:0%
50 of 50. I I didn't realize that it was
 
06:57:24.830 --> 06:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
it was to that level but that's that's
 
06:57:27.410 --> 06:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
what the report said so the corrections
 
06:57:27.420 --> 06:57:29.090 align:start position:0%
what the report said so the corrections
folks

06:57:29.090 --> 06:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
folks
 
06:57:32.390 --> 06:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
um who are Beyond crisis mode this is a
 
06:57:35.208 --> 06:57:35.218 align:start position:0%
big deal to them right now
 
06:57:37.310 --> 06:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
now getting into the
 
06:57:39.590 --> 06:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
legalese part of this
 
06:57:42.350 --> 06:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
and the part that gets that made me not
 
06:57:45.048 --> 06:57:45.058 align:start position:0%
sleep for 22 days was starting in
 
06:57:47.628 --> 06:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
paragraph six which is page eight page
 
06:57:50.090 --> 06:57:50.100 align:start position:0%
nine and ten there's more Roman numerals
 
06:57:51.890 --> 06:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
here than a
 
06:57:55.490 --> 06:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
than a Roman Historic Site
 
06:57:58.250 --> 06:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
what that basically does
 
06:58:00.830 --> 06:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
is that is how this bill amends itself
 
06:58:00.840 --> 06:58:06.350 align:start position:0%
is that is how this bill amends itself
annually

06:58:06.350 --> 06:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:09.468 --> 06:58:09.478 align:start position:0%
because as we're asked as because as
 
06:58:11.810 --> 06:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to give the additional
 
06:58:15.170 --> 06:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
year we have to implement it
 
06:58:19.730 --> 06:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:23.990 --> 06:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:26.110 --> 06:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
I know it's terrifying looking
 
06:58:29.270 --> 06:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
but it's it's the same paragraph
 
06:58:32.628 --> 06:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
repeated nine times just with a date
 
06:58:32.638 --> 06:58:33.948 align:start position:0%
repeated nine times just with a date
change

06:58:33.948 --> 06:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
change
 
06:58:38.990 --> 06:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:41.690 --> 06:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
I was assured by OLS that this is not
 
06:58:43.250 --> 06:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
the only thing that they've ever passed
 
06:58:46.788 --> 06:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
that had that is self-amending I
 
06:58:49.368 --> 06:58:49.378 align:start position:0%
they've done it with other things
 
06:58:51.650 --> 06:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
um and they felt that this the way to do
 
06:58:54.110 --> 06:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
this prevents this from being a 92-page
 
06:58:54.120 --> 06:58:55.548 align:start position:0%
this prevents this from being a 92-page
bill

06:58:55.548 --> 06:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:58:58.910 --> 06:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
is just to do it in a sum up form like
 
06:58:58.920 --> 06:59:01.548 align:start position:0%
is just to do it in a sum up form like
that

06:59:01.548 --> 06:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:06.468 --> 06:59:06.478 align:start position:0%
so this past the house 282 to 80
 
06:59:08.628 --> 06:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
despite a speech that was given with an
 
06:59:12.350 --> 06:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
exorbitantly incorrect fiscal note
 
06:59:16.548 --> 06:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
so the the house has clearly established
 
06:59:18.770 --> 06:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
a position of policy on this this is
 
06:59:21.288 --> 06:59:21.298 align:start position:0%
something that's been looked at for six
 
06:59:22.610 --> 06:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
years now
 
06:59:25.128 --> 06:59:25.138 align:start position:0%
and it's time to just end this to fix it
 
06:59:31.310 --> 06:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:33.048 --> 06:59:33.058 align:start position:0%
thanks for your work representative
 
06:59:33.058 --> 06:59:35.090 align:start position:0%
thanks for your work representative
Pearson

06:59:35.090 --> 06:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
06:59:37.610 --> 06:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire question thank
 
06:59:39.830 --> 06:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
you and thank you representative you
 
06:59:42.530 --> 06:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
just impugned our LBA in saying that the
 
06:59:44.990 --> 06:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is incorrect In what way is
 
06:59:46.968 --> 06:59:46.978 align:start position:0%
it incorrect
 
06:59:50.448 --> 06:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
did I say that a little bit I'm just uh
 
06:59:52.250 --> 06:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal right really oh yeah
 
06:59:54.530 --> 06:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
so uh what happened was we we put in for
 
06:59:57.110 --> 06:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh a number to come from the
 
06:59:58.788 --> 06:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
retirement system and it took a long
 
07:00:00.230 --> 07:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
time to get it because of all the moving
 
07:00:02.690 --> 07:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
Parts here so uh it we didn't have a
 
07:00:04.670 --> 07:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
number going into the meetings we were
 
07:00:07.730 --> 07:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
having so we took another bill that did
 
07:00:09.490 --> 07:00:09.500 align:start position:0%
more than this building
 
07:00:12.590 --> 07:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
549. we use that Bill's number which was
 
07:00:16.310 --> 07:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh 125 million which was 250 million 250
 
07:00:19.610 --> 07:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
million wait 250 million so we use that
 
07:00:21.890 --> 07:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
number to uh actually give you an
 
07:00:23.750 --> 07:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
estimate of what it would cost this
 
07:00:25.610 --> 07:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't have as many benefits uh
 
07:00:27.288 --> 07:00:27.298 align:start position:0%
corrections as that one did that one
 
07:00:29.990 --> 07:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually also included um other people
 
07:00:31.788 --> 07:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
outside of this group it made no
 
07:00:33.468 --> 07:00:33.478 align:start position:0%
concessions of any kind no concessions
 
07:00:35.330 --> 07:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
so we made a lot of concessions in here
 
07:00:37.548 --> 07:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
and we did a lot of things to pare it
 
07:00:39.650 --> 07:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
down so that number was a lot higher
 
07:00:41.690 --> 07:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
than this number so they voted on it
 
07:00:43.490 --> 07:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
with this higher number with a number it
 
07:00:44.570 --> 07:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
was a lot higher than what it's actually
 
07:00:46.190 --> 07:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
07:00:48.110 --> 07:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
that that was not a mistake on lba's
 
07:00:50.628 --> 07:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
part that was that was on the mistake of
 
07:00:52.250 --> 07:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
a legislative speech
 
07:00:54.170 --> 07:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire followed by
 
07:00:58.310 --> 07:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin so does this bill
 
07:01:01.610 --> 07:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
not spend 25 million dollars of the
 
07:01:04.548 --> 07:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
general fund for 10 years
 
07:01:07.788 --> 07:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
it does it does okay so that is 250
 
07:01:10.310 --> 07:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars well
 
07:01:13.490 --> 07:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
and and in addition to that from the
 
07:01:16.670 --> 07:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions 13 million eight
 
07:01:19.250 --> 07:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty thousand I don't know
 
07:01:21.468 --> 07:01:21.478 align:start position:0%
I'd have to ask if that's a one-time or
 
07:01:24.890 --> 07:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
a or multiple times so when you
 
07:01:28.250 --> 07:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
when you do a payment like this the
 
07:01:29.510 --> 07:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
value of a dollar today is different
 
07:01:31.910 --> 07:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
than a value of a dollar tomorrow right
 
07:01:33.590 --> 07:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
so the retirement system takes those
 
07:01:35.510 --> 07:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
funds and invests those funds
 
07:01:37.968 --> 07:01:37.978 align:start position:0%
they have to give you a snapshot based
 
07:01:40.310 --> 07:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
on a presumed rate of return which they
 
07:01:42.708 --> 07:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
are using at six and three quarter
 
07:01:45.468 --> 07:01:45.478 align:start position:0%
by their own publication which we all
 
07:01:48.650 --> 07:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
get the average rate of return for 3 5
 
07:01:51.890 --> 07:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
10 and 25 years is seven one seven two
 
07:01:54.110 --> 07:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
eight five and six nine all of which are
 
07:01:55.788 --> 07:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
higher than the conservative rate of
 
07:01:59.330 --> 07:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
return they use right now so as this
 
07:01:59.340 --> 07:02:00.468 align:start position:0%
return they use right now so as this
bill

07:02:00.468 --> 07:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:02:04.368 --> 07:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
oh is enacted and moves forward you
 
07:02:08.208 --> 07:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
would have in two years a re-look at
 
07:02:10.430 --> 07:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
where you are if you have
 
07:02:12.110 --> 07:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
a substantially better rate of return
 
07:02:15.708 --> 07:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
like say we had in 2021 then that cost
 
07:02:17.868 --> 07:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
would go down and likewise
 
07:02:20.990 --> 07:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
but with a 3 5 10 and 25 year averages
 
07:02:24.770 --> 07:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
all above the conservative level here
 
07:02:27.830 --> 07:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
riding the Peaks and valleys
 
07:02:29.868 --> 07:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
their estimation of cost is an
 
07:02:31.730 --> 07:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
overestimate and it should be
 
07:02:34.490 --> 07:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
it should be but based on empirical data
 
07:02:37.548 --> 07:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
from from their own publication their
 
07:02:39.170 --> 07:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
meeting that goal has not been a problem
 
07:02:42.830 --> 07:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
over that time period
 
07:02:42.840 --> 07:02:43.730 align:start position:0%
over that time period
yeah

07:02:43.730 --> 07:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:02:47.150 --> 07:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
all right let's let's go on
 
07:02:47.160 --> 07:02:50.628 align:start position:0%
all right let's let's go on
um

07:02:50.628 --> 07:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:54.110 --> 07:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
isn't it so so this this bill benefits
 
07:02:57.948 --> 07:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
only those who are hired in 2011 and
 
07:03:01.010 --> 07:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
earlier correct from from July 1 of 01
 
07:03:04.010 --> 07:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
to July 1 of 11. it is a fixed number of
 
07:03:06.230 --> 07:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
people it cannot be increased it can
 
07:03:10.070 --> 07:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
only be reduced so those people even
 
07:03:12.830 --> 07:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
under current law have a superior
 
07:03:15.650 --> 07:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
pension to people who are hired
 
07:03:18.890 --> 07:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
subsequent to 2011 is that right it is
 
07:03:21.410 --> 07:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
because the legislature has the right to
 
07:03:24.650 --> 07:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
make changes to the pension system
 
07:03:28.788 --> 07:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
for folks that don't exist yet
 
07:03:31.128 --> 07:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
okay and the legislature chose to do so
 
07:03:33.948 --> 07:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
and and I and I will defend that
 
07:03:37.010 --> 07:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
okay but if the purpose of this is to
 
07:03:40.190 --> 07:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
improve hiring shouldn't we
 
07:03:43.690 --> 07:03:43.700 align:start position:0%
give extra benefits to people
 
07:03:46.788 --> 07:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
who will be hired as opposed to giving
 
07:03:49.910 --> 07:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
benefits to people who are hired between
 
07:03:54.410 --> 07:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
2001 and 2011. if if you hire someone
 
07:03:56.628 --> 07:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that has a benefit that someone
 
07:03:59.510 --> 07:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
with 15 years on what you will do
 
07:04:01.250 --> 07:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
socially to group two will be
 
07:04:01.260 --> 07:04:04.788 align:start position:0%
socially to group two will be
catastrophic

07:04:04.788 --> 07:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:06.830 --> 07:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
no but we've already said that the the
 
07:04:09.170 --> 07:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
15 years on people are better than
 
07:04:11.150 --> 07:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
today's people because they were hired
 
07:04:12.708 --> 07:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
under those conditions they knew that
 
07:04:15.468 --> 07:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
when they took the job
 
07:04:17.270 --> 07:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
these folks that were retroactively
 
07:04:19.010 --> 07:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
changed entered the profession under a
 
07:04:20.810 --> 07:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
different agreement under different
 
07:04:23.868 --> 07:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
conditions it made their decision for a
 
07:04:26.448 --> 07:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
career in the state of New Hampshire and
 
07:04:28.128 --> 07:04:28.138 align:start position:0%
their subsequent financial planning
 
07:04:30.170 --> 07:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
based on what was presented to them when
 
07:04:32.330 --> 07:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
they were hired if you were hired July
 
07:04:36.468 --> 07:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
2nd of of 2011 what you were presented
 
07:04:38.030 --> 07:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
the day you were hired is identical to
 
07:04:41.150 --> 07:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:44.208 --> 07:04:44.218 align:start position:0%
this this is this is fixing the fairness
 
07:04:46.070 --> 07:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
part of it what you're talking about is
 
07:04:49.010 --> 07:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
the people that comes after this they're
 
07:04:50.868 --> 07:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
getting less of a benefit that would
 
07:04:52.010 --> 07:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
have to be something that would help me
 
07:04:53.150 --> 07:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
look at at some point if you wanted to
 
07:04:54.350 --> 07:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
bring those people up to this level
 
07:04:56.030 --> 07:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
you'd have to convene the decennial
 
07:04:57.110 --> 07:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
commission it would have to be a
 
07:04:58.850 --> 07:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
separate a separate thing but I can
 
07:04:59.868 --> 07:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying is the
 
07:05:01.670 --> 07:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
people behind these people are not
 
07:05:02.930 --> 07:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
getting what these people getting but
 
07:05:04.968 --> 07:05:04.978 align:start position:0%
they were hired knowing that so that's
 
07:05:07.190 --> 07:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
why they're not included in this number
 
07:05:09.230 --> 07:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
there'd have to be another look at to do
 
07:05:11.690 --> 07:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
that group of people after before these
 
07:05:13.128 --> 07:05:13.138 align:start position:0%
people people came in after these people
 
07:05:15.230 --> 07:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
understand that's what I mean I think
 
07:05:15.240 --> 07:05:17.150 align:start position:0%
understand that's what I mean I think
yeah

07:05:17.150 --> 07:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:05:19.190 --> 07:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin please
 
07:05:22.670 --> 07:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
07:05:24.190 --> 07:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
07:05:27.708 --> 07:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
so in the last biennium
 
07:05:31.250 --> 07:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
we also had a bill addressing the same
 
07:05:34.570 --> 07:05:34.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:37.430 --> 07:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
High School 1587 in the last bienna
 
07:05:43.070 --> 07:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
addressed a portion of of this right so
 
07:05:46.910 --> 07:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
it was a part of it in in that
 
07:05:50.208 --> 07:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
um that fix in the appropriation that
 
07:05:52.490 --> 07:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
was done
 
07:05:54.410 --> 07:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
um to that
 
07:05:58.850 --> 07:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:01.490 --> 07:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is
 
07:06:03.530 --> 07:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say Final Solution
 
07:06:04.930 --> 07:06:04.940 align:start position:0%
there's some bad
 
07:06:08.868 --> 07:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
connotations to that but is is this the
 
07:06:11.990 --> 07:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
the final bill we see on this particular
 
07:06:13.788 --> 07:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
problem the the speaker was very clear
 
07:06:16.850 --> 07:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
to me when he when he said to fix it so
 
07:06:20.530 --> 07:06:20.540 align:start position:0%
fixing it means all the way and this is
 
07:06:23.150 --> 07:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
like I said with with this the
 
07:06:25.128 --> 07:06:25.138 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved with the folks
 
07:06:25.138 --> 07:06:25.910 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved with the folks
that

07:06:25.910 --> 07:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:06:29.510 --> 07:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
that needed to be at the table this this
 
07:06:31.968 --> 07:06:31.978 align:start position:0%
is considered the fix
 
07:06:33.830 --> 07:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
after the if this is implemented it's
 
07:06:33.840 --> 07:06:38.390 align:start position:0%
after the if this is implemented it's
done

07:06:38.390 --> 07:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:40.490 --> 07:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
for other questions representative
 
07:06:40.500 --> 07:06:42.048 align:start position:0%
for other questions representative
Weiler

07:06:42.048 --> 07:06:42.058 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
07:06:43.850 --> 07:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
07:06:44.990 --> 07:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and
 
07:06:45.000 --> 07:06:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and
representative

07:06:47.510 --> 07:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:47.520 --> 07:06:49.010 align:start position:0%
 
and

07:06:49.010 --> 07:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:06:49.020 --> 07:06:50.510 align:start position:0%
and
2011.

07:06:50.510 --> 07:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
2011.
 
07:06:54.110 --> 07:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
we had a two billion dollar hole
 
07:06:56.990 --> 07:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system they attempted
 
07:06:58.430 --> 07:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
to fix it
 
07:07:00.468 --> 07:07:00.478 align:start position:0%
virtually everything they tried has been
 
07:07:03.948 --> 07:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
undone since so now we have a 5.7
 
07:07:07.368 --> 07:07:07.378 align:start position:0%
billion dollar hole what does this do to
 
07:07:12.650 --> 07:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:16.610 --> 07:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
the percentage of unfunded liability of
 
07:07:19.010 --> 07:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
the pension system is far better now
 
07:07:22.250 --> 07:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
than it was then the pl we're at 66
 
07:07:22.260 --> 07:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
than it was then the pl we're at 66
percent

07:07:23.270 --> 07:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:07:25.910 --> 07:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
sure we are we have 11 billion over 11
 
07:07:28.190 --> 07:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
billion in assets right now which is the
 
07:07:30.830 --> 07:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
highest it's ever been
 
07:07:34.430 --> 07:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
the problem here is not to address the
 
07:07:37.610 --> 07:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
fix but it also does not touch upon what
 
07:07:39.310 --> 07:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
the decennial commission put forward
 
07:07:42.708 --> 07:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
with the plan to repair the unfunded
 
07:07:45.288 --> 07:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
liability which has now been enacted 11
 
07:07:48.650 --> 07:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
years and is working successfully
 
07:07:51.350 --> 07:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
my assessment of what you've done makes
 
07:07:52.968 --> 07:07:52.978 align:start position:0%
that hole bigger
 
07:07:55.190 --> 07:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
because you're increasing everybody's
 
07:07:55.200 --> 07:07:56.570 align:start position:0%
because you're increasing everybody's
compensation

07:07:56.570 --> 07:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
07:07:59.570 --> 07:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
you're increasing the contribution by
 
07:08:02.990 --> 07:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
the employer but not by the employee
 
07:08:06.288 --> 07:08:06.298 align:start position:0%
I think pain should be shared equally so
 
07:08:06.298 --> 07:08:08.810 align:start position:0%
I think pain should be shared equally so
the

07:08:08.810 --> 07:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:08:11.208 --> 07:08:11.218 align:start position:0%
employees contribution rate was
 
07:08:15.530 --> 07:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
increased in 2011 from 9-3 to almost 12.
 
07:08:19.190 --> 07:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
right with a reduction in benefit
 
07:08:21.468 --> 07:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
if you had done that increase and left
 
07:08:24.770 --> 07:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
things alone and grandfathered everybody
 
07:08:26.448 --> 07:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
I still think there would be folks that
 
07:08:28.128 --> 07:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
would have an issue with that but it
 
07:08:30.468 --> 07:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
went the other way all this does is say
 
07:08:33.830 --> 07:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes you you did require an increase
 
07:08:37.010 --> 07:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
in employer rates employee rates excuse
 
07:08:37.020 --> 07:08:37.788 align:start position:0%
in employer rates employee rates excuse
me

07:08:37.788 --> 07:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
me
 
07:08:39.530 --> 07:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
but then you also went and reduced the
 
07:08:42.590 --> 07:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
benefit at the same time so
 
07:08:42.600 --> 07:08:43.968 align:start position:0%
benefit at the same time so
that

07:08:43.968 --> 07:08:43.978 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:08:46.190 --> 07:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
though frankly those folks have been
 
07:08:48.770 --> 07:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
paying for the last 10 years
 
07:08:50.810 --> 07:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
they've already they've been asked to
 
07:08:53.030 --> 07:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
know have been doing it for a decade so
 
07:08:54.890 --> 07:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
have you reduced the contribution rate
 
07:08:58.490 --> 07:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
for by the employee no not at all
 
07:09:00.708 --> 07:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
and by rights the argument could be made
 
07:09:03.530 --> 07:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
to do so but again we felt that that
 
07:09:05.390 --> 07:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
would not be beneficial to the system
 
07:09:07.548 --> 07:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
overall to make a reduction so that was
 
07:09:08.750 --> 07:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
left alone
 
07:09:10.430 --> 07:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
the only way you're going to get into
 
07:09:12.948 --> 07:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
this 5.7 billion dollar hole is if
 
07:09:15.770 --> 07:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
everybody pays more obviously this is
 
07:09:17.208 --> 07:09:17.218 align:start position:0%
this is going to increase the
 
07:09:20.208 --> 07:09:20.218 align:start position:0%
compensation for the members but I think
 
07:09:21.890 --> 07:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's going to make a bigger hole in the
 
07:09:23.448 --> 07:09:23.458 align:start position:0%
5.7 billion
 
07:09:24.890 --> 07:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
so keep in mind that this is not
 
07:09:26.868 --> 07:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
instituting a new benefit to anybody
 
07:09:29.150 --> 07:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
this is restoring 95 percent of the
 
07:09:31.548 --> 07:09:31.558 align:start position:0%
benefits they had already
 
07:09:33.468 --> 07:09:33.478 align:start position:0%
so you can't you can't go down the
 
07:09:34.968 --> 07:09:34.978 align:start position:0%
street and steal my bike and bring it
 
07:09:36.830 --> 07:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
back two weeks later and then ask me to
 
07:09:38.448 --> 07:09:38.458 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
07:09:38.458 --> 07:09:39.708 align:start position:0%
pay for it
right

07:09:39.708 --> 07:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:09:42.948 --> 07:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
so I understand that so that that's
 
07:09:45.430 --> 07:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's in essence the the
 
07:09:47.810 --> 07:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
oversimplification of this
 
07:09:47.820 --> 07:09:49.190 align:start position:0%
oversimplification of this
the

07:09:49.190 --> 07:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:09:51.708 --> 07:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
also too
 
07:09:53.990 --> 07:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the most part minus a little bit of
 
07:09:54.000 --> 07:09:55.670 align:start position:0%
for the most part minus a little bit of
wiggling

07:09:55.670 --> 07:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
wiggling
 
07:09:58.190 --> 07:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
in the in the back with this with a
 
07:10:00.410 --> 07:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
differential of 13 million which may or
 
07:10:02.330 --> 07:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
may not exist as this moves forward
 
07:10:05.208 --> 07:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
based on investment returns
 
07:10:08.208 --> 07:10:08.218 align:start position:0%
the this does not increase the debt
 
07:10:10.910 --> 07:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
because it's being pre-funded by the
 
07:10:12.650 --> 07:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
07:10:14.628 --> 07:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
if this was dumped directly into the
 
07:10:15.948 --> 07:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
debt I would agree with you that it
 
07:10:17.990 --> 07:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
would be increasing the debt the overall
 
07:10:20.208 --> 07:10:20.218 align:start position:0%
debt follow-up follow-up What
 
07:10:22.788 --> 07:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
specifically did the speaker ask you to
 
07:10:22.798 --> 07:10:25.968 align:start position:0%
specifically did the speaker ask you to
fix

07:10:25.968 --> 07:10:25.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:25.978 --> 07:10:26.510 align:start position:0%
 
it

07:10:26.510 --> 07:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:10:26.520 --> 07:10:28.490 align:start position:0%
it
[Music]

07:10:28.490 --> 07:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:10:31.670 --> 07:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
to me that's the 5.7 billion hole that
 
07:10:33.288 --> 07:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
is not what we talked about in that room
 
07:10:35.930 --> 07:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
what was discussed in that room was
 
07:10:43.150 --> 07:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:45.650 --> 07:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy of the whole system at 11 and
 
07:10:48.048 --> 07:10:48.058 align:start position:0%
a half billion dollars of assets I find
 
07:10:50.810 --> 07:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
that very very seven billion dollar hole
 
07:10:50.820 --> 07:10:51.650 align:start position:0%
that very very seven billion dollar hole
sure

07:10:51.650 --> 07:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
sure
 
07:10:55.490 --> 07:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
we are we are at 66 funded we rank 13th
 
07:10:57.110 --> 07:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
07:10:59.750 --> 07:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
so why we're not I don't think we're I
 
07:11:03.170 --> 07:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
don't think we're at death's door here
 
07:11:05.270 --> 07:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
so I I had a couple of questions if
 
07:11:07.128 --> 07:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
there are no further questions from the
 
07:11:09.410 --> 07:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
division thus far
 
07:11:11.570 --> 07:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
how many people would be affected by
 
07:11:12.910 --> 07:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
this like
 
07:11:16.490 --> 07:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
1572 1572.
 
07:11:17.810 --> 07:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
so I think there's some important
 
07:11:20.208 --> 07:11:20.218 align:start position:0%
language on the document that the
 
07:11:22.910 --> 07:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
retirement system gave us if we don't
 
07:11:25.070 --> 07:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
fund this 25 million dollar
 
07:11:27.170 --> 07:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
appropriation that is
 
07:11:29.930 --> 07:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
if the appropriation is not paid the
 
07:11:32.390 --> 07:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
employer's contribution rate for police
 
07:11:35.750 --> 07:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
and firewood increase significantly
 
07:11:37.730 --> 07:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
and the expected increase in the
 
07:11:41.150 --> 07:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability would be 203 million
 
07:11:44.150 --> 07:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
dollars so correct going forward if we
 
07:11:46.070 --> 07:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't do this I think it will have quite
 
07:11:48.770 --> 07:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
a huge impact so
 
07:11:51.468 --> 07:11:51.478 align:start position:0%
keep in mind in in the the gentleman
 
07:11:53.150 --> 07:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
from the Retirement Systems who's who's
 
07:11:54.890 --> 07:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
here can talk about the rate drop that's
 
07:11:56.390 --> 07:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's occurring
 
07:11:59.030 --> 07:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the next two years the success of the
 
07:12:01.368 --> 07:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
Investments have made it so that the
 
07:12:05.390 --> 07:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
employer rate is going down in the next
 
07:12:07.730 --> 07:12:09.230 align:start position:0%
um the next two-year cycle
 
07:12:09.230 --> 07:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:11.930 --> 07:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
six percent
 
07:12:14.390 --> 07:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
use your mic representative are you
 
07:12:15.650 --> 07:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
telling me the concentration rate for
 
07:12:18.770 --> 07:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
employers is going on no no the return
 
07:12:20.650 --> 07:12:20.660 align:start position:0%
on the investment
 
07:12:23.448 --> 07:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the rates the employer
 
07:12:26.270 --> 07:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
rates are going down well you talked
 
07:12:28.368 --> 07:12:28.378 align:start position:0%
about improving situation and I'm saying
 
07:12:30.910 --> 07:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
it's minus seven percent
 
07:12:34.010 --> 07:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
sure that that's a substantial drop in
 
07:12:36.288 --> 07:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
the employer rate
 
07:12:39.048 --> 07:12:39.058 align:start position:0%
for and that's locked in for two years
 
07:12:41.570 --> 07:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
so we're not even asking for the
 
07:12:44.510 --> 07:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
employers to absorb that as part of you
 
07:12:45.770 --> 07:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
know say okay you're dropping seven
 
07:12:48.230 --> 07:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're asking for 2.6
 
07:12:50.330 --> 07:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
to meet in the middle we're saying take
 
07:12:53.468 --> 07:12:53.478 align:start position:0%
the seven percent drop in employer rates
 
07:12:56.750 --> 07:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
enjoy it and fund this
 
07:13:01.310 --> 07:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
out of the state coffers to not increase
 
07:13:03.770 --> 07:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
any sort of overall debt to the unfunded
 
07:13:06.110 --> 07:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
liability what is the employer rate for
 
07:13:09.890 --> 07:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
a fireman at this exact moment 20
 
07:13:12.170 --> 07:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
something help me out with that I don't
 
07:13:13.510 --> 07:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
have it off top my head
 
07:13:16.128 --> 07:13:16.138 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's not it
 
07:13:18.048 --> 07:13:18.058 align:start position:0%
if the gentleman from the retirement
 
07:13:20.868 --> 07:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
system could come to the table no that
 
07:13:24.890 --> 07:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:27.350 --> 07:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
you have that off the top of your head I
 
07:13:28.968 --> 07:13:28.978 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number but it's
 
07:13:32.448 --> 07:13:32.458 align:start position:0%
around 29 the employers 29 Points
 
07:13:34.368 --> 07:13:34.378 align:start position:0%
something you know it's not that high
 
07:13:36.350 --> 07:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's not that high you're sure yeah I'm
 
07:13:38.448 --> 07:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
sure 23.
 
07:13:41.570 --> 07:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
23 23. okay my phone so that's going to
 
07:13:41.580 --> 07:13:43.730 align:start position:0%
23 23. okay my phone so that's going to
drop

07:13:43.730 --> 07:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
drop
 
07:13:47.330 --> 07:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
one of it one at a time please yeah that
 
07:13:49.490 --> 07:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
went down the last two years as well I
 
07:13:52.670 --> 07:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:54.830 --> 07:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
but the point the point of overall point
 
07:13:57.288 --> 07:13:57.298 align:start position:0%
is that it's it is going down because as
 
07:14:00.250 --> 07:14:00.260 align:start position:0%
the as the plan that was put into place
 
07:14:02.868 --> 07:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
has been going on for the last 11 years
 
07:14:05.330 --> 07:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
to reduce and eliminate the unfunded
 
07:14:08.390 --> 07:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
liability as successes occur in that the
 
07:14:10.490 --> 07:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
employer rate is adjusted
 
07:14:12.890 --> 07:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
for that based on a termination of a
 
07:14:16.070 --> 07:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
2039 date the employees pay the same no
 
07:14:18.708 --> 07:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
matter what whether the success or or
 
07:14:20.750 --> 07:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
pitfalls that that's locked in in
 
07:14:20.760 --> 07:14:22.190 align:start position:0%
pitfalls that that's locked in in
statute

07:14:22.190 --> 07:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
07:14:24.530 --> 07:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
do you see those folks that this would
 
07:14:26.510 --> 07:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
affect staying on longer did I hear you
 
07:14:28.190 --> 07:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
say that earlier well the carrot has
 
07:14:29.868 --> 07:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
been dangled and that's the point here
 
07:14:32.510 --> 07:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
is we're we're demanding a year minimum
 
07:14:34.368 --> 07:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
they have no choice they would have to
 
07:14:37.070 --> 07:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
give an additional year and by we're
 
07:14:40.070 --> 07:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
talking about a substantial morale
 
07:14:43.430 --> 07:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
change for those groups of folks and now
 
07:14:45.590 --> 07:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
it is more advantageous for them to stay
 
07:14:48.350 --> 07:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's worth more for them to stay and
 
07:14:50.390 --> 07:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
that is the goal ultimately is to get
 
07:14:53.448 --> 07:14:53.458 align:start position:0%
these folks to work as long as they can
 
07:14:55.190 --> 07:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
because the longer they work the better
 
07:14:57.230 --> 07:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
it is for the system
 
07:15:00.948 --> 07:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
for other questions from the division
 
07:15:03.708 --> 07:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
and I'll representative Weiler is there
 
07:15:07.010 --> 07:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the present budget that this
 
07:15:09.770 --> 07:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
25 million is listed
 
07:15:12.410 --> 07:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so no sir so this would
 
07:15:13.968 --> 07:15:13.978 align:start position:0%
be new money
 
07:15:15.948 --> 07:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
when we already have a 90 million dollar
 
07:15:15.958 --> 07:15:17.690 align:start position:0%
when we already have a 90 million dollar
hole

07:15:17.690 --> 07:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
hole
 
07:15:23.570 --> 07:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:25.610 --> 07:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the retirement system
 
07:15:27.530 --> 07:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a question
 
07:15:28.788 --> 07:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
for you
 
07:15:30.530 --> 07:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
07:15:32.868 --> 07:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
um can you go in more detail about the
 
07:15:34.910 --> 07:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note where where does this 13
 
07:15:37.250 --> 07:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
million 860
 
07:15:39.350 --> 07:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
000 on the political subdivisions come
 
07:15:39.360 --> 07:15:41.030 align:start position:0%
000 on the political subdivisions come
from

07:15:41.030 --> 07:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:15:44.270 --> 07:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
that is um that that part is the
 
07:15:46.128 --> 07:15:46.138 align:start position:0%
increase in uh
 
07:15:50.330 --> 07:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
in the the rates in fiscal 2026 that's
 
07:15:52.070 --> 07:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
attributable to
 
07:15:55.070 --> 07:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
a slight bit of underfunding because
 
07:15:58.910 --> 07:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
the present value of the 250 million
 
07:16:02.868 --> 07:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
over 10 years is only 187 million and
 
07:16:05.510 --> 07:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's fully applicable to the group too
 
07:16:09.350 --> 07:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so this is attributable to increases
 
07:16:12.530 --> 07:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
relating to the cost of the increase in
 
07:16:15.410 --> 07:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
the maximum benefit for the group ones
 
07:16:18.350 --> 07:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
so this is a one-time no this is this
 
07:16:21.490 --> 07:16:21.500 align:start position:0%
would be an increase in rates ongoing
 
07:16:24.410 --> 07:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
so the employer the municipal employers
 
07:16:29.330 --> 07:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
will pay an extra 2.6 2.7 percent right
 
07:16:33.708 --> 07:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:33.718 --> 07:16:36.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:16:36.670 --> 07:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:40.010 --> 07:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
yeah in perpetuity
 
07:16:43.548 --> 07:16:43.558 align:start position:0%
I see no let's thank you and if I could
 
07:16:44.930 --> 07:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
just clarify the reason I was high on
 
07:16:47.030 --> 07:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
the rates before is I was including the
 
07:16:49.490 --> 07:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy portion in my head not
 
07:16:54.650 --> 07:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:58.250 --> 07:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
any further follow-up from anyone on the
 
07:16:58.260 --> 07:16:59.930 align:start position:0%
any further follow-up from anyone on the
division

07:16:59.930 --> 07:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
division
 
07:17:03.170 --> 07:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman that that 2.6 and 2.7 is
 
07:17:05.208 --> 07:17:05.218 align:start position:0%
if this entire thing was dumped onto the
 
07:17:06.830 --> 07:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the state paid
 
07:17:08.990 --> 07:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
nothing that is it's not happening
 
07:17:12.230 --> 07:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
simultaneously where the request for
 
07:17:12.240 --> 07:17:13.390 align:start position:0%
simultaneously where the request for
Appropriations

07:17:13.390 --> 07:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
07:17:16.010 --> 07:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
and the rate increase are together
 
07:17:19.968 --> 07:17:19.978 align:start position:0%
that's an either or so if this to follow
 
07:17:22.128 --> 07:17:22.138 align:start position:0%
up on representative McGuire's questions
 
07:17:25.968 --> 07:17:25.978 align:start position:0%
so if the state did not provide the 25
 
07:17:28.190 --> 07:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
million dollar appropriation
 
07:17:30.410 --> 07:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
what would be the impact on
 
07:17:32.628 --> 07:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities what would the percentage
 
07:17:34.788 --> 07:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
rate be repeat the first part of that
 
07:17:36.590 --> 07:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
one more time so if the state didn't
 
07:17:39.230 --> 07:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
provide the 25 million each year what
 
07:17:41.750 --> 07:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be the percentage increase 2.62
 
07:17:44.510 --> 07:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
for police 2.72 for fire they're shaking
 
07:17:46.670 --> 07:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
their head behind you so
 
07:17:46.680 --> 07:17:47.288 align:start position:0%
their head behind you so
yeah

07:17:47.288 --> 07:17:47.298 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:17:50.990 --> 07:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't calculate that I believe
 
07:17:54.650 --> 07:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's on the bottom of the third page
 
07:17:57.350 --> 07:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
it says if the appropriation is not paid
 
07:17:59.510 --> 07:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rates for police
 
07:18:02.090 --> 07:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
and fire would increase by 5.58 percent
 
07:18:06.590 --> 07:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
and 4.4 5.41 percent
 
07:18:09.890 --> 07:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
that's it and the Actuarial accrued
 
07:18:13.670 --> 07:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
liability would increase by 203 million
 
07:18:16.548 --> 07:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
right so that's if the state did not
 
07:18:19.010 --> 07:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
contribute but the benefits correct and
 
07:18:21.048 --> 07:18:21.058 align:start position:0%
the effect on the contributions when I
 
07:18:23.390 --> 07:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
say in perpetuity it's until the
 
07:18:26.208 --> 07:18:26.218 align:start position:0%
underfunding is gone
 
07:18:28.310 --> 07:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
07:18:29.628 --> 07:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
once again the funding's gone you're
 
07:18:32.208 --> 07:18:32.218 align:start position:0%
just paying normal cost
 
07:18:35.150 --> 07:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
so 2040 or whatever yeah correct if
 
07:18:38.030 --> 07:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're on target yeah
 
07:18:38.040 --> 07:18:39.170 align:start position:0%
we're on target yeah
um

07:18:39.170 --> 07:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:42.890 --> 07:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
but the 2.6 2.7 is because the 25
 
07:18:45.590 --> 07:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
million the general fund is putting in
 
07:18:48.490 --> 07:18:48.500 align:start position:0%
per year is a little too small
 
07:18:51.048 --> 07:18:51.058 align:start position:0%
is that right mitigating a little of
 
07:18:54.110 --> 07:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
this increase to normal costs
 
07:18:57.110 --> 07:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
that are involved so it doesn't match
 
07:19:00.048 --> 07:19:00.058 align:start position:0%
out exactly the same could you calculate
 
07:19:02.990 --> 07:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
what that 25 million should be in order
 
07:19:06.230 --> 07:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
not to put the 2.6 Etc on the
 
07:19:06.240 --> 07:19:07.610 align:start position:0%
not to put the 2.6 Etc on the
municipalities

07:19:07.610 --> 07:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
07:19:09.590 --> 07:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult to do a la carte
 
07:19:12.530 --> 07:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
calculations we need we need a new bill
 
07:19:14.530 --> 07:19:14.540 align:start position:0%
that says
 
07:19:19.310 --> 07:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
275. well I mean 27.5 or 30 million a
 
07:19:21.468 --> 07:19:21.478 align:start position:0%
year and then we could have our
 
07:19:24.170 --> 07:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
actuaries I see so we need a bill to act
 
07:19:24.180 --> 07:19:25.010 align:start position:0%
actuaries I see so we need a bill to act
on

07:19:25.010 --> 07:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:19:27.170 --> 07:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
for two reasons just to have certainty
 
07:19:28.548 --> 07:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
to have the whole picture because
 
07:19:30.770 --> 07:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
everything interacts and we can't build
 
07:19:32.510 --> 07:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
a legislature unless we have a bill we
 
07:19:33.948 --> 07:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the actuary ourselves
 
07:19:37.128 --> 07:19:37.138 align:start position:0%
that's a little selfish there thank you
 
07:19:39.670 --> 07:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense
 
07:19:43.128 --> 07:19:43.138 align:start position:0%
further questions from the division it's
 
07:19:44.990 --> 07:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
250 million dollars
 
07:19:46.390 --> 07:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing
 
07:19:49.190 --> 07:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
right but still how does 33 million
 
07:19:50.868 --> 07:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
dollars turn into two points you have
 
07:19:53.510 --> 07:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
you have something to add or no I don't
 
07:19:59.030 --> 07:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:01.128 --> 07:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
it's kind of our motto here's less is
 
07:20:04.190 --> 07:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:05.990 --> 07:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:20:08.510 --> 07:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
the division has several options here we
 
07:20:12.350 --> 07:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
can retain it uh we can pass it whatever
 
07:20:14.628 --> 07:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
it's up to the division representative
 
07:20:17.390 --> 07:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I think there's a lot to
 
07:20:20.208 --> 07:20:20.218 align:start position:0%
absorb here and I move to retain the
 
07:20:20.218 --> 07:20:21.230 align:start position:0%
absorb here and I move to retain the
bill

07:20:21.230 --> 07:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:20:21.240 --> 07:20:24.530 align:start position:0%
bill
second

07:20:24.530 --> 07:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:26.690 --> 07:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
emotions been made and seconded to
 
07:20:28.910 --> 07:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
retain the bill is there further
 
07:20:28.920 --> 07:20:32.650 align:start position:0%
retain the bill is there further
discussion

07:20:32.650 --> 07:20:32.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:35.270 --> 07:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
07:20:37.128 --> 07:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
chairman I so
 
07:20:39.530 --> 07:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
I think the reality of this bill first I
 
07:20:40.730 --> 07:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
want to commend the sponsors and
 
07:20:42.170 --> 07:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that put this together
 
07:20:44.750 --> 07:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
because it is even with all those Roman
 
07:20:47.270 --> 07:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
numerals it is a substantial uh bit of
 
07:20:49.250 --> 07:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
policy and financial changes that we're
 
07:20:51.350 --> 07:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
making are proposed to be made to our
 
07:20:53.448 --> 07:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh for those
 
07:20:55.548 --> 07:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
individuals that join the system between
 
07:20:58.310 --> 07:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
2001 and 2011.
 
07:21:00.230 --> 07:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
um I think the based on the House vote
 
07:21:02.990 --> 07:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
that took place a week and a half ago
 
07:21:06.230 --> 07:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
um it's a the figure for FY 25 of 25
 
07:21:09.350 --> 07:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
million is something we should keep in
 
07:21:11.570 --> 07:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
the budget and find room for in the
 
07:21:13.430 --> 07:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
budget because it's the house position
 
07:21:16.610 --> 07:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
on the policy uh and I don't think we
 
07:21:18.530 --> 07:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
should go to the floor with a budget
 
07:21:20.330 --> 07:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
that we don't think the house will like
 
07:21:22.968 --> 07:21:22.978 align:start position:0%
every portion of it
 
07:21:22.978 --> 07:21:23.750 align:start position:0%
every portion of it
um

07:21:23.750 --> 07:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:26.390 --> 07:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
I would support retaining I would also
 
07:21:31.490 --> 07:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
support uh avert of of strategy of
 
07:21:33.948 --> 07:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
passing the bill as well giving it a
 
07:21:35.690 --> 07:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
separate vote for an appropriation on
 
07:21:38.570 --> 07:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
the house floor along with making sure
 
07:21:41.030 --> 07:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we incorporate into the budget just
 
07:21:42.590 --> 07:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're making sure that
 
07:21:45.110 --> 07:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
the policy and the pages of legislation
 
07:21:47.628 --> 07:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
that been prepared are preserved the
 
07:21:50.570 --> 07:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
right way as presented but I will be
 
07:21:55.310 --> 07:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:59.090 --> 07:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:01.368 --> 07:22:01.378 align:start position:0%
seeing now when the clerk is ready
 
07:22:14.390 --> 07:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:14.400 --> 07:22:16.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:22:16.190 --> 07:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:22:18.468 --> 07:22:18.478 align:start position:0%
um motion to retain representative
 
07:22:18.478 --> 07:22:19.548 align:start position:0%
um motion to retain representative

07:22:55.190 --> 07:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay so it's clear to everyone in
 
07:22:56.868 --> 07:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
attendance that means as you probably
 
07:22:58.788 --> 07:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
already figured out we will retain this
 
07:23:01.310 --> 07:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill as a division there have been some
 
07:23:03.770 --> 07:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
questions raised uh we'll be reaching
 
07:23:05.628 --> 07:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
out to the retirement system to get some
 
07:23:09.048 --> 07:23:09.058 align:start position:0%
of those questions answered
 
07:23:11.208 --> 07:23:11.218 align:start position:0%
and at that we'll let you know when we
 
07:23:14.810 --> 07:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
