believe this bill uh is uh making the
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
right balance of uh securing our
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
elections and it's uh very important
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh for my district and for my town as
 
00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
well because uh uh in my town we have
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
quite a few college students voting and
 
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
there are always some uh friction uh and
 
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 align:start position:0%
U um misunderstanding uh on part of some
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
students like um uh if they can vote uh
 
00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 align:start position:0%
um sometimes they Doms on border of two
 
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
Town sometimes they even don't know what
 
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
town they're voting in uh sometimes they
 
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if they can vote in New
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at all what documents they
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%

study yet I was going to say back by
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
popular demand is the fire act part two
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
improv I love it let's go on the okay so
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'm here to oppose 684 and the other
 
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
bills this afternoon that I cannot be
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
here for even though I knew the date and
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
time of them because I have other
 
00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
commitments so being able to oppose
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
early and do testimony even though I
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
knew the date and time of them it was
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
good to be able to do that little
 
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 align:start position:0%
reference back to the last time that I
 
00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
testified anyway today I just want to
 
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
say can we stop this now can we just
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
stop I would say there was a problem
 
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
with the elections in November but it
 
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't voter fraud I don't like that we
 
00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
have a trifecta plus the executive
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
Council so I have a problem with that
 
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
election but I don't think that there
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
was any voter fraud in that that I have
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
other problems with that election
 
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
because here I have to sit again setting
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
an alarm for 6:00 a.m. to get up here
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
and get here to conquered I'm retired
 
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
now for lack of a better word I thought
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
I was going to be having fun but for the
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
first time in 24 years of living in this
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
state I am constantly coming up here
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
this year and having to sit here and say
 
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
please stop this these bootes do these
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
bills do not help voters have access
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
this is not what people voted for 29,000
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
plus people signed in on a different
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
bill that I can't talk about here but
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
read the room this is not what people
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
voted for I don't know what they voted
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
for back in November but it wasn't this
 
00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you just stop let's do
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
better laws to help people access the
 
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
ballot make it not as confusing for
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
people as students to know what to do
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
what id to have but their ID is valid
 
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
and then if you have a senior who has a
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
a license that's expired more in the
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
year put that on a billboard coming into
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire letting the seniors know
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
that you that they're not who they are
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
when their license is expired for after
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
the year and they have to go make
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
efforts to go get another ID let's put
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
that on a billboard people aren't like
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
this is not what they voted for I don't
 
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
know what they voted for but this is not
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
what they voted for so today I'm just
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
asking you can we just stop isn't there
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
a high road that we can take we have to
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
share this state I have to share it I
 
00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:54.759 align:start position:0%
didn't vote for this I didn't vote
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
Republican but I definitely didn't vote
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
for this and I don't know if other
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
people really voted for this because
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
once they actually know what's the
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
content of some of these bills they sign
 
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
in like in the
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
here uh as a professor at a university
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire a li licensed mental
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
health counselor in the state and a
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
transplant from another state I am
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
concerned with the implications of
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
removing student IDs from the list of
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
acceptable forms of identification for a
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
person I work with a person who is
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
currently enrolling in school at the
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
moment they do not have valid photo
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
identification and the process to obtain
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
this has too many steps for them to
 
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
remember understand and follow through
 
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.350 align:start position:0%
remember understand and follow through
with

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
completing their cognitive imper ments
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
impact their ability to follow
 
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
step-by-step processes and they are
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
limited in their access to supports with
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
completing such tasks they are also
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
limited to the knowledge about uh local
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
election laws and without supports
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
around them informing them they would
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
not know what id is necessary and would
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
just bring the IDS they have in their
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
wallet while processes are difficult for
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
them to understand and follow through
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
with their brain is able to compreh
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
conceptual knowledge and Community
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
College is an option for them they are
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
also able to understand candidates
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
platforms and issues on the ballot
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
making them cognitively able to vote
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
without being able to use their college
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
ID they will likely be in a scenario of
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
not being able to
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
vote this person is not alone in their
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
experience there are many students in
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
the state who do not know this bill is
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
being discussed and do not have other
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
forms of ID readily available we should
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
not expect that everyone in the state is
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
aware of the constantly changing rules
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
on voting as many students are more
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
focused on their studies as they should
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
be Mr Blanchet um have to actually
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
conclude your remarks your time has
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
expired um and that's right about at the
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
end so we can end there thank
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
you apologize um as a note Mr it look
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
like the PDF you uploaded online was
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
corrupted I just tried to pull it um so
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%

was trying to load it and I couldn't so
 
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
if you could just resubmit that that
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
would be awesome I appreciate you

cotti welcome to election law I don't
 
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
before right there there we go hi my
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
name is Lucas corot that R uh and I'm
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
the president of unich Democrats uh more
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
importantly I am a student one that
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
worked to help register hundreds of
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
Voters over the course of the last cycle
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
I informed every single uh person who
 
00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
gave me the time today that if they
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
proved residency in citizenship they
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
could participate in our most sacred of
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
institutions in many cases for the first
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
time in their lives though I of course
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
have my partisan leanings the effort to
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
get out the vote was not my colleagues
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I were approached by many who openly
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
let us know they did not support our
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
candidates and they were without
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
prejudice informed of their rights it
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
would have helped their cause to refuse
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
their inquiries forcing them to do their
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
own research and making it more
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
difficult to exercise their right to
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
vote but that's simply not the kind of
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
country I would like to live in we had a
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
fantastic turnout on Election Day and
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
though the results were not necessarily
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
what we had desired the will of the
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
people was carried out and our election
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
was safe and secure
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
no Caravans of illegals migrants arrived
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
in Durham No Buses of Massachusetts
 
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
voters show it up to the polls what did
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
happen was that thousands of unh voters
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh students legally voted for the
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
candidates of their choosing in our case
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
voting for The Republican candidates at
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
a higher rate than the preceding
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
elections they did so overwhelmingly by
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
using their University issued student ID
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
card which nearly all of us carry in our
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
pockets at all times though my fellow
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
Democrats and I plan to work hard to
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
reverse the growing Republic base at UNH
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
I proudly stand against any measure to
 
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
impede their right to vote our country
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
was built off those who shunned the
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
pursuit of power for selfless gain I
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
understand the logic there's a group of
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
Voters who lean left and a right-wing
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
majority knows it would be to their
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
benefit to disenfranchise as many of
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
those voters as
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
possible I simply ask you graciously to
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
reject this calculus and to let the will
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
of the people and the UNH voters be done
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and you had 5
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
seconds left cuz you know you haven't
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
been watching I like the competition see
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
who can get closest so you got pretty
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
close uh will you be taking questions
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee um are there
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative weie thank you Mr chair
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question you
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you uh always carry your
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
student ID why is that well uh you can't
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
use the public trans uh Transit uh on
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
those uh it's how we access our meal
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
plans um fingerprints are also used as a
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
a biometric uh but I mean I have it in
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
my wallet right now I don't go anywhere
 
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.350 align:start position:0%
my wallet right now I don't go anywhere
without

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.870 align:start position:0%
without
it

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
followup uh so so that gives you the
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
Privileges and the rights to use the
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
things that are being granted to you by
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire would
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
not the same principles apply for voting
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
with an ID
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
card uh I think that uh there's
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
certainly discussion for private
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
universities if it was a St ansam issued
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
ID it's different than something issued
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
by the university system of New
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but that's not the bill
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
being discussed today
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
sir further questions from the committee
 
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you for
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question are these uh ID cards
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
buildings press that button again just
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
say absolutely again there you go yeah
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah there you go it's you're smart
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
to try to turn it off every time because
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
you'll end up like hot miking yourself
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
like I do all the time um further
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh yes
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lane uh thank you for
 
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:11.759 align:start position:0%
taking my question you use this ID only
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
to identify yourself when you vote is
 
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.189 align:start position:0%
to identify yourself when you vote is
that

00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:16.199 --> 00:15:17.910 align:start position:0%
that
correct

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's part of uh uh the process too
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's obviously on the side of proving
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
residency um and my main point against
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
is that uh you know there's been zero
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
cases of voter fraud when it comes to
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
these student ID cards and uh it's by
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
far the most
 
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
convenient further questions from the
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
toner thank you um does a student ID
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
student uh but that's where uh residency
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
specifically in durm and being on the
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
voter roles uh comes into play it's not
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
the end all be all it's it's part of the
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
process further questions from the
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%

no uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
did you know that moderators are
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
permitted to accept any legitimate ID in
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
order to prove identity when a voter
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
preent presents themselves to the
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
polls uh I did not sir I'll say in my
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh time working on the campaign um there
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
there was quite a lot of confusion on
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what uh proper ID uh uh entailed
 
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
and I know that there were several
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
stories from the polls where uh somebody
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
was only able to vote because they
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that they could use their
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
student ID um follow up from Mirad did
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
you know that the for instance the
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
moderator in NASA would be permitted to
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
accept a Sanders um employment
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
identification as proof of
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
identification when a voter PR presents
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
themselves to the
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
polls uh no uh but I mean I'm I'm sure
 
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not the one asking questions here uh
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
but uh is that exactly uh what this bill
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
is looking to address I believe the
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
topic was student
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
IDs thank you further questions from the
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing N I think
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
we'll let the uh uh the gentleman go
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for entertaining us great job
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
by the way great job uh rep uh
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
289 okay all right hold on before we do
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
this because my Des is going to end up
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
completely trashed again can we take
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
that written testimony and put it right
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
there on the end of this table and then
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
members can grab it unless it's unless
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
they is this a copy of your written
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
testimony um so I'm going to leave that
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
there and then members can grab it on
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
their way out cuz what happens is my
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
desk at the end of this is looks like a
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
paper mill um so we'll leave that there
 
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
members can grab it on the way out and
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
that'll be unless there's something that
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
that you need for the testimony like you
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
have a graph or something like that
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
obviously we need that but if there's
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
written if it's a copywritten testimony
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
we'll leave that there and that way the
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
clerk can easily get a copy of it and
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
it'll make her life better and she won't
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
be so angry at me as my paper just takes
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
over the whole desk I don't get angry I
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you that sounds like a very good
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
plan chairman
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
Barry I'm Liz torelli I'm president of
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
the nonpartisan League of Women Voters
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and as you might assume
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
I am opposed to this bill we've already
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
you've already heard testimony about how
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
important student IDs are to students
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
who carry them with them all the time
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
but I want to talk about older voters
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
this bill also gets rid of the exist
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
exemption in terms of expired driver's
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
licenses or passports that has applied
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
to people over
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
65 in 2012 when this legislature passed
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
the voter ID law it wisely realized that
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
at some point people are old enough that
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
they don't renew their driver's licenses
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
they no longer travel abroad they don't
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
renew their passports and you allowed
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
those people to use an ID that was
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
expired without any time frame so it
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
could be more than five years it is on
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of those people that I'm speaking
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
today and say please don't expect
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who is over 75 to have to get
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
to the DMV to get a non-driver ID which
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
will itself
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
expire and then they have to do it again
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
when they are 80
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh you're not try you you have no reason
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
to try to disenfranchise older voters
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would do that in effect so I
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote in expedient to
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
legislate on this bill I'd be glad to
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%

36,000 voters across the state and I'm
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
testimony submitting testimony today and
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
vment opposition to HB 684 this bill
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
seeks to further restrict the right of
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
students by rolling back well
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
established forms of ID out of the 36
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
states that currently have some form of
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
voter IDs in place only 12 do not allow
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
some form of student ID to serve as a
 
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
valid voter ID as allowing student ID to
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
serve as voter ID has yet to result in
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
any egregious case of Fraud and only
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
work to increase the high levels of
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
civic participation New Hampshire Prides
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
itself on I wonder the true intent
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
behind the bill in the wake of HB 1569
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
which will already work to strip
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
countless college students of the their
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
right to vote I see no compelling reason
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill when will when will
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
the restrictions be enough will we have
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
to endure drastic drops in the levels of
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
Youth participation in elections before
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
finally saying enough is enough
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
additionally I argue that HB 684 would
 
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
violate article 11 of the New Hampshire
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution which ensures that quote
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
blatant attempt to disenfranchise them
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
according to the Brennan Center an
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
estimated 18% of citizens aged 18 to 24
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
do not have state issued photo ID
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
student IDs are given to nearly every
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
college student after providing proof of
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%

morning members of the committee um I'm
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
McKenzie Taylor um with America votes
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire campaign for
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
voting rights we are in opposition to
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
684 um wanted to know that under New
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law to obtain a ballot you
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
need to show your proof of identity so
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about today
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
the reason we showing proof of ident
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
identity is to ensure the person who is
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
in front of you their name and photo
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
matches how they are registered um that
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
this is not showing domicile is not
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
showing where they live it is showing
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
that they are who they say they are and
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's why there is a very broad list of
 
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.039 align:start position:0%
acceptable IDs that are government
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
issued like college IDs from the major
 
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
universities um who you know can show
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
that the person who is standing in front
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
of you to get their ballot is who they
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
say they are and by limiting that list
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
it does not you know change it does not
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
help anyone uh make sure that we are
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
having folks show who they are in order
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
to vote uh I also wanted to mention as a
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
previous um person testified that we
 
00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799 align:start position:0%
have major concerns about the um
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
limiting the use of expired IDs um for
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
folks who are over 75 especially I know
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
through doing election Protection work
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um with the New Hampshire campaign for
 
00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559 align:start position:0%
voting rights we have in multiple
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
occasions helped voters who didn't think
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
that they had an acceptable ID because
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't know that they were able to
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
use one that had been expired if they
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
were over a certain age so by reducing
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
removing that um provision as well or a
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
potential of totally removing people's
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
right to be able to cast their ballot as
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
seniors because they are not renewing
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
their licenses or passports um if
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
they're no longer driving or traveling
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
so and I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.389 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
toner so it's been a wee bit of time
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
since I've been in school but does does
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
a student ID now have an expiration date
 
00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
on it or or does it have any type of
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
date of when issued or I believe the
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
student IDs now do have um a date on
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
them and that was part of and Henry is
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
testifying after me he might have better
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
idea that was part of having this be um
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
a way that you could show your identity
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
in order to register
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%

domicile thank
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%

00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee none thank you last up is
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
totz thank you and good morning my name
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
is Henry clemento I'm the deputy legal
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
director of the ACLU of New Hampshire we
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
oppose HP
 
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.630 align:start position:0%
oppose HP
684

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
684
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
um when a person is presenting ID when
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
they're voting as a previous speaker
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
said all they're doing is proving their
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
identity they're not proving domicile is
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
qualification was proven when they
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
registered to vote and so the point of
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
showing an ID is not to have your
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
address on it or to prove that you live
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
in town or that you're an instate
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
student it's so that the moderator or
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
election official can verify that you
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
are the person whose name appears on the
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
checklist that's that's the only purpose
 
00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill does is just
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
simply reduce the number of
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
identifications to less than what the
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
TSA accepts um for people getting on
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
airplanes so for example TSA allow
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
allows you to uh present a driver's
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
license that's been expired for up to a
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
year I know this because I frequently
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
lose my driver's license uh you can
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
present a armed services card to get on
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
an airplane you can present a veterans
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
health insurance card to get on an
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
airplane types of identification that
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed now under this bill
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
um in addition there's actually a
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
process at TSA I learned uh if you don't
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
have any ID they can still ask you some
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
questions to verify your identity so you
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
don't actually even need a driver's
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
license to get on a plane or any photo
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
ID at all
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
um uh and so I'm unaware you know we
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
check in with the Attorney General's
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
office election law unit frequently I'm
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
unaware of any single case in which
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
identity fraud was the basis of a voter
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
fraud prosecution typically what we see
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
is double voting which is the type of
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
thing where someone owns property in two
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
places and votes in two places that's
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
not going to be stopped by this bill the
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
only thing that would be stopped by this
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill is someone trying to vote using
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
another person student ID but there's no
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
reason to think that student IDs are any
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
less secure than any other governmental
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
issued ID especially student IDs that
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
are issued by the University of New
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is the government so I'm
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if there are
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I did I
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
hear you correctly that you said that
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
the act of registration for voting in uh
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
proves intent to
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
domicile um I'm not sure if I said that
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
but that is true
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
um domicile is in part a subjective
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
state it involves uh a place being your
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
Civic home for the purposes of govern
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
participation in governmental s in
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
Democratic self-government and so the
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
act of registering to vote is part of
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
the Declaration of domicile process but
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to say is that
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
domicile is established anden when
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
registering to vote in New Hampshire and
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
not when
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
voting any further questions from the
 
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.029 align:start position:0%
voting any further questions from the

um so if if they're registering to and
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
that's showing intent to domicile then
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with all the other
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for residency correct yes
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the Integrity of New
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's elections by ensuring that
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
all voters present uh all voters present
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh government issued photographic
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
identification when casting a ballot New
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has long been recognized for
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
its commitment to fair and transparent
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
elections House Bill 323 Builds on that
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
Foundation by closing gaps in our voter
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
verification process ensuring that each
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
vote cast is legitimate and that our
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
elections remain secure reliable and
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
free from fraud the vast majority of
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
States already require voter ID and
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
polling consistently shows that
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
Americans across party lines support
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
these ID requirements as a common sense
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
safeguard for our democracy for example
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
I would cite a St Anon poll surveying
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters attitudes in which
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
over three quarters of respondents
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
considered that voters should be
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
required to show a photographic ID
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
before being allowed to cast a ballot
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
and only 19% of respondents disagreed
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
with this view these results correspond
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
well to the commentary and feedback that
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
I have heard from my own constituents
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
who rightly or wrongly perceive that
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
there is continuing voter fraud here in
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire indeed only last night one
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
of my constituents described to me such
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
a circumstance this bill is not about
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
restricting access to The Ballot Box it
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
is about ensuring confidence in the
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
process for those who may not currently
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
possess a satisfactory ID the state will
 
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
continue to assist in providing one at
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
no cost to ensure that every eligible
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
voter has the ability to comply with
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
this requirement the fundamental right
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
to vote is the Cornerstone of our
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
democracy House Bill 323 ensures that
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
every legal vote counts while preventing
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
fraudulent or erroneous ballots from
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
diluting the voice of legitimate voters
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee to pass this bill
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
and reaffirm our commitment to election
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%

00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
that is listed on the checklist and that
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
has already demonstrated citizenship and
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
so forth to the uh the supervisors of
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
the checklist and second of all in so
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
doing it maintains confidence in this
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the voting process as I
 
00:37:10.599 --> 00:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the voting process as I
was

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
outlining further questions for the
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative Mirad thank you
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
question of course do you think sir that
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
a an a photo ID issued by an employer um
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
might suffice to prove identity might
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
suffice to prove that the person
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
presenting themselves to the ballot
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
clerk is the person that they say they
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
are I don't think that there's any
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
identity that could be provided that
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
would prove identity my understanding is
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
that there have been some very clever
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
people uh from time to time who who
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
managed to forge all kinds of documents
 
00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
the question at hand is what is an
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of confidence in that
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
identity for our New Hampshire election
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
process and what I've learned La out in
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
this bill I think reflects that I don't
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be appropriate to
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
take some random employers photo ID uh
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
from you know a private employer in the
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
state or even uh for certain public
 
00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
employeers in the state because the
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
reality is that in the the towns uh and
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
Wards of our state it is highly unlikely
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
that all of the election staff are going
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
to be familiar with all of the different
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
IDs you know that that are presented by
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh these different private employers and
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's not even clear that those private
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
employers would have the necessary
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
Security checks and safeguards built
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
into those IDs so I I think if we're
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
going to be respectful of our election
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
employees uh and of the the the
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
volunteers in the towns who are Staffing
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
the election process we need to give
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
them clear guidelines and I think giving
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
them the guidelines that they should be
 
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
able to accept the the several different
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
identity documents that are still
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh able to be used if this bill passes I
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
think that gives them enough Clarity and
 
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
it allows the Secretary of State to to
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
give them examples of all those
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
documents further questions from the
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
committee representative uh
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
Wei thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
represent parl for taking my question
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
the um I believe the RSA has other um
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
instances where government issued IDs
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
are required do you know off hand how
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
many times that is mentioned or required
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh you you're asking about how many
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
times in in our entire rsas we mentioned
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
the requirement for government ID off
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
the top of my head I don't I I will say
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
however um that I'm aware that in order
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
to drive in the state you require a
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
driver's license to be issued uh by the
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
state after a period of time living in
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
the state and and certainly uh you need
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
to have uh a satisfactory driver's
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
license uh in order to drive um and I
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
believe that the same is true uh the
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
chairman was asking uh on the prior bill
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
about the requirement to fly uh and I
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
think that the requirement to fly
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
frankly is even more onerous uh by a
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
substantial margin than what I'm
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
proposing here in this
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill further questions from the
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank you and thank you for
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned that
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
the purpose one of the purposes of this
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill was to provide uh
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
confidence uh in the voting process are
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
you aware that both the governor
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
our prior governor and not our current
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
governor governor sununu and the
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State have expressed
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
confidence in our
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
existing system and which includes
 
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
trusting the
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
moderators to do their jobs and do them
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
well I'm aware that that Governor sununu
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
has said many things uh and I'm aware
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
that for that matter I have expressed
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
confidence in our election process uh
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
historically the fact that I have an
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
adequate degree of confidence does not
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
mean that I think it is perfect and I
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
think that some of the the concerns that
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
are expressed to me by my constituents
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
are ones that are ostensibly reasonable
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
and that this bill can satisfy and I
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
would put to you that if we look at the
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
November general election there were
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
about 833 th000 voters who cast their
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
ballot in that election and of those
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
only three people
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
did not bring their IDs to the poll and
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
were able to satisfy that that they in
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
fact uh were those people uh we are now
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
in a circumstance where those three
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
people out of 833 th000 are going to
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
need to remember to drive home and get
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
their driver's license or their voter
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
identification card that they probably
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
should have had when they got in the car
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the first
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
place further question from the commit
 
00:41:52.839 --> 00:41:54.630 align:start position:0%
place further question from the commit
representative

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr Barry uh thank you
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
would a global entry ID uh satisfy this
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh requirement for um government issued
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
photographic means from my point of view
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think that it is a very reasonable
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
question let me just before I give you a
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
straight answer let me just review the
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
text because what I will tell you is
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
that um I was going back and forth at
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
the end of the year with OS on getting
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
my bills drafted they were not drafted
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
as as quickly as I might have hoped and
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
so I I will admit that the language of
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
this is not exactly what I would have
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
wanted so let me answer your question in
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
two ways
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative first of all uh the
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
language does support using a United
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
States armed services identification
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
card a federal driver's license a
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
passport a passcard it does not mention
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
a global entry card and I think there's
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
a a fair question as to would a global
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
entry card be sufficient I think it
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
comes back to question around uh as we
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
broaden the number of different identity
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
cards and and documents that the the
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
local officials are going to need to
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
support how many of those people are
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
familiar with those cards how many of
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
those people know what to check for on
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
those cards and I do think at one level
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh that what is in here is is a more
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
than ample set of documents the second
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say to my point about the
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
nature of the language is that I did
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
strike uh in lines uh 7 through 12 the
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
section about recording the state of
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
issuance of out of state licenses and
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
non- drivers ID cards and so forth and
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
that that was struck for me by by the
 
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.079 align:start position:0%
the OS in the drafting but what I would
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
suggest to the committee is that it
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to add back in not
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
that exact language but add back in
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
language for the less than 63-day
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance of that new voter on the
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
checklist to make sure that we have not
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
only the state of issuance but enough
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
specificity around what id they've
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
presented that audits can be
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
performed further questions from the
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%

representative thanks for taking my
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
question um what's the nearest how long
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
does it take for you to get to your
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
closest DMV from
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
Orange uh about 10 minutes for me to
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
drive to my town clerk who is the local
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
agent of the DMV thank
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%

00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
representative P
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you so um as I read this
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
you could still reg you could still
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
register to vote that on the day of the
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
election as and if you if you did not
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a New Hampshire license is this
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
correct if as long as things matched up
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
as long as the state that you're
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
declaring that you just previously voted
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
in matched up with the state issued
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
license thank you for your question
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
representative I understand let me just
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
add to to representative Wilhelm uh it
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
takes me about 15 minutes to drive to
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
the local gas station so you know
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's that um
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
the yeah the the question that you posed
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is not seeking to change
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
one aota of the registration process
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is purely seeking to attend to
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
the process when somebody who's already
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the checklist presents identification
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
to vote and so you know while I
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
certainly have opinions about the
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
registration process I don't think
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's Jermain to this
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
bill further questions from the
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
committee represent Newsome thank you Mr
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
of those 830,000 voters you cited how
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
many used a fraudulent student
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
ID how would I know that thank
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
you were there any cases you got to do a
 
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
followup or right yeah you can say
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
followup I say yes and then sorry are
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
you aware of any I'm aware that I have a
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
lot of constituents who have significant
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
concerns about the voting process
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
precisely because we don't have
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
satisfactory mechanisms in place right
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
now to disprove that there was
 
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
significant student
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
fraud I turn myself off further
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%

you good morning we'd like to thank
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
chairman Barry and the members of the
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to testify
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh in opposition to House Bill
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
323 my name is beatric Buck I'm a senior
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth College
 
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
and my name is Nico derazio and I'm
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
proudly a freshman at Dartmouth
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
College nio and I are both part of
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Civics which is a nonpartisan
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
organization committed to helping
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
Handover community members and Dartmouth
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
students exercise our constitutional
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
right to vote we oppose House Bill 323
 
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
because it would unnecessarily burden
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
student voters and town officials over
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
complicating a process that is currently
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
functioning like a well-oiled machine in
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
Handover I was born and raised in
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
hopkington New Hampshire to parents who
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
always took me with them to town meeting
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
and the polls but when I came to
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth I met many students who didn't
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
have the same exposure to the Civic
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
process my friend and I founded
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Civics after the 2022 midterm
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
elections because we saw that many of
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
our classmates were intimidated by the
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
complexity of the voting process and
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
there was insufficient coordination
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
between Town officials and students on
 
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
voting related matters
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Civics fills those gaps by
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
providing resources and information to
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
help students and community members vote
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
and engage in Civic processes we have
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
spent over 300 hours sitting at a table
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the student center to answer
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions about voting well ahead of
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
every election each election season we
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
create and distribute hundreds of
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
pamphlets of nonpartisan voter
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
information triple checked by college
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
we also host public events that are open
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
to the community uh we host candidate
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
forums where hand Handover residents can
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
come here from candidates for local
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
office Every Spring uh this fall we
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
hosted the chairs of the New Hampshire
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
Democratic and Republican parties on
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
campus to inform students about their
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
respective parties
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
platforms we support all eligible
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
student voters in their efforts to vote
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's regardless of their party
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
affiliation and regardless of if they
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
choose to vote in their hometowns in
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
another state or or here in
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
Handover we are incredibly proud of the
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
strong relationships we've built with
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
Hanover's town clerk Town manager and
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist we seek to
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the administrative burdens on
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
them by making the requirements for
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
registration and voting clear of
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
students and community members we
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
frequently receive messages of gratitude
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
from town officials who appreciate that
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
since we began our efforts many more
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
students have been arriving at Town Hall
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
documentation in Dartmouth civic's
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
experience students come to Dartmouth
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
excited to vote and to be engaged
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
members of the Handover Community my
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
friend Nico here is a great
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
example members of the committee I am
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
sure you remember your first time voting
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
and shared the same excitement I had
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
when I voted last year when I arrived on
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
dartmouth's campus I eagerly looked
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
forward to voting in My First Federal
 
00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.190 align:start position:0%
forward to voting in My First Federal
Election

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
Election
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
but tant Mount to that I could not wait
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
to vote and down ballot New Hampshire
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
elections as well I spent hours
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
researching our states candidates
 
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
because it was important to me that I
 
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to shape the world
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
around me after all this is my home for
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
the next four years and maybe more
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Civics taught me the process
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
of voting in New Hampshire so I was able
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
to take all of my documents to town hall
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
to register well in advance of the
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
election I was surprised by how secure
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
and orderly the registration process was
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
however there were quite a few documents
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
to remember so when election day rolled
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
around I was glad to be able to vote by
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
just presenting my Dartmouth ID which
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
has my photo and verification and an XY
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
reate this process worked seamlessly for
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
me and my fellow students and I know
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
that it was based on reliable precedent
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
from that New Hampshire has supported
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
for many years changing our voger ID
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
laws will only complicate the orderly
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
process that New Hampshire already has
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to have to ask you
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
guys to conclude your marks I did give
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
you an extra two minutes because there's
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
two of you so we got to bring her to a
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
conclusion great thank you I'm wrapping
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
up voting is our civic duty as American
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
citizens and it's also our
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected right
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Civics and our partners in the
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
town of Hanover have been working hard
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all members of our
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
community feel empowered to participate
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
in that process the process is working
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
well and there is no need for the
 
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
DraStic change that hb32 would
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
bring it is for these reasons that as
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
members of Dartmouth Civics we urge you
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee we will are there questions
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee um I I have one who is your
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
favorite Dartmouth college
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
professor and we are we will need an
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
answer and and you're not you know I
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
can't say you're under oath but you know
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
imagine you're under
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
oath you know I've never taken one of
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
Professor Mirad classes but I know he's
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
offering one this spring so I'm thinking
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
about it oh yeah thinking about it heard
 
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
senior thank you I would have to Echo
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
that same opinion
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
oh very very political thank you so much
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
U next up is David Trumble from my town
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr uh chairman and
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David
 
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
Trumble from the town of wear I oppose
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
this bill because I believe that
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
students should be able to freely
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
exercise their constitutional right to
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
vote as far as I can tell there's only
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
been one US Supreme Court case that has
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
addressed this subject it was Sim versus
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
the United States and they did affirm
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
that college students have the
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to register and
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
vote where they attend college New
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also there may be others but
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
the only most recent one I can find is
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
the case of legue of Women Voters in the
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
Democratic party versus Secretary of
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
State the court said that voting is the
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
most fundamental significance under our
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional structure other rights
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
even the most basic are a loser if the
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
right to vote is undermined and they
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
cited the New Hampshire Constitution all
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
elections are to be free and every
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
inhabitant of the state of 18 years of
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
age and upwards shall have an equal
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
right to vote in any election and they
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
say where has domicile and that was a
 
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
case specific to the issue of
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
students um couple things about students
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
I've worked at of New Hampshire college
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years so I do speak with
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
just no some knowledge of it on on the
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
ground two things one is that students
 
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
are active members of their communities
 
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
they live in the area where they go to
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
school for at least 8 to nine months a
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
year which is certainly longer than our
 
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.799 align:start position:0%
six months plus one day snowbirds they
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
work in the community whether it's doing
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
child care or substitute teach teaching
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
or working in the local sub shop and
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
they volunteer and do internships with
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
everything from media to government and
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
everything businesses in between so
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
they're active members of our community
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
they're not just passively sitting in
 
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
their dorm room for nine months they're
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
affected by what happens the other thing
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
is that they are directly affected by
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
local and state issues four examples
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
first is money property taxes is how we
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
Finance everything that affects the rent
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
that they pay we have $7 minimum wage
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
that affects the amount of money that
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
they can earn at their jobs second is
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
social issues whether you're a liberal
 
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
or a conservative and your concerns are
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
lgbtq rights or access to abortion or
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
religious freedom the laws that you pass
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
affect them Health in the environment
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
energy policy in the state affects clean
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
air and clean water and lastly labor
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
laws there was a bill before the Senate
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee last year that dealt
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
directly with the rights of Ra's
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
resident assistance at colleges these
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
students have a constitutional right to
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
vote they're directly affected by the
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
decisions that you make and their active
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
members of Community we should not do
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
anything we can to discourage their
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
voting oh one last thing I forgot which
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
is that you need you to bring your
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
remarks to conclusion so the last thing
 
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
is we want to encourage people to
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
participate in their democracy if you
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
vote at the age of 18 you're going to be
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lifelong voter we shouldn't discourage
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
people from voting when they're young
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
thank you right will you be taking
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh yes Mr
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
chairman uh are there questions from the
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you uh next
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
up is Kaylee Kaylee esto um and then
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
after that we have one more McKenzie
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
Taylor so res gasi can you grab the blue
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
sheet for me start wrapping this up and
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
the reason we haven't started 289 is 289
 
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
is sponsored by a Committee Member so we
 
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to jump the gun
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
yet um thank you chairman Barry and
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
members of the House committee my name
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
is kayy of stadio I'm a Durham voter and
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
public policy fell with open democracy
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm testifying in opposition to HB
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
323 this bill provides an extremely
 
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
narrow definition of governmen issued
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
photo ID excluding both outof state
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
driver licenses and student ID cards
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
these are two measures that indicate a
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
sense of fear in the legislature
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the power of student voting in
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
2016 current Senator Maggie Hassen be
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
incumbent Kelly aot by just 1,7 votes
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
meaning a single class of Dartmouth
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
students alone could have made the
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
difference you cannot without compelling
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
Rhyme or Reason roll back such an unpro
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
statute this bill seeks to craft a
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
solution for potential fraud that
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
seemingly has not and may not ever be
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
occur Beyond its current minuscule rates
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
rates that might I add are certainly not
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
spearheaded by college students but by
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
those who own second homes or are moving
 
00:56:35.789 --> 00:56:35.799 align:start position:0%
between towns in New Hampshire when
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
talking when talking about
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising an entire age group I
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
think you have to be certain as an out
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
ofate voter myself domiciled in New
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as I obtained my masters from
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
UNH I can't see any reason why I
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't retain the right to cast my
 
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
vote where I spend the majority of my
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
time for the past 5 years I have spent
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
10 months out of the year in New
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and just two in
 
00:56:59.950 --> 00:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as many College college
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
students tend to I have come to love my
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
new environment and plan to move here
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
permanently after
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
graduation however even this intent
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
should not be required the sheer fact
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
that out of state college students are
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
counted in the US Census at their
 
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
respective schools where they live and
 
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
sleep most of the time as opposed to
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
their home state should be common sense
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
reason enough additionally in lines 15
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
through 23 of the bill there are
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
exceptions made for voting with an out
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
ofate ID for those who have been on the
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
voter checklist fewer than 63 days if
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill is to make it
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
harder for both in and out of state
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
students to vote which I presume it is
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
then this exception provides ample time
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
for out of state students to join the
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
checklist just before an election and
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
vote so even from a pro voter
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
restriction standpoint I feel that HB
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
323 is not ready for prime time please
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
vote HB 323 and expedient to legislate
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure the rights of many are not
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
needlessly cast aside
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
I accidentally shut you off I apologize
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
I pressed I pressed the left button
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
instead of the right button I'm sorry
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
that was not that was not intentional
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
that was a never uh as I said never
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
attribute to malice what can be
 
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
attributed to uh to incompetence so um
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you and I do
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
apologize about that it was really not I
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
really feel bad about that last up is
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
good morning and members of the
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
committee Mackenzie Taylor with America
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
votes in the New Hampshire campaign for
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
voting rights I'm like to start with a
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
reminder that there is no evidence of
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
voter fraud or wise voter fraud in New
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that we do have what is
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
considered a strict voter ID law in New
 
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because when you go to obtain
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
a ballot you are required now to have an
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
ID that has your name and photo on it um
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
so what this bill will do uh by reducing
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
the number of IDs that you can use is uh
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
limit access to The Ballot Box for
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
voters because folks can be turned away
 
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
simply because uh that they have the
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
wrong kind of ID not in even that they
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
don't have an ID at all um again the
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of showing an ID when you check
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
in is to prove who you say you are with
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
your name and matching name and photo it
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
is not to prove where you live um or
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
your domicile that is a different
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
barrier of proof that you do when you
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
register to vote um and this bill
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
removes you not only IDs from States
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire and college IDs
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
but also public high school IDs so for
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
students and there's more and more of
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
them who turn 18 are looking to vote for
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
the first time but are not drivers um it
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
also removes those um the ability for
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
those folks to use that ID to vote often
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
I voted my first time when I was at my
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
high school as a high school student um
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
and those folks could no longer use
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
their uh student ID for that reason um
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
finally I know I was mentioned that you
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
can get um a free voter ID for folks who
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
don't have other IDs in State this is
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
true but folks do need to go to the DMV
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
which I believe I just looked it up
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
there are 12 locations across the state
 
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's a multi-step process of
 
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
going to a clerk's office and then a DMV
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
um and for someone who potentially
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't drive and they don't have a
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
license which is why they're getting one
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
um that can be a high barrier so the
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
only outcome of this bill is likely that
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
more folks will be turned away um from
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
voting the polls and turning away folks
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
from voting um actually reduces voter
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
confidence instead of increases it um
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
and with that I am happy to take any
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you um on the blue
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%

be on a checklist you have to fill out a
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
registration form which gives your name

declare if you're a citizen of the
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
United States you have to sign it and
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
the moderator supervisor of the
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
checklist or elected official has to
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
sign it there's one other point I'd like
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
to make on Election Day a lot of people
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
have to stand outside in the cold
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%

01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
Hill sum are heat although we don't have
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
elections in summer they just want to
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%

Place vote then put their ballot in the
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
black box that's all they want to do a
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
lot of times it takes less than the
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
required time but you have to keep the
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
voters in mind when you look at these
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%

speaking a little longer than normal but
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is to provide some background
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
behind the modest changes this bill
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
makes to the existing
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
RSA um by way of introduction just nine
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
days ago we celebrated Groundhog's Day
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
when Puck Satani Phil joined the
 
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
plethora of weather forecasters and
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
attempted to forecast how long our
 
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
winter would last there was even a
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
famous movie some years ago Groundhog
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
Day starring Bill Murray why bring up
 
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
this movie because for 18 months for a
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
full year and a half I was the man in
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
the plant at a manufacturing facility in
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
Woodstock Illinois Woodstock just
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
happens to be the location where much of
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
that film was shot and I met several of
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
the uh Woodstock movie extras who
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
appeared in that film while all this
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
Preamble well I spent an extended period
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
of time in Woodstock some might say I
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
was domiciled there but not really I
 
01:03:42.269 --> 01:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
didn't pay for my housing nor much of my
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
food nor for my transportation to from
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
and around Woodstock in other words I
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
was dependent to my employer to supply
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
these basic needs I filled out expense
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
reports and was reimbursed by the
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
company for these expenses to the best
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
my recollection I voted by absentee
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
ballot in another state where I rented
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
an apartment and that apartment address
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
was used for all the appropriate W2 and
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
other IRS tax forms in thinking about my
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
own history it occurred to me that there
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
might be others who are temporarily
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire and who are
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
temporar and who are dependents temporal
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
temp sorry I'm having trouble saying
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
that word um temporarily absent from
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
their primary residence the IRS IGN
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
acknowledges such cases and notes in IRS
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
publication 501 that there are
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
dependants who are temporarily absent
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
from their primary address for the
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
purposes of illness education business
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
vacation military service or detention
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
in a juvenile facility it includes an
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
assumption that the dependent will
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
return home after the temporary absence
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
so here we have a conundrum if a
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
dependent claims to have a domicile here
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and votes here for the
 
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
federal tax requirements they are
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
stating that they do not intend to
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
return home but rather to stay in New
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if that is true if they are
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
emancipated from the person supporting
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
them and they are paying their own way
 
01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
now then the person who continues to
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
list that dependent on the federal tax
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
form is breaking federal tax law on the
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
other hand if the custodian or guardian
 
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
or parent of the dependent has a
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
legitimate legitimate federal tax claim
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
for the dependent then the dependent is
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
committing blatant voter fraud
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
being the conscientious person that I am
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
and wanting to look out for others I do
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
not want dependents or the person
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
supporting them to be in any sort of
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
legal bind so the changes in section one
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
are offered for
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
clarification House Bill 289 also
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
provides changes to section 1A currently
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
the University of system of New
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has affidavit requirements for
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
instate tuition RSA 187a colon 16
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
subsection 18 allows for a differential
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
rate intuition to be charged for instate
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%

01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%

consideration at the top of the form it
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
states this form is only for those who
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%

01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at least 12 months or more
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
not focusing on the 12 months but
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
focusing on the legal residency my
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%

tuition and States explicitly if you are
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
domiciled in New Hampshire that means
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire must be your true fixed
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
and permanent home and place of
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%

be able to claim dependency Upon A New
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident parents federal tax
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
forms so the University of system of New
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire affidavit requires legal
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
residency an intent to remain in New
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in compliance with applicable
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
federal tax laws this bill makes the
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
residency requirements for students
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire overtly
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
consistent with the residency requires
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
requirements specified in the applicable
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
RSA and administrative rules provided by
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
the university system of New Hampshire
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
finally in the last section section 1B
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's a new section that says intent to
 
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
maintain a single continuous presence
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
can be defined by a driver's license and
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
by instate Motor Vehicle Registration
 
01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
there is a provisor for non-resident
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
voter ve motor vehicle registration but
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
that is under 20
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
26146 as opposed to uh
 
01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
26145 and those people who have um such
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
a registration as non-residents would
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
not be eligible to vote so I would be
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions and I thank
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
the committee for their patience in
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
listening to this questions from the
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
Nome thank you very much and thanks for
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in regards to the
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
changes about to increase the residency
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
to the 12 months per the UNH requirement
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
is that fall of foul of federal law
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
saying that residency requirements can
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
be capped at 30 days uh this is not uh
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I I
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate that as I stated I think in
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
earlier in my testimony it was a long
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
time ago I know um but um the focus uh
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
for noting the uh system University
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire is that they
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
require a legal re residenc to be
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
established that's kind of Proviso one
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then they require the additional 12
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
months I'm merely saying that they have
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
to require that legal residency as
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
defined by the University of New
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not the 12 months Proviso so
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
not that is not the requirement there
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question further
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee representative Howard so I'm
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
not sure if this is unintentional or not
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
but the and residency rules uh as
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
established by the university system of
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the and really throws me
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
intentional uh thank you for your
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
question um I would have to look at my
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
original LSR submission and see if a
 
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
change has been made by OS but
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I um I'd be get I'll respond to that
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh later on I I'll research that and see
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
what I originally sent okay thank you
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for questions from the
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that there's a
 
01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
residency uh it's my understanding under
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
under both House Bill and Court
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that domicile and residency
 
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
decisions that domicile and residency
are

01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
equivalent I think we might want to
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at that
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
question later I think we will be
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
further questions from the Comm
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%

first on the table because you yeah it's
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh it ends up being like Mount
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
Washington the end of the day
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes we do have a card thank you very
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
much for hearing my testimony today for
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Lauren banker and
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
I serve as the senior director of
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
government relations for the University
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire um I want to
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
speak to a few concerns that we have
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
with the proposed legislation um
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
specifically wanted to note that state
 
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
law does Grant the university system uh
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Board of Trustees the
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
authority to set policies and determine
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility for instate tuition rates
 
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
and at its most basic which I think I've
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
heard mentioned already
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
is the requ current requirement states
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
that to be eligible for instate tuition
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
a student or their parents must one
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
physically reside in the state for at
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
least 12 consecutive months and two must
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
reside in New Hampshire for some purpose
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
other than obtaining an education uh we
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
think that the proposed legislation
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
tying the right to vote with a residency
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
requirement established by a third party
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
in this case the university system of
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um uh for the purpose of a
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh very different purpose in the sense
 
01:11:58.030 --> 01:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
that uh it creates a tuition
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
differential we think that um there's
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
confusion there and there's hesitation
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
there um especially if a student at a
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
private New Hampshire college or
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
university could vote in New Hampshire
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
after living here for less than a year
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
whereas a student at a usnh institution
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
would not be afforded that same right um
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
additionally one other piece is um from
 
01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
a privacy perspective instate residency
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
status is not a directory of information
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
um that we could share released to town
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
or city officials for voter registration
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
so looking at the bill um we're
 
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
specifically asking that the uh line on
 
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.510 align:start position:0%
specifically asking that the uh line on
line

01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
16 page 1 16- 17 paragraph 2 um is
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
removed uh specifically stating and
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
residency rules as established by the
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire and
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions further
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
question are there questions from the
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane um thank
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
so you don't have any um uh testimony
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
with regard to the other U on lines nine
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
10 and 11 I just want to be clear
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
correct yeah we're just here speaking
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
more in line with yeah thank you for
 
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
your question thank you further
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you next up is representative
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
just fairly just very quickly just as I
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
was just pointed out before from a
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal point that would be disaster if
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
the university system New Hampshire if
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
they had to uh well Tie The Residency
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
rules to voting The Residency um the
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
resumes rules for tuition are based on
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
where basically where you lived um
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
before you enrolled University
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
eligibility to vote is based on where
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
you're living at the time so students or
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
residents of uh if they they live in a
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
place place like Durham while going
 
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
going to school they're they're
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
residents they residents of Durham
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're eligible to claim the domicile
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
just like any other citizen so um just
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
in terms that's very discriminatory it
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
probably would not pass muster under
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
either the us or state constitutions and
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh fundamentally fundamentally
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
unfair and also we shouldn't voting is a
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
good habit good habits in adult life are
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
often formed while you're while you're
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
in college and so this is something we
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
should be discouraging people from doing
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
and I know you you can say well they can
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
vote absentee but then there's an attack
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
um on the right to absentee voting too
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
so absentee voting it's already not that
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
simple and be even less simple so I
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
would just say this is an unfair bill
 
01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional there's uh no
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
reason to pursue it so I would urge you
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
to itl it and I'll also add in a
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
previous Li I worked for the Census
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau and one of the major things
 
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
we do during the denial census is sort
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
out all the duplicate entries from uh
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
young people who are um enumerated at
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
their college dorm or other uh residents
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
near College and who are Mist counted at
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
their parents house quote unquote back
 
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
home and actually it's a record for the
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
person from a back home which is a
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
duplicate which needs to be taken out
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
and this so that's one of the major the
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
census peral actually goes a lot of
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
effort to take any college students who
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
are countered their parent par house out
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
because they are in fact not residents
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
of where their parents live but the
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
residents of where they live so I I
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
would urge you for many reasons to uh
 
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
itl this this peren this bill um so
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
thanks I'd be have to take any questions
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants them are questions from
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you oh
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
thank you next up is uh Lucas Kate
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
coratti excuse
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
me oh you got it the second time yeah it
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
I I I I realized how bad I butchered it
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
karate like a martial arts and
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
definitely not it all right you're up
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
welcome back oh man he wants more okay
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
all right the red is on there we go it
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's on anyway uh listen I
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
don't have a prepared statement for this
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
one but when I saw it on the docket I
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
figured I uh ought to come back up and
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh I really think it is a it's a bad
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
idea to uh tie the UNH system residency
 
01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh requirements which is specifically
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
for instate tuition uh uh tying these
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
tax requirements uh and uh billing
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
requirements to the fundamental right to
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
vote and uh again it's been pointed out
 
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
that the and is uh problematic there but
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
the determination of domicile on the
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
University system website and that's uh
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh section four uh number six 6.1 I
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't know how to say that but um uh it
 
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
says uh will not be eligible unless he
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
has been domiciled within New Hampshire
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
for 12 consecutive months I don't know a
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
single student who is uh domiciled in uh
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
uh at UNH for 12 consecutive months and
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
if you add in that basically what you're
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
doing is uh uh bumping up the age to
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
vote at un to 19 and uh that's not even
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh counting in the folks who are at
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
residence halls for several years which
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
many of us are and the last thing is
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement at the University of
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh University system
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
schools uh that all freshmen must be
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
domiciled uh on campus the first year uh
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's an exclusionary Bill uh that takes
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
out a huge slice of Voters and I get
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
that uh they tend to be partisan uh left
 
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh they tend to be but you know what uh
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
that could flip someday and I see no
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
reason to set a president where we cut
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
out a large population of young voters
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh simply because of who they tend to
 
01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
uh simply because of who they tend to
vote

01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh the creation of two
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
separate classes of Voters one uh who
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
ones who live in Residence halls and
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
ones who rent uh property nearby on on
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
campus well you know what uh the biggest
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
thing I'd point out is that uh at the
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
memorial Union building uh the MB we
 
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
call it at UNH uh every student has a
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
specific mailbox where they get mail and
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
their address on that governmen issued
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
mailbox is Durham New Hampshire uh and
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh that's not even talking about the the
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
folks who uh reside off of Campus who
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
have their own address uh you would
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
think everybody would be covered there
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh but it seems to be uh you know that
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
somebody's looking for an exclusion here
 
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
and I get it's supposed to fix a
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
discrepancy uh but I just don't see it
 
01:19:00.629 --> 01:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
here okay thank you further questions
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
from committee from the committee
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
members represent toner you're a no one
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
gets asked questions like this I don't
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
know why they they the committee loves
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
you I don't know thank you um I just had
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
a question do you are you aware that a
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
PO Box does that establish residence
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
because that's what the Granite State uh
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
Square station addresses are peel box
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
correct uh I'm yeah I'm not sure of the
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
exact classification of the law uh I
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's single student does uh
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
on campus uh but once again uh what I'm
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
speaking out against is uh exclusion
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
here due to residency on campus which is
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
in UN in New Hampshire where we work in
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%

for voting rights um oops just step back
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
a second and remind folks that again the
 
01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
definition of domicile for voting
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
purposes is where folks live and conduct
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
their civic life this is a definition
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
about the voters themselves it's not
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
about their relatives how they're paying
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
taxes about where they live in New
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that they are conducting
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
their Civil Life in New Hampshire um
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
everyone who's voting is required to be
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
18 years old these are adults who are
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire and you know if
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
someone is I'm going to talk about
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
people were talking about living on
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
campus that campus address itself the
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
physical dorm room would be their
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
domicile for voters who um are claiming
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
that whether they you know came in and
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
and lived in do previously and moved to
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
Durham or somewhere else that room is
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
their domicile if that is where they're
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire um we also are
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill sorry we're opposing
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
this bill generally um because of the
 
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
conflating domicile in New Hampshire for
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
voting purposes and the definition of
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
residency by the university system that
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
definition of residency is also totally
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
different than for saying getting a
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license it is much stricter it
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
is um a much longer term process um and
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
this is you know different than the
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
Constitutional requirement um to vote in
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire being domicile um and is
 
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:37.639 align:start position:0%
different than the process of say
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
getting again A New Hampshire ID moving
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
here and conducting your life here um
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore we'd be removing folks
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
from being able to vote generally um
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
because they are not meeting very
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
specific terms of University system
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
domicile um and finally I wanted to note
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
that that sub paragraph about students
 
01:21:59.470 --> 01:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
um in the University system requirements
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh seems to not acknowledge the
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
existence of uh private universities so
 
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
for example St anom College those
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
students are able to again if they are
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
domiciled New Hampshire vote there um
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
but those are not students who are uh
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know counted as either having
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
instate tuition or not um because they
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
do not go to a public university but
 
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
have the same rights um as other voters
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.229 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you um Le last up is
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
representative palazov I apologize
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative I didn't see a card from
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
you so I don't like to let the I don't
 
01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
wait representing May Mark 10 hookit and
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
Dan Bon and my uh constituents asked me
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
to support this bill because a lot of
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
confusion around residency and doile is
 
01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.149 align:start position:0%
confusion around residency and doile is
a

01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
relates uh to college student and this
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill will help to protect college
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
students but also their parents uh
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
because uh uh the
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
situation as is there was allegation
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
that if parents uh uh file for the New
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh voting resident students
 
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
out of state as legal dependent that the
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh committing I L fraud so it it would
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for parents and it would
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for students uh for
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
clarity U where a doile and
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
universities uh where intellectuals are
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
so let's us trust the university system
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh and uh the The
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
Residency rules uh they have already
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
established uh and uh uh couple of uh uh
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
questions so uh regarding uh the end at
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
line 16 uh I believe uh and is essential
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
for this bill to have the effect uh
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
intended and and line 14 already has May
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
so I think end is
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
essential uh uh there were questions
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
about uh 12 consecutive months uh so
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor uh said that uh the bill
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh have it and it's not his
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
intention so if committee feels that we
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
need to put some amendment to clarify
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
that well consensi month so generally
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
like the time residency requirement is
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
not the intention of proposed
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
restriction I think uh that Amendment uh
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
could be made and uh uh lastly uh there
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
were allegations that uh this bill
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
affects right to vote absolutely not no
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh it just uh vote where you reside if
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
you are resident of another state vote
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:08.470 align:start position:0%
absentee in the state where you reside

Infamous HB

1569 which was adopted last year HB 1569
 
01:26:27.109 --> 01:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
upended the voting process in New
 
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire enacting one of the most
 
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
restrictive voting laws in the United
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
States no state has successfully done
 
01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.510 align:start position:0%
States no state has successfully done
what

01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
HP HB 1569 does by requiring documentary
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship to register to vote
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
without an affidavit option federal
 
01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
courts have weighed in on this issue
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
previously determined that a similar
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
Kansas law which imposed a proof of
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
citizenship requirement for state and
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
federal elections violated both the US
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution and National voter
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
registration Act of
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
1993 the court found that the state's
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
interest did not outweigh the
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement of 31,000 citizens of
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
that state that's how many voters were
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
denied um voting in an election once the
 
01:27:22.109 --> 01:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
law was passed the same will be found
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
true here at the current lawsuit at the
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
end of the current lawsuit challenging a
 
01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.950 align:start position:0%
end of the current lawsuit challenging a
HB

01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
1569 lawsuit that will cost probably
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
cost the taxpayers millions of
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
dollars um I have put um a cop I tried
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
to put a copy online of the um original
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh filing of uh in that lawsuit in the
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
district court but it was so big it
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take it so I'll figure that out
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
later but anyway just to let you know uh
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
before 1569 a person uh registering to
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
vote who did not have certain
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
documentation could sign a sworn
 
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
statement at the polls to cast their
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
ballot but under HB 1569 that option is
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
removed leading to eligible voters
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
getting turned away at the polls and
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
leaving them wholly unable to vote
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
despite the proven accuracy reliability
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
and security of New Hampshire's
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
elections hb5 1569 introduced
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental changes to the state's
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
election law that make it materially
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
harder if not impossible for thousands
 
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire citizens to exercise
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
their right to vote changes that violate
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
both the first and 14th amendments of
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
the US
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution HB 1569 requires
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
documentary proof of citizenship for
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
registrant such documentary proof would
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
require birth certificate a passport or
 
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
naturalization papers however not all
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
qualified individuals possess these
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
types of documents or keep them readily
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
available and obtaining them can be
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
expensive and time consuming it could
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
cost up to $100 to obtain a birth
 
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
certificate up to $600 to obtain
 
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
citizenship papers and $150 to get a
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
passport and all three take months to
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
obtain most people cannot afford these
 
01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.709 align:start position:0%
obtain most people cannot afford these
fees

01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
the average New Hampshire citizen does
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
not have enough savings to cover $400 of
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
unexpected fees HB 1569 also violates
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
the constitution in another way under
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
law before HB HB 1569 a prospective
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
voter who is already
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
registered but whose eligibility is
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
nevertheless challenged by a peer voter
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
permitted it was permitted to cast a
 
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
challenged voter affidavit sworn under
 
01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
the penalties of Fraud and perjury HB
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
1569 entirely removes the right to vote
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
by challenge voter affidavit for these
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
voters who have already registered and
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
established their right their
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
eligibility many of them would not have
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
documentary proof of Citizen with ship
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
citizenship with them on Election Day to
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
rebut a surprise challenge to their
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
qualifications I don't know about you
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
but I I don't carry my passport around
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
1569 was enacted despite broad skeptic
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
skepticism about its utility and
 
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionality when introducing the
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
bill to the Senate on April 23rd 2 2024
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn admitted that it was
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
not addressing a present problem with
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
voter fraud in New Hampshire stating do
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
I think there's a huge issue of voter
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
fraud in New Hampshire no I don't
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
because I think if I think if here if
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
there was here we would know it on April
 
01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.830 align:start position:0%
there was here we would know it on April
30th

01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
30th
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
2024 Senator gray expressed doubts about
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of HB 1569 stating
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
that he told the bill sponsor which
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
representative ly that I don't think
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
that we can withstand the court
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
challenge the way the bill was written
 
01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
Senator gray even attempted to introduce
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
a similar Bill house house bill 1370 to
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
remedy his concerns about HB 1569
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality but that alternative
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
Bill I know you want me to talk but I'm
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
going to keep
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
going but this that alternative bill was
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
tabled by the house at a hearing on his
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
proposed alternative Bill Senator gray
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
conceded that the New Hampshire has has
 
01:31:48.109 --> 01:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
not had a problem a lot of people who
 
01:31:51.149 --> 01:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
have been prosecuted for voter
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
fraud at a committee of conference
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
Senator scanland recognized the the
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
burdens that 1569 put on
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
citizens in his testimony he estimated
 
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
that removing the qualified voter
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
affidavit for citizenship would affect
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of Voters who could
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
not otherwise be quickly verified as
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
being previously registered through the
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
centralized voter
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
database I urge you to repeal 1569
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
before our state spends millions of
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
dollars on legal fees to defend it
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution constitutionality which its
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
own sponsors are on record doubting this
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill is not designed to reduce fraud it
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
is designed to disenfranchise voters
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
with no evidence or data to back it up
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
there is no good reason to erect
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
barriers that will stop tens of
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of Voters from participating
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
in their
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
democracy please repeal this bill and if
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
we need to if we need to amend our our
 
01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
voter qualifications let's do it
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and not the way that this
 
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
was handled last year thank you
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um next

and adults with disabilities I am here
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
today because New Hampshire's voter
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
registration laws are failing people
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
with disabilities I urge you to support
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
HB 385 because it is not just a policy
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
change it is a necessary correction to
 
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
an unjust system that has denied far too
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
many people their fundamental right to
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
vote right now people with disabilities
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
are being disenfranchised simply because
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
they cannot easily obtain the paperwork
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
the state demands many cannot drive so
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have a license others face
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
insurmountable barriers to access assing
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
documentation barriers make worse by
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
Financial limitations Mobility
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
challenges and Bure bureaucratic red
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
tape under current law these citizens
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
our neighbors our veterans our seniors
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
are effectively shut out of the
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
democratic process that is voter
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
suppression plain and simple the numbers
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
prove it according to the US election
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
assistance commission 11% of Voters
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
would disabilities reported difficulties
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
voting in 2020 nearly three times the
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
rate of non-disabled Voters a Rutter's
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
University study found that voter
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
turnout for people with disabilities
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
lags behind their non-disabled peers by
 
01:35:11.709 --> 01:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
5.7% points that Gap represents millions
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
of voices silenced not because they
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
don't care but because the system is
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
designed to make it harder for them to
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
participate HB 385 restores the use of
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
the qualified a qualified voter
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
affidavit ensuring that no one is denied
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
the right to vote simply because they
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
lack the right paperwork it maintains
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
election Integrity while making our
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
democracy more accessible this is not a
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
partisan issue this is about whether we
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
believe in a government that truly
 
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
represents all of its people New
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a choice we can continue
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
to allow outdated laws to disenfranchise
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
disabled voters or we can choose
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
fairness inclusion and democracy I urge
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
um in the voters who felt disfranchised
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and whatnot can do you
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
know what percentage of them were kind
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
of accessibility issues you know ACC
 
01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
access to the voting area um
 
01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
accessibilities in terms of being able
 
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
to vote in that capability and then the
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
identification aspect that you that this
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
bill pertains to do you know
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
how those voters that you said were
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised where that fits in in in
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
here thank you for the question I don't
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
have actual numbers on me currently but
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
I can absolutely get those in that those
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh numbers to you by the end of the day
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you uh next
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
Horan thank you very much I'm
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
representing Timothy Horgan from
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
straford County district 6 the town of
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
Durham and um I'm a I don't know if it's
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
helpful or not but to point this out but
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
I am one of the co-sponsors of the bills
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm very uh glad that representative
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
Lane stepped forward and did
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
um a better job of introducing it than I
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
might have I just want to add well one
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
key thing is um the list of who's on the
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
voter list and list of who actually
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
voted that's a public record so your
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
name and address and other information
 
01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
is there so if if there's a large number
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
of fictitious or improp or people who
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
don't exist or people who live in
 
01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
another state or so forth um that's
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
something that uh can easily be verified
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
and in fact uh voting when you're not
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote is a crime um it's
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
potentially in many cases a felony so
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's you know it's not something
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
that not something people would want to
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
do casually you know it's a high risk
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
for well voting is important but still
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
there's a low payout for it so the the
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why so few people are
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
actually caught under this law it's not
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
because the state isn't looking for them
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office and the
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office actually put a
 
01:38:27.629 --> 01:38:27.639 align:start position:0%
lot of effort into detecting illegal
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
voters is because not that many people
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
take the risk and um as
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
for and as for out of state voters I
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
said it's a felony most people live out
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
of state would rather vote in their own
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
state election they don't really care
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
that much about ours so I would I would
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
so I would say that's one reason why
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary as well as the
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
fact that many people well especially
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
the disabled it's particularly different
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
many people don't necessarily have all
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
the necessary documents you know at hand
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
immediately on on Election Day but they
 
01:39:00.589 --> 01:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
still want to go go vote and I think
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
they should be allowed to vote and if
 
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing so illegally um they will
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
be caught in uh they they'll probably be
 
01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
caught in due coures subject to fairly
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
severe penalty so I would say uh and and
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
guess the flip side of that is there's
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
always a so-called sufficiently
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
determined person argument you
 
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
especially here in gun bills any
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
anything that's what guns you always say
 
01:39:23.709 --> 01:39:23.719 align:start position:0%
well a sufficiently determined person
 
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
still um get a gun which is um but the
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
same thing is true with this officially
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
determined version could probably use
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
someone else's identification or forg an
 
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
identification so like this doesn't stop
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
the mythical sufficiently motivated
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
person it just uh but it does stop have
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
to ask you to bring your remarks to a
 
01:39:45.589 --> 01:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
conclusion oh your time inspired I used
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
up my two minutes yes so I I I would
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
just say this um this this bill is uh
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
this bill this is a good bill so I I'm
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
used I'm so used to testifying against
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
Bad bills this is a good bill I think it
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
corrects a mistake that was made last
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
year and so uh we should we should pass
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
the bill so there's uh every citizen has
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
the right to vote will you be taking
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee sure if
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
anybody questions from the committee
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%

from the town of where I support this
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
this bill sometimes it takes a great
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
deal of wisdom to acknowledge when an
 
01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
error has been made and passing
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
1569 last year was an error the room was
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
filled with people who came in last year
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
to testify against that bill telling you
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
all kinds of circumstances in which
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
people can't access those documents on
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
voting day and would lose their right to
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
vote you heard the stories about people
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
people whose house were on fire and many
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
many stories from town clerks all around
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
the state the statistics were also
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
offered last time that between one to
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
4,000 voters in the 2020 and 2022
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
elections were
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised because if it would have
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
been disenfranchised if they could not
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
have put an affidavit forward as has
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
been testified in other voting bills New
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the 50th most difficult
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
state to vote in we don't have a voter
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
fraud problem there was no reason to
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
take 4,000 people and say we don't want
 
01:41:30.589 --> 01:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
you to participate in our elections
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
anymore as for the proof of citizenship
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
papers the Brennan Center for justice
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
did a report just last year called
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
millions of Americans don't have
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
documents proving their citizenship
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
readily available almost 22 million
 
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
Americans 9% of American citizens don't
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
have proof of citizenship readily
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
available and 3.8 million which is more
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
than 1% don't have these documents at
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
all because they have been lost
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
destroyed or stolen there's no way you
 
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
can get those documents in time if they
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
were lost or
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
destroyed without the the lag time for
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
you to get a citizenship paper or to get
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
an out ofst State birth certificate or
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
file for a pass passport why would we
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
want to tell thousands of New Hampshire
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
people you can't vote just because of
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances beyond your control it
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
takes wisdom to admit we were wrong we
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
all want people to participate in our
 
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
democracy no matter what party they're
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%

forward good morning chairman Barry

empowering young people in New Hampshire
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh here today to testify in support of
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
house spill 385 which would Restore New
 
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh long-standing secure and
 
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
accessible voter registration process um
 
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation ensures that every
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
voter regardless of age background or
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
life circumstance has a fair and
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable opportunity to register and
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
cast their ballot
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
um you've heard from other speakers
 
01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
today so I'll summarize but New
 
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has historically set a gold
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
standard for uh election integrity and
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
accessibility of our elections for years
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
voters who lacked documents at the time
 
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
of registration could sign a sworn
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
affidavit under a penalty of perjury
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
that they uh have their eligibility
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
verified through existing safeguards
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
this system worked it was Secure
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
efficient and upheld folks right to vote
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
but under the restrictive system in
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
place today in Hampshire has now one of
 
01:43:57.589 --> 01:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
the most burdensome voter registration
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
processes in the
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
country the impact of these restrictions
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh is real young people and new
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
residents often do not have immediate
 
01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
access to documents like birth
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
certificates or passports making it
 
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
harder for them to
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
register um I would also add that
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
election officials across our political
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
Spectrum agree that New Hampshire
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
elections are safe uh and secure already
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
um and if this body is serious about
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
election security we could prioritize
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
some uh much more proactive reforms um
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
but today ask you to uh support House
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 385 as a common sense solution to
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
restore proven secure voter registration
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
process in New
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I would take any questions
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions um no all
 
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
right awesome thank you I think you have
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
the record for shortest speaker of the
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
day FY which is a i i consider that to
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
be the ultimate award but um next up is
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh Sarah shinard and then last up will
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
zinc hello I'm Sarah shanard I'm with
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire campaign for voting
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
rights and America votes and we are here
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
in support of HB 385 HB 385 would
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
restore a critical safeguard for voters
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire by repealing hb1 1569 a
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
law that creat created unnecessary
 
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
barriers to voter registration this bill
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
ensures that eligible voters are not
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
turned away simply because they lack
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
immediate access to specific documents
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
for decades New Hampshire has allowed
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
voters to register by signing a sworn
 
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
affidavit under penalty of perjury if
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
they did not have proof of identity age
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
citizenship or domicile that system
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
worked there was never any evidence of
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
fraud or
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
misuse passing hb1 1569 upended that
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
system forcing voters to provide
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
specific documents that many do not
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
carry with them or may struggle to
 
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
obtain there are many problems with hb1
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
1569 but I want to focus on its
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
requirement for documentary proof of
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
citizenship it is not difficult to
 
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
imagine that many voters do not have a
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
birth certificate passport or
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
naturalization papers readily available
 
01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
acquiring these documents can be a long
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
and costly process especially for voters
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
who were born outside of New Hampshire
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
and cannot acquire a birth certificate
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
in state or those who have changed their
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
names and do not have their current name
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
on a birth certificate HB 385 corrects
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
this mistake and ensures that all
 
01:46:35.310 --> 01:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
eligible Granite Staters can exercise
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
their right to vote I'll take questions
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%

01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
domicile um I'll just say I'm 44 years
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
old my birth certificate is still in my
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
baby book at my mom's house she hasn't
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
given me the document yet so at least I
 
01:47:35.709 --> 01:47:35.719 align:start position:0%
know where my birth certificate is it's
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
at my mom's house uh but but some of us
 
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
might be estranged from our parents and
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
not have access to our birth certificate
 
01:47:45.589 --> 01:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's important um that we think about
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
all voters what about a voter who might
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
have had a flood or a fire or maybe a
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
homeless voter that may not have access
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
to the those documents there are many
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
reasons why you might not have a p a
 
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
passport um such as the cost so I think
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's important that they many these
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
voters still have the right to vote in
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire Constitution um part
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
two article
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
11 also this um Bill House Bill 1569
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
disenfranchises and creates um barriers
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
to registration um I do have the data uh
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
from the November 5th
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
20204 election there were
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
347 people who didn't have
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
identification when they were voting
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
347 um this is in a January 2nd letter
 
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
um from the Secretary of State's office
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't I the vast majority of
 
01:48:47.589 --> 01:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
Voters at least in my polling place had
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
to sign an affidavit more than 50% of
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
Voters had to sign an affidavit
 
01:48:53.589 --> 01:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
registering to vote for the first time
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
most of the time it was because they
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
forgot citizenship paperwork most people
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
don't show up with nothing they show up
 
01:49:01.149 --> 01:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
with their driver's license or maybe a
 
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
utility bill um but they they there's
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
four things people have to prove and not
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
everyone shows up with all of that
 
01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
paperwork so I think it's important for
 
01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:11.639 align:start position:0%
us to ensure that every granted Stater
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
can vote um so please support um this
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
with an a to
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
pass one second left you get the award
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%

01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%

uh voter ID
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
system for this person for this bill we
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
are assuming a person may have recently
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
just moved to New Hampshire and not yet
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to get their driver's
 
01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
license exchanged for New Hampshire
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%

to vote in in their new HomeTown even
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
when you're using their out of state

driver's license as
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
identification this person would still
 
01:51:15.149 --> 01:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
need to confirm their new residents and
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
show they are indeed voting in the CK
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%

state identification the supervisor
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
checklist should point out to this voter
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
that they will not be permitted to vote
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
at any subsequent election in New
 
01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:32.199 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's driver's license or ID
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
card this bill provides a helpful grace
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
period for a new Resident rather than an
 
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
inflexible ban on use of an out ofate

01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%

01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%

01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
command to myself to speak English and
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
um with that thank you Miss zinc um I'm
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
Olivia zinc executive director of open
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
democracy but I also serve as a city
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
counselor which makes me a Selectmen in
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
my polling location and I was asked by
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
the Peabody home which is the nursing
 
01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
home in our town to help wheel in
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
elderly voters at the state primary and
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
at the state primary I wheeled in an
 
01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:32.679 align:start position:0%
elderly voter who had a main driver's
 
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
license because she's at the nursing
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
home in Franklin but has a main driver's
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
license inv voted in the state primary
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
so if we're if we pass this legislation
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
we would tell
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
this voter that they would have to go to
 
01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
the DMV and get a New Hampshire driver's
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
license even though they're not d
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
driving because they're in a wheelchair
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how they're going to
 
01:52:58.990 --> 01:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
get down to conquer to get a new
 
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license and they're going to
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
have to do that between the state
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
primary and the general election um so I
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
I think that there are other
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances I understand what the
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
representative is saying is is if a
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
person is moving into the state they can
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
they have one time to vote and then they
 
01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
get a new driver's license that makes
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
sense for most people who are moving to
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
the state and and establishing residents
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
but there are some circumstances like
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
this resident who voted in my town um in
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
a nursing home and I don't know that
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
you're really going to want a
 
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
90-year-old to go uh get a new driver's
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
license probably means that 90-year-old
 
01:53:40.589 --> 01:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
will not have a constitutional right to
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
vote happy to take a question are
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:46.390 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:49.069 --> 01:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
wearying so there are uh thank you Mr
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
question Mr Sing uh so uh there are
 
01:53:54.589 --> 01:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
carve outs Elsewhere
 
01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
for um elderly voters um you'd be okay
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
with this as long as there was an
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate carve out for the elderly
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
voters then I I think that that voter is
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
a is a is one circumstance but I think
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
you'd want to think about all of the
 
01:54:12.430 --> 01:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
different people who might like a
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
military voter for example doesn't isn't
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
required to get a new driver's license
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
every place they move so if they're
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
deployed and and are here for a period
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
um they could use their a military ID or
 
01:54:28.589 --> 01:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
their driver's license from another
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
state so I think there are other
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances where people do vote using
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
out ofate IDs that we we do allow so you
 
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
want to think about what are what are
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
all those circumstances um this was one
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
story and one example of the elderly
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
voter at a nursing home but I think you
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
I think there are military voters and
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
there might be other voters that have
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
other circumstances why they they may
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
use an out of state ID so if you do one
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
about you should do it for all voters
 
01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.750 align:start position:0%
about you should do it for all voters
thank

01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
you represent mhe thank you thanks for
 
01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
question my understanding is that the
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
only function of a photo
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
ID when a voter prevent present
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
themselves to the ballot clerk on voting
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
day is to prove that the person is the
 
01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
person who they say they are is that
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
your understanding correct that is my
 
01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
understanding proving identity so their
 
01:55:23.069 --> 01:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
name and their photo follow up followup
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thanks for taking
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
the followup
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
question given that every state in the
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
country now uses real ID compliant
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses is there any reason to
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
think that a driver's license from any
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
of the 49 other states of this great
 
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
country would prove somebody's identity
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
in a less reliable way than a New
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license would prove
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
their identity no thank you further
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
where thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David
 
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:05.719 align:start position:0%
Trumble from the town ofwar I do oppose
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I I certainly understand that
 
01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
if a person I would say they leave
 
01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
college and or maybe they go somewhere
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
else to get a job and they're settling
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
down in Minnesota or they let were in
 
01:56:18.669 --> 01:56:18.679 align:start position:0%
Minnesota they came to New Hampshire at
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
some point they need to establish that
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is their home but I I
 
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anybody address how this
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
would affect the college students that
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
we were talking about earlier because if
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
you let's say you live in Massachusetts
 
01:56:33.149 --> 01:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's where you grew up you come to UNH
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
or St a or someplace to go to school
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
here you have an out of state driver's
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
license you can use that to identify
 
01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
yourself one time so let's suppose
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
you're a very active person you go to
 
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
the primary you want to go to your local
 
01:56:47.950 --> 01:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
elections every single year in March
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
because you think what's going on at the
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
local level matters to you you got State
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
elections every two years during your
 
01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
four years of college you could easily
 
01:56:57.550 --> 01:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
vote several times but this this would
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
say you can't vote in New Hampshire
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
unless you get a driver's license in New
 
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it that doesn't seem to be
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
any justifiable reason to put that
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
restriction on people they are living
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
here for eight or nine months of the
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
year this is where they live the laws we
 
01:57:15.149 --> 01:57:15.159 align:start position:0%
pass affect them very directly they
 
01:57:17.470 --> 01:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to conduct their civic
 
01:57:19.709 --> 01:57:19.719 align:start position:0%
life voting in New Hampshire so the
 
01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
onetime rule doesn't work work for
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
college students nor would it work
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
obviously for military people or for
 
01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
elderly people it's well intentioned to
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
catch that person who moves in from
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
Minnesota or Arkansas but there's a
 
01:57:35.069 --> 01:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
better ways to do that than to take away
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
people's fundamental right to vote thank
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you will be taking questions
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%

obtaining uh birth birth certificate
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
requires the Secretary of State to

reimburse the municipality for issuance
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%

03:04:15.790 --> 03:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
to generally support this bill um there
 
03:04:18.190 --> 03:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
is no question that in the last session
 
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:04:22.830 --> 03:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
legislature the um requirements for
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
registering to vote uh tightened up
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
quite a bit where uh prospective voters
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
are now required to provide documents
 
03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
that show
 
03:04:34.910 --> 03:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
qualifications uh in including
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications for
 
03:04:40.389 --> 03:04:40.399 align:start position:0%
citizenship that is also an issue that
 
03:04:43.190 --> 03:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
has taken on some significance
 
03:04:45.990 --> 03:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
nationally where many states are
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
concerned uh with the citizenship
 
03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:49.990 align:start position:0%
concerned uh with the citizenship
verification

03:04:49.990 --> 03:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
verification
 
03:04:53.429 --> 03:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
issue and there has been uh greater
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
demands placed on the federal government
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
agencies who have databases that that
 
03:05:02.750 --> 03:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
house citizenship information to make
 
03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
that information available to the state
 
03:05:07.269 --> 03:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
so that they can do a better job
 
03:05:07.279 --> 03:05:10.429 align:start position:0%
so that they can do a better job
verifying

03:05:10.429 --> 03:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:13.349 --> 03:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
checklists this bill is specific to
 
03:05:16.990 --> 03:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that are uh Indigent that
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
may have trouble finding uh their
 
03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:21.429 align:start position:0%
may have trouble finding uh their
citizenship

03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
03:05:23.590 --> 03:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
documentation uh frankly I think the
 
03:05:25.229 --> 03:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
issue is broader than that that there
 
03:05:28.110 --> 03:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
may be individuals that might need help
 
03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
who are not Indigent and I think that
 
03:05:32.670 --> 03:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
should be a consideration when you're
 
03:05:35.950 --> 03:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
discussing this bill um at the secretary
 
03:05:38.590 --> 03:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
of state level uh I've been working with
 
03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:39.910 align:start position:0%
of state level uh I've been working with
other

03:05:39.910 --> 03:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:05:42.309 --> 03:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
secretaries uh trying to get the federal
 
03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
agencies to be a little bit more
 
03:05:46.990 --> 03:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
proactive and helpful in terms of making
 
03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
the information and their citizenship
 
03:05:52.070 --> 03:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
databases more readily available for
 
03:05:54.510 --> 03:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
this purpose and hopefully we will make
 
03:05:56.269 --> 03:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
some success
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
there um in terms of the the fiscal note
 
03:06:02.229 --> 03:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
and the requirement that the Secretary
 
03:06:05.190 --> 03:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
of State reimburse municipalities for
 
03:06:08.590 --> 03:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
vouchers that are issued to obtain birth
 
03:06:08.600 --> 03:06:09.910 align:start position:0%
vouchers that are issued to obtain birth
certificate

03:06:09.910 --> 03:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
03:06:12.349 --> 03:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
information um I think that's a positive
 
03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
thing I will say that the division of
 
03:06:16.870 --> 03:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
Vital Records is within the Secretary of
 
03:06:18.510 --> 03:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
State's office
 
03:06:20.750 --> 03:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
and those documents are issued from
 
03:06:24.190 --> 03:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
vital records and we actually build the
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
towns when they issue birth certificates
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
and things like that so um we may be
 
03:06:32.590 --> 03:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
able to just give a waiver or something
 
03:06:34.990 --> 03:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
instead of having a you know policy of
 
03:06:38.429 --> 03:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so U with all of that said
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions other
 
03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:06:45.309 --> 03:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
committee representative wood I don't
 
03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
know if um this came up your discussion
 
03:06:50.229 --> 03:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
oh first of all thank you taking my
 
03:06:53.550 --> 03:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
question um what is the cost for this
 
03:06:56.830 --> 03:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
roughly um I noticed we talk about
 
03:06:59.389 --> 03:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
Indigent and there's no definition I'm
 
03:07:02.110 --> 03:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
assuming that they just have to claim to
 
03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
be Indigent answer could you answer that
 
03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
question how do you claim how how do you
 
03:07:08.110 --> 03:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
make this claim how do you define it
 
03:07:12.269 --> 03:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
thank you we have a great example um
 
03:07:16.389 --> 03:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
right now with voter ID if a voter who
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
does not have a driver's license or a
 
03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
non-driver ID issued by
 
03:07:27.150 --> 03:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
DMV uh can can they can a person who is
 
03:07:28.830 --> 03:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
Indigent can go to the
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
clerk and assert that they do not have
 
03:07:36.910 --> 03:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
either of those two uh uh IDs and the
 
03:07:39.790 --> 03:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
clerk will issue a voucher for that
 
03:07:44.510 --> 03:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
voter to go to DMV and obtain a an ID
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
for voting purposes
 
03:07:49.229 --> 03:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
only and in that case the secretary of
 
03:07:51.910 --> 03:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
state will reimburse the Division of
 
03:07:54.190 --> 03:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles for the production of
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
that ID it is used very very very
 
03:08:01.309 --> 03:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
infrequently most people have the ID
 
03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
that they need for that purpose this may
 
03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
be a little bit different and you know I
 
03:08:08.150 --> 03:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people might uh want
 
03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
to ex exercise the voucher
 
03:08:15.510 --> 03:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
process but to the extent that that
 
03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
other individuals may also need this
 
03:08:20.070 --> 03:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
help that the Secretary of State's
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
office may require some resources to
 
03:08:24.870 --> 03:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
help cover the costs of paying for the
 
03:08:27.190 --> 03:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
searches that are done at the federal
 
03:08:31.150 --> 03:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
level um and designating someone to uh
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
go through that
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
process we want people to to go through
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
the exercise of showing that you know
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
they're qualified to be a voter we don't
 
03:08:42.630 --> 03:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
want that process to be
 
03:08:44.910 --> 03:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
honorous um and to the extent that we
 
03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
follow yes thank you for the followup
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering the question
 
03:08:59.389 --> 03:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
better than I posed it um what do you
 
03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
what do you estimate the cost for one
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
person to get this information do you
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
have a rough
 
03:09:08.670 --> 03:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
idea uh not not a good idea but what I
 
03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that that there are
 
03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
federal agencies now that will look up
 
03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:14.469 align:start position:0%
federal agencies now that will look up
citizenship

03:09:14.469 --> 03:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
information upon request but there's a a
 
03:09:19.510 --> 03:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
fee that goes along with that I think
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's might be between $3 and $4 for each
 
03:09:25.830 --> 03:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
search that they
 
03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
do other questions from the
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane thank you
 
03:09:34.349 --> 03:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
03:09:36.190 --> 03:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
do other states have a similar
 
03:09:38.349 --> 03:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
requirement to
 
03:09:43.510 --> 03:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
this other states require um that voters
 
03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:44.510 align:start position:0%
this other states require um that voters
provide

03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:09:46.590 --> 03:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
documentation more and more states are
 
03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
including citizens ship in that
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I know that uh the law that passed in
 
03:09:58.150 --> 03:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is maybe stricter than
 
03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
most um but I know that there are many
 
03:10:02.990 --> 03:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
states that are dealing with this
 
03:10:06.910 --> 03:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
issue I have followup please yes thank
 
03:10:10.510 --> 03:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
you um last session a similar bill was
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
brought in for Roman
 
03:10:16.990 --> 03:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
numeral two which is lines three through
 
03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:18.190 align:start position:0%
numeral two which is lines three through
15

03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
15
 
03:10:22.030 --> 03:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
and it became apparent that the types of
 
03:10:24.750 --> 03:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
U databases and the sharing of that
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
information was not um up and running so
 
03:10:32.229 --> 03:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
to speak and it sounded like we were
 
03:10:33.510 --> 03:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
saying that it's still not up and
 
03:10:35.469 --> 03:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
running is that did I misunderstand or
 
03:10:37.870 --> 03:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
is that the case no that is the case
 
03:10:40.750 --> 03:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
there is no single database that a
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
person can go to and get citizenship
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
information from uh citizens of the
 
03:10:50.429 --> 03:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
United States there are three or four
 
03:10:54.349 --> 03:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that have citizenship
 
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
information uh they have different
 
03:10:58.830 --> 03:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
requirements to be able
 
03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
to get that information from them and so
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
there really does need to be a
 
03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
coordinated effort if uh documentation
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be required at the state
 
03:11:11.309 --> 03:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
level to prove
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
citizenship to have the feds help make
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
that information more readily available
 
03:11:21.790 --> 03:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
and that is an ongoing uh
 
03:11:25.229 --> 03:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
process further questions from the
 
03:11:27.710 --> 03:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative promo Brian
 
03:11:28.950 --> 03:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:11:31.710 --> 03:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
sir uh I want to follow up on a question
 
03:11:36.349 --> 03:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
that was just asked uh about the cost of
 
03:11:39.950 --> 03:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
getting non non um non-driver
 
03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:41.469 align:start position:0%
getting non non um non-driver
identification

03:11:41.469 --> 03:11:41.479 align:start position:0%
identification
 
03:11:46.349 --> 03:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
so if a person is this is bothering me
 
03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
my face um
 
03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
if a person is is unable to afford
 
03:11:53.469 --> 03:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
getting um an
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
ID they just simply would make that
 
03:11:57.790 --> 03:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
known to the clerk and then the clerk
 
03:11:59.870 --> 03:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
would tell you and then you wouldn't be
 
03:12:02.590 --> 03:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
charging them for it so there's not an
 
03:12:05.190 --> 03:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
honorous procedure for this person to go
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
through to prove that they don't have
 
03:12:10.030 --> 03:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
the funding for to pay for that that's
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
is that how it is
 
03:12:16.750 --> 03:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
so right now with with proving identity
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
for obtaining
 
03:12:22.150 --> 03:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
a uh a ballot at the polling
 
03:12:24.910 --> 03:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
place an Indigent person who does not
 
03:12:28.110 --> 03:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
have any form of photo ID doesn't have a
 
03:12:31.349 --> 03:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
driver's license or a non-driver ID can
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
go to the clerk and say I can't
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
afford this you know getting this ID
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
card I do not have a driver's license I
 
03:12:44.229 --> 03:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
do not have um a non-driver
 
03:12:47.389 --> 03:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
ID and they assert that to the clerk the
 
03:12:50.469 --> 03:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
clerk can then issue a voucher that that
 
03:12:53.469 --> 03:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
individual can take with them to any
 
03:12:56.469 --> 03:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle office and have that ID
 
03:13:00.269 --> 03:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
produced for them for no charge but then
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State uh honoring that
 
03:13:06.110 --> 03:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
voucher will be assessed by the DMV I
 
03:13:12.990 --> 03:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
issued representative Bay thank you Mr
 
03:13:18.990 --> 03:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh um thank you for taking my
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
question um without the definition of a
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
clear definition of indigent as a
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative would
 
03:13:29.469 --> 03:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
indicated so
 
03:13:33.550 --> 03:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
if uh if this is for proving citizenship
 
03:13:36.229 --> 03:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
so the and they can't afford to get the
 
03:13:37.990 --> 03:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
documentation to prove citizenship
 
03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:38.950 align:start position:0%
documentation to prove citizenship
wouldn't

03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
that by implication
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
Define the Indigent to be whatever is
 
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
the most expensive uh rout
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
to get proof of citizenship so if you
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
can't afford that then you're
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
Indigent I that's a good question and I
 
03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
think it's a debatable uh definition um
 
03:14:03.150 --> 03:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
one thing I should say is that this
 
03:14:05.830 --> 03:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
voucher system that is in this bill
 
03:14:07.590 --> 03:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
would only work
 
03:14:11.950 --> 03:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
for citizens who were born in New
 
03:14:14.469 --> 03:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I don't think the state of
 
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania is going to honor a voucher
 
03:14:21.990 --> 03:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
from a New Hampshire town clerk so
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's important and and that's
 
03:14:26.790 --> 03:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
why I suggested at the very beginning
 
03:14:29.590 --> 03:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
that this issue is broader than just
 
03:14:32.469 --> 03:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
defining indigency there are going to be
 
03:14:34.830 --> 03:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
individuals no matter what that may have
 
03:14:38.110 --> 03:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
trouble coming up with documents that
 
03:14:40.349 --> 03:14:40.359 align:start position:0%
they may have lost got burned up in a
 
03:14:43.870 --> 03:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
fire or you know a wide variety of
 
03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
things that I think we're going to have
 
03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
to be willing to to help those
 
03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:50.910 align:start position:0%
to be willing to to help those
individuals

03:14:50.910 --> 03:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:54.070 --> 03:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
with further questions from the
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:14:59.150 --> 03:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you and thank you again for
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is this more of a
 
03:15:05.710 --> 03:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
a policy decision for the legislature to
 
03:15:11.550 --> 03:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
make is this a policy decision yes thank

another one for

03:16:09.309 --> 03:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
Taylor good afternoon members of the
 
03:16:11.710 --> 03:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
committee um McKenzie Taylor with New
 
03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign for voting rights and
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
America votes and we are uh testifying
 
03:16:18.830 --> 03:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
in opposition to house Bill 365 um this
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill attempts to create a system that
 
03:16:22.269 --> 03:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
would assist voters in providing
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
citizenship however as we've think
 
03:16:26.309 --> 03:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
already heard there this is not a system
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
that is going to be foolproof and the
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
best way to ensure that no voter is
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
turned away for lack of citizenship
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
documents specifically is to bring back
 
03:16:36.910 --> 03:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
the affidavit process and let voters
 
03:16:39.150 --> 03:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
attest their citizenship by sworting a
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
sworn Aid or signing a sworn affidavit
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
um as far as I understand no other state
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
um requires physical documentary proof
 
03:16:49.189 --> 03:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
of citizenship when registering there
 
03:16:50.910 --> 03:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
are other states that once folks are
 
03:16:53.469 --> 03:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
registered they might look backwards and
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
and try to confirm that citizenship but
 
03:16:57.750 --> 03:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only state where uh
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
when you are registering you need to
 
03:17:03.630 --> 03:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
have that document or be turned away um
 
03:17:05.469 --> 03:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
I know also that I think it's upwards of
 
03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
80% of Voters in New Hampshire probably
 
03:17:11.070 --> 03:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
changes a little bit via which election
 
03:17:13.950 --> 03:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
register in person at the polls on
 
03:17:16.349 --> 03:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
Election Day where even in the bill it
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
says it's not likely that we are able to
 
03:17:21.229 --> 03:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
take the time to find the citizenship
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
proof for most of those voters big
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
concern about having required
 
03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
documentary proof of citizenship is
 
03:17:28.269 --> 03:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
folks having to get to the polls with
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
that passport or birth certificate with
 
03:17:32.590 --> 03:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
them and then be it takes an hour two
 
03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
hours days to find their citizenship in
 
03:17:38.030 --> 03:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
those federal or state databases that is
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
not going to happen on election day and
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
those folks are therefore going to be
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
turned away um this doesn't solve the
 
03:17:45.550 --> 03:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
issue of people not realizing that their
 
03:17:48.030 --> 03:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
real ID does not solve proof of show
 
03:17:50.870 --> 03:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship um and then as
 
03:17:52.389 --> 03:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
you've heard you know this is the
 
03:17:54.189 --> 03:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State say this is really
 
03:17:56.550 --> 03:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
only for voters the the birth
 
03:17:58.110 --> 03:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
certificate process for voters who were
 
03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
born in New Hampshire um according to
 
03:18:03.790 --> 03:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
nhpr an article in 2019 about a third of
 
03:18:05.429 --> 03:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters were born in the
 
03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
state um so those folks have their birth
 
03:18:09.990 --> 03:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
certificates in state databases but the
 
03:18:12.830 --> 03:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
other 23s will need to go out of state
 
03:18:14.670 --> 03:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
often this is not just an issue of cost
 
03:18:17.189 --> 03:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
but of time weeks or months or systems
 
03:18:19.229 --> 03:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
to try to get those birth certificates
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
um that again are not going to be able
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
to be found on Election Day or in the
 
03:18:24.750 --> 03:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
days leading up to election day uh and
 
03:18:26.070 --> 03:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
finally when we're thinking about birth
 
03:18:28.469 --> 03:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
certificates wanted to note that uh they
 
03:18:30.070 --> 03:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't have correct names for every voter
 
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'm one person who is changing their
 
03:18:34.590 --> 03:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
name currently uh 79% of women when they
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
get married change their last name and
 
03:18:38.110 --> 03:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
for those voters they cannot use birth
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
certificates to show uh their full name
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
and proof of citizenship and I'm happy
 
03:18:45.750 --> 03:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
to take questions okay thank you uh will
 
03:18:47.790 --> 03:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
you take questions sure do we have any
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:18:52.910 --> 03:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:18:55.469 --> 03:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
Lane um thank you and thank you for
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I think you
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned this in previous testimony on
 
03:19:03.189 --> 03:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
a different bill but one of the reasons
 
03:19:05.309 --> 03:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding was one of the reasons
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a lot of problems
 
03:19:07.680 --> 03:19:09.030 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a lot of problems
with

03:19:09.030 --> 03:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:19:11.990 --> 03:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
non-citizens trying to get
 
03:19:14.670 --> 03:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
away and and fraud
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
defrauding uh registration is because
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's severe penalties if they do that
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
could you explain what those might be
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes my understanding when you sign an
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
affidavit generally there you're
 
03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
assigning that under um penalty of
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
perjury um it's also illegal to vote if
 
03:19:31.790 --> 03:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
you are not a citizen in New Hampshire
 
03:19:34.950 --> 03:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
so if you were to vote as not a citizen
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm not an attorney but I believe
 
03:19:38.229 --> 03:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
that you could be facing penalties
 
03:19:40.229 --> 03:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
including deportation for doing that
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
since it's against the
 
03:19:42.840 --> 03:19:44.429 align:start position:0%
since it's against the
law

03:19:44.429 --> 03:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:19:48.630 --> 03:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
for representative Gilmore thank you um
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
am I correct in assuming that this is
 
03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
part of the HB 1569 that just went into
 
03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
effect after the election that change
 
03:19:59.590 --> 03:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
the change of needing documentary proof
 
03:20:02.229 --> 03:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
of citizenship was created with that
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill yeah thank
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Harvey
 
03:20:13.309 --> 03:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
Buller thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:20:15.630 --> 03:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I just wanted
 
03:20:17.750 --> 03:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
to quickly uh go back to what you're
 
03:20:20.389 --> 03:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
were saying about the other states I
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you were aware that there
 
03:20:24.670 --> 03:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
are about 26 other states um that
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
require photo ID is that what you were
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
saying not photo thank you for the
 
03:20:30.269 --> 03:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
question um I talking about proof of
 
03:20:31.870 --> 03:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
citizenship which is what we're talking
 
03:20:33.790 --> 03:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
about in this bill in terms of you know
 
03:20:35.630 --> 03:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
a photo ID lots of states need you need
 
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but a birth certificate
 
03:20:40.750 --> 03:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
naturalization papers or passport
 
03:20:42.630 --> 03:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
especially when registering to vote as a
 
03:20:45.550 --> 03:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
proactive like documentary proof um as
 
03:20:46.870 --> 03:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
far as I understand at this point Point
 
03:20:49.590 --> 03:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
only New Hampshire has that requirement
 
03:20:51.790 --> 03:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
other states might look it up afterwards
 
03:20:54.269 --> 03:20:54.279 align:start position:0%
to prove it but um we're the only state
 
03:20:55.630 --> 03:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
where when you go in and register in
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
person now if you don't have that
 
03:20:59.950 --> 03:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
document for citizenship with you um
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to be turned
 
03:21:05.269 --> 03:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
away and I to add a real ID um does not
 
03:21:07.309 --> 03:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
prove citizenship as well that is a
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
thing to note further questions from the
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
03:21:13.439 --> 03:21:17.910 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
much

03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.750 --> 03:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:30.590 --> 03:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
zinc good afternoon um for the record my
 
03:21:32.349 --> 03:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
name is Olivia zenc a voter in Franklin
 
03:21:35.110 --> 03:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
and executive director of um open
 
03:21:37.229 --> 03:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
democracy I wish I I wish there was an
 
03:21:40.469 --> 03:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
option to say I wish we could do better
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh so I do think that this is a good
 
03:21:46.590 --> 03:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
first step in you know making it a
 
03:21:49.189 --> 03:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
available for people uh to be able to
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
vote but if you're going to take an
 
03:21:54.590 --> 03:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
affidavit that says I swear I'm
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
poor why don't you just take the
 
03:21:58.229 --> 03:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
affidavit that says I swear I'm a
 
03:22:01.710 --> 03:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
citizen right that it just makes me
 
03:22:04.110 --> 03:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
think oh people should just swear on an
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
affidavit that says I'm a citizen we
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
accept that proof and not make them sign
 
03:22:12.630 --> 03:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
an affid David that says I'm poor so
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
that they can get a voucher to get a get
 
03:22:17.070 --> 03:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
their birth certificate
 
03:22:20.070 --> 03:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
um we also have people that are adopted
 
03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
who may not be have the same name as
 
03:22:24.510 --> 03:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
their birth certificate so then do they
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
need the adoption certificate married
 
03:22:29.389 --> 03:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
women who Chang their names will they
 
03:22:31.630 --> 03:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
require marriage certificates will the
 
03:22:34.030 --> 03:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
state help get marriage certificates or
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
only the birth certificate but if the
 
03:22:37.269 --> 03:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
birth certificate doesn't have the same
 
03:22:39.150 --> 03:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
name because their marriage certificate
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
changed now now that voter still is
 
03:22:44.550 --> 03:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised so I think uh your
 
03:22:46.990 --> 03:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
better bet is to just allow them
 
03:22:49.590 --> 03:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
an affidavit to swear citizenship and
 
03:22:51.429 --> 03:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
not have an affidavit that swears their
 
03:22:55.349 --> 03:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
poor also what what what does this
 
03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of this so can can
 
03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
anyone say they're poor and sign a piece
 
03:23:00.680 --> 03:23:02.150 align:start position:0%
anyone say they're poor and sign a piece
of

03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
paper I think that that we there's no
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
clarification on that um also we're only
 
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
allocating $25,000 for birth certificate
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
vouchers from the Secretary of State
 
03:23:16.590 --> 03:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
what happens to the person who might be
 
03:23:19.510 --> 03:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
that sort of the person that goes over
 
03:23:21.229 --> 03:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
that threshold if that dollar amount has
 
03:23:23.229 --> 03:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
already spent will we allocate a few
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
more dollars if if needed or or do we
 
03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
just cut that off at
 
03:23:30.590 --> 03:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
$25,000 um for those reasons I urge the
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee to vote
 
03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:36.520 align:start position:0%

um didn't participate in that one
 
03:24:57.469 --> 03:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
because I was in and out of the room and
 
03:24:58.750 --> 03:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'm on the bill and I was just like it's
 
03:25:01.389 --> 03:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
best just to let the uh the VC Captain
 
03:25:04.590 --> 03:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
the ship for a minute um so on the blue
 
03:25:08.830 --> 03:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
sheet for 365 we had one in favor nine
 
03:25:12.750 --> 03:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
opposed um signed up who did not speak
 
03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then online 365
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
was uh 48 support 421 oppose one neutral
 
03:25:21.030 --> 03:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the public
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 365 FN and open
 
03:25:28.269 --> 03:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 472
 
03:25:33.670 --> 03:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:41.550 --> 03:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:49.830 --> 03:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
um I'll allow it yes since did you when
 
03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.309 --> 03:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
card oh so the blue sheet okay very
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
common mistake it's okay uh blue sheet
 
03:25:59.070 --> 03:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
is you're signed up you're not signing
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
up to speak You're Just signing in your
 
03:26:03.469 --> 03:26:03.479 align:start position:0%

03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%

03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%

Phil Hatcher I'm from Dober it's very
 
03:26:38.349 --> 03:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
nice to see two of my own reps on this
 
03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee today um I've worked in
 
03:26:43.309 --> 03:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
various roles in do W 3 polling place
 
03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
since 2019 um uh right currently I am
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
the award 3 award clerk um during those
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
five or six years I've worked with two
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
City Clerks uh who have repeatly told me
 
03:27:01.070 --> 03:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
they don't see evidence of voting fraud
 
03:27:03.870 --> 03:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
in our city um this agrees with what
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
I've been told by other election
 
03:27:09.429 --> 03:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
officials around the state and also
 
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
agrees with the final report of the
 
03:27:12.910 --> 03:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's special committee
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
on voter confidence but for that reason
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
I was opposed to HP
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
1569 when it was under discussion last
 
03:27:23.710 --> 03:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
spring and was disappointed to see it
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
passed into
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
law um it seemed to me that that was a
 
03:27:29.830 --> 03:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
extreme uh solution to a problem that
 
03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist um and one that will
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
likely disenfranchise some voters this
 
03:27:39.990 --> 03:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
seems even more true
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
today with all uh due respect to the
 
03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State I don't see a you
 
03:27:47.150 --> 03:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
know a concentrated public
 
03:27:48.670 --> 03:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
announcement of this major change in
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
election law being propagated out to the
 
03:27:52.110 --> 03:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
public so I'm worried about people
 
03:27:54.830 --> 03:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
showing up next month to vote in their M
 
03:27:57.229 --> 03:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
elections and being surprised that this
 
03:27:58.510 --> 03:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
is in
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
effect um so in fact I want to thank the
 
03:28:05.229 --> 03:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
sponsors of HP 365 for apparently
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there are flaws in the
 
03:28:10.750 --> 03:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed last year and now
 
03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:12.630 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed last year and now
seeking

03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
remediation um and it's it's encouraging
 
03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
that they're so prominent
 
03:28:18.110 --> 03:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
themselves the two chairs of the
 
03:28:19.550 --> 03:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
election law committees plus the
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
original sponsor of the bill um but I
 
03:28:26.790 --> 03:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't think HB 365 is an effective
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
remedy uh echoing some of what people
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
have said before um but in particular it
 
03:28:35.150 --> 03:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
won't help voters who are registering on
 
03:28:37.030 --> 03:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
Election Day at least it doesn't
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
guarantee much
 
03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
help um which perhaps reflects that New
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no longer is going to have an
 
03:28:46.750 --> 03:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
effective election day registration
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
system as required by federal law since
 
03:28:52.550 --> 03:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
the state took a pass on Motor Voter way
 
03:28:55.150 --> 03:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
back when
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
um in addition as secretary himself
 
03:29:02.110 --> 03:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
alluded um the ability of this secretary
 
03:29:05.110 --> 03:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
state's office to help voters prove in
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
particular their citizenship is is
 
03:29:09.469 --> 03:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
dubious at this point in
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
time um in a February 9th article in the
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
Washington Post the Republican
 
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
secretaries of state of Iowa and Ohio
 
03:29:17.790 --> 03:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
are quoted complaining about the
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty in getting accurate
 
03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
citizenship data from the federal
 
03:29:23.229 --> 03:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
government sir I'm not to ask you to
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
bring your marks to conclusion that your
 
03:29:26.429 --> 03:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
time has expired these complaints have
 
03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
been echoed in recent years by many
 
03:29:30.389 --> 03:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
Democrats complaining about e
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
verify so if hb65 has passed I'm afraid
 
03:29:35.309 --> 03:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have three divisions of
 
03:29:37.229 --> 03:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
Voters those who have already access to
 
03:29:40.229 --> 03:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
their documents those who don't but this
 
03:29:42.429 --> 03:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State can help and everyone
 
03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
else is out of luck um and in fact this
 
03:29:47.790 --> 03:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
differentiation between voters is why we
 
03:29:49.349 --> 03:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
have a citizenship affidavit in the
 
03:29:51.309 --> 03:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
first place if you go back and look at
 
03:29:53.710 --> 03:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
the law and I I'll refer you since my
 
03:29:55.630 --> 03:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
time is expiring to representative
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
Gilmore who despite his youthful
 
03:29:59.229 --> 03:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
appearance actually served on the
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
election law committee when a citizen
 
03:30:03.630 --> 03:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
affidavit was put into effect again
 
03:30:05.150 --> 03:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify
 
03:30:07.189 --> 03:30:07.199 align:start position:0%

03:30:10.590 --> 03:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you no worries um qu we

03:30:15.269 --> 03:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
are the questions from the committee
 
03:30:17.150 --> 03:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank thank you going to
 
03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
reclose the public testimony on House
 
03:30:22.110 --> 03:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 365 going to open the public
 
03:30:24.790 --> 03:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 472 and recognize
 
03:30:34.510 --> 03:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:34.520 --> 03:30:36.150 align:start position:0%
 
introduction

03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
03:30:39.030 --> 03:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
oops sorry thank you Mr chair uh for the
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
record representative Kelly Penza
 
03:30:43.030 --> 03:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
straford District 19 I have another
 
03:30:45.070 --> 03:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
hearing that I have to be at uh that
 
03:30:47.950 --> 03:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
goes at 1:30 so uh this is a very simple
 
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill um that basically it's the same
 
03:30:53.950 --> 03:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
thing uh similar to what was put forward
 
03:30:57.750 --> 03:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
in regards with um an IDE identification
 
03:31:01.550 --> 03:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
bill um voters have need need two pieces
 
03:31:03.870 --> 03:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
and um of course we need to know we have
 
03:31:06.150 --> 03:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
to verify their identity and we also
 
03:31:08.510 --> 03:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
have to verify that they actually um are
 
03:31:11.710 --> 03:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
do ailed here in New Hampshire so um
 
03:31:14.830 --> 03:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
basically um when I moved from one
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
section of Rochester to another I had to
 
03:31:20.389 --> 03:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
prove that I did and I brought in my my
 
03:31:23.790 --> 03:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
lease for um where we live and every
 
03:31:26.469 --> 03:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
voter should be have to do that so it's
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple um and of course uh
 
03:31:31.870 --> 03:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
from a friend of mine that is a
 
03:31:35.469 --> 03:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist this past uh
 
03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
election it was um quite crazy and there
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
was things that were rushed through
 
03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
where um where there wasn't you know
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
necess neily a proof of residency of
 
03:31:48.750 --> 03:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
domicile because it was you know there
 
03:31:51.269 --> 03:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
were long lines and all of that so this
 
03:31:53.110 --> 03:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
puts it into statute and makes it
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that in addition to
 
03:31:57.150 --> 03:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
approving your identity you also have to
 
03:31:58.990 --> 03:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
prove that you reside here in domiciled
 
03:31:59.950 --> 03:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
in New
 
03:32:02.030 --> 03:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to
 
03:32:04.030 --> 03:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
vote will you be taking questions from
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
the committee can I not yeah absolutely
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
you cannot in fact that's my preference
 
03:32:13.389 --> 03:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
um so all right easy enough thank you um
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
next up is Secretary of State David
 
03:32:15.120 --> 03:32:22.910 align:start position:0%
next up is Secretary of State David
scanland

03:32:22.910 --> 03:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:24.469 --> 03:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:32:26.469 --> 03:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David scanland Secretary
 
03:32:28.910 --> 03:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
of State and I just wanted to raise some
 
03:32:32.349 --> 03:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
concerns that I had with this piece of
 
03:32:34.110 --> 03:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
legislation and I've shared these
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with representative Penza so
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
she's she is aware of them um the
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
check-in process for a voter now
 
03:32:46.630 --> 03:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
requires that a voter show their
 
03:32:48.269 --> 03:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
acceptable form of
 
03:32:51.630 --> 03:32:51.640 align:start position:0%
ID and once that's done the ballot
 
03:32:55.469 --> 03:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
clerks will then ask the voter if their
 
03:32:59.070 --> 03:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
address is still XYZ Main
 
03:33:02.269 --> 03:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
Street uh if it is not the voter simply
 
03:33:05.750 --> 03:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
gives the new address to the ballot
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
clerk who then writes the the new
 
03:33:11.950 --> 03:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
address in red ink on the uh on the on
 
03:33:11.960 --> 03:33:13.910 align:start position:0%
address in red ink on the uh on the on
the

03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:33:16.110 --> 03:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
checklist the reason for that is so the
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
supervisors can just keep their lists up
 
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
to date they'll take that information
 
03:33:21.309 --> 03:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
and they'll correct the checklist at a
 
03:33:24.630 --> 03:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
later time there is no requirement in
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
the statute that a voter has to prove
 
03:33:30.910 --> 03:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
their domicile at the same time they're
 
03:33:33.870 --> 03:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
checking in just to get a ballot that
 
03:33:36.990 --> 03:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
process takes place when the voter
 
03:33:39.550 --> 03:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
registers with the supervisors of the
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
checklist and now under state law that
 
03:33:45.910 --> 03:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
docum that documentation has to be
 
03:33:49.870 --> 03:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
provided when that event happens and so
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
what is happening here is kind of
 
03:33:55.590 --> 03:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
conflation of the different uh processes
 
03:33:58.670 --> 03:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
that take place and if the process in
 
03:33:59.870 --> 03:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:34:03.630 --> 03:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
472 were to pass it would be somewhat
 
03:34:07.189 --> 03:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
chaotic uh when people are checking in
 
03:34:09.510 --> 03:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh not having the document that they
 
03:34:11.550 --> 03:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
need having to go over to the
 
03:34:14.150 --> 03:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist for some
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
type of a verification it's just going
 
03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
to cause lines to back up and on a day
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
like we had last
 
03:34:25.510 --> 03:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
November uh it could be a disaster so
 
03:34:27.429 --> 03:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
that's the concern I have is that we
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
have distinct processes that take place
 
03:34:33.910 --> 03:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
they both work really well and we should
 
03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
not do anything that is going to cause
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
confusion in that process so with that
 
03:34:40.990 --> 03:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:34:43.229 --> 03:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
questions other questions from the
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um next
 
03:34:49.830 --> 03:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
up trying to do members of the public
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
here think I only have one member of the
 
03:35:06.750 --> 03:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford hello yeah I'm suasi from
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford and I wanted to say that
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
when a voter registered
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
the domicile is verified at that point
 
03:35:23.429 --> 03:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
as secretary scandin said it's
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
verified and by the town or city clerk
 
03:35:27.160 --> 03:35:28.389 align:start position:0%
verified and by the town or city clerk
or

03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
supervisor and all information per voter
 
03:35:34.870 --> 03:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
is saved online which is available to
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
the ballot clerk on Election Day and
 
03:35:42.510 --> 03:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
checked with um the ID when uh the voter
 
03:35:46.990 --> 03:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
wants to get a ballot and um uh what I
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
see is that there isn't any need for
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
this bill when I verified um my own
 
03:35:57.790 --> 03:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
doile it was like a day after our house
 
03:36:01.189 --> 03:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
closing and I brought in our uh closing
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
papers right to the town clerk and it
 
03:36:09.070 --> 03:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
stayed right there and um it's been the
 
03:36:13.030 --> 03:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
same and so far as uh having to
 
03:36:16.189 --> 03:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
verify um domicile
 
03:36:16.199 --> 03:36:17.429 align:start position:0%
verify um domicile
um

03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
again um uh I I don't see the need
 
03:36:26.950 --> 03:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
because it's online and plus uh checking
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
that when the voter comes on Election
 
03:36:32.469 --> 03:36:32.479 align:start position:0%

Trend in this legislative session a
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%

individuals with disabilities this
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
session alone we have witnessed an
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
alarming number of bills designed to
 
03:37:37.870 --> 03:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
impose additional barriers to voting
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
hp472 is a prime example introducing
 
03:37:42.790 --> 03:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
onerous requirements for proving
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
domicile that disproportionately affect
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
voters with disabilities low-income
 
03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
individuals and those in non-traditional
 
03:37:52.189 --> 03:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
housing situations many disabled voters
 
03:37:53.790 --> 03:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
reside with family members or in
 
03:37:55.590 --> 03:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities and do not
 
03:37:58.229 --> 03:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
possess documents like utility bills or
 
03:38:01.710 --> 03:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
leases in their names this bill fails to
 
03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
consider their realities effectively
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising eligible voters the
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
current system already mandates that
 
03:38:11.910 --> 03:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
voters provide domicile
 
03:38:14.670 --> 03:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
hp472 seeks to complicate this process
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
further granting election officials
 
03:38:19.269 --> 03:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
undue discretion to reject voters based
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
on arbitrary standards if a voter's
 
03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
residency is challenged their only
 
03:38:26.309 --> 03:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
recourse is to appeal immediately to the
 
03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
Superior Court a daunting and often
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
unfeasible option for individuals with
 
03:38:33.510 --> 03:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
Mobility challenges cognitive
 
03:38:36.790 --> 03:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities or limited access to Legal
 
03:38:38.910 --> 03:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
resources the sheer number of
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
restrictive voting bills introduce the
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
session is not only disheartening but
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's also infuriating it reflects a
 
03:38:47.630 --> 03:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
persistent attempt to erode the
 
03:38:50.269 --> 03:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
accessibility and inclusivity of our de
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
Democratic process instead of erecting
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
barriers we should be enacting policies
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
that facilitate participation for all
 
03:38:59.229 --> 03:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
eligible voters ensuring that everyone
 
03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
can exercise their fundamental right to
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
vote with dignity and ease hp472 is an
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
affront to the principle of fairness and
 
03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
equality it does nothing to enhance
 
03:39:12.030 --> 03:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
election security but serves only to
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise those who already face
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
significant obstacles I urge this
 
03:39:17.830 --> 03:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee to reject this harmful
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and affirm your commitment
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
to protecting the voting rights of all
 
03:39:24.590 --> 03:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
Granite St Staters especially to those
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
who are the most vulnerable thank you
 
03:39:28.510 --> 03:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you nobody taking questions yes
 
03:39:30.269 --> 03:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you next up
 
03:39:32.760 --> 03:39:34.349 align:start position:0%

03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
Iris I was GNA get there sorry no I
 
03:39:39.550 --> 03:39:39.560 align:start position:0%

going to stare at it and and hope I'm
 
03:39:44.750 --> 03:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
used to it before I was married it was
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
worse so thank you committee for taking
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony today my name
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
is Iris altilio I am from Penbrook New
 
03:39:54.990 --> 03:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm speaking as a citizen as a
 
03:39:57.309 --> 03:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
senior citizen and a representative of
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
ARP so I'm wearing my red I'm also
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
speaking as a supervisor of the
 
03:40:04.349 --> 03:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
checklist and I recently retired from
 
03:40:05.710 --> 03:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
the conquered coalition to end
 
03:40:07.229 --> 03:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
homelessness so I understand the
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
problems of the homeless as well um also
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate what you do because I
 
03:40:14.590 --> 03:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
was the committee assistant for this
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee prior to to covid so I'm very
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with your job um I'm speaking
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
against this bill and I'm speaking
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
against this bill because first of all
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's confusing I don't remember the name
 
03:40:28.990 --> 03:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor because I'm old but she
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
did say that this bill was related to a
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
person and it almost sounded like
 
03:40:37.469 --> 03:40:37.479 align:start position:0%
registering not voting and then the
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State who I can who I agree
 
03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
with said seemed to say that this bill
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
requires everybody to provide proof of
 
03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
doic when they walk up to the ballot
 
03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
clerk but when I looked at the bill it
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
sounded like only people who don't have
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
ID have to provide proof of Dell so
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
right away I don't know what this bill
 
03:40:58.429 --> 03:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
is doing so it's hard to speak to it
 
03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
however as everybody said it is very
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
difficult now for people to register to
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
vote if they don't have their ID um at
 
03:41:09.150 --> 03:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
this point it's going to disenfranchise
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise some voters um and then
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
again I'm going to ask what's the
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
probability how many of you walk around
 
03:41:17.389 --> 03:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
with your deed or your lease in your
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
hand probably not most of you so it's
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
not that practical either so as a
 
03:41:25.149 --> 03:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist my job is to
 
03:41:27.389 --> 03:41:27.399 align:start position:0%
maintain accurate voting records to
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
maintain the Integrity of the elections
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
and to encourage voting this is not
 
03:41:34.149 --> 03:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
going to encourage voting and it's
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
probably not going to really do the best
 
03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
job of maintaining the Integrity of the
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
elections either and that's because the
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
way I read this if you don't have ID you
 
03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
can go you can uce your proof of
 
03:41:49.229 --> 03:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
domicile and you're allowed to vote so
 
03:41:51.149 --> 03:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
you're voting without ID now I could be
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
totally wrong so please read the bill
 
03:41:54.990 --> 03:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
and you know check it out and see what
 
03:41:57.630 --> 03:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
you say by the way I do have testimony I
 
03:41:58.950 --> 03:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
put some more information in my
 
03:42:00.429 --> 03:42:00.439 align:start position:0%
testimony I didn't want to speak that
 
03:42:02.590 --> 03:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
long so it's not in here excellent thank
 
03:42:04.590 --> 03:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
you um I do want to say a couple more
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
things well your time has expired ma'am
 
03:42:07.870 --> 03:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
so I need you to oh it's more than three
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
minutes okay it's two minutes oh I'm
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't realize I had two minutes
 
03:42:13.469 --> 03:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
okay so then I just want to wrap up
 
03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
really quickly and um say I really do
 
03:42:19.389 --> 03:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
hope that you look at this bill see that
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's it is confusing and please um do
 
03:42:24.790 --> 03:42:24.800 align:start position:0%

03:43:03.070 --> 03:43:03.080 align:start position:0%

um thank you chairman Barry and members
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is kayy of
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
stadio I'm a Durham voter and public
 
03:43:25.550 --> 03:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
policy fellow with open democracy and
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying today in opposition to
 
03:43:29.870 --> 03:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
this bill um I feel it places an
 
03:43:31.710 --> 03:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden on both voters who
 
03:43:32.910 --> 03:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
have already shown proof of their
 
03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
domicile at the time they registered as
 
03:43:37.030 --> 03:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
well as on checklist supervisors who as
 
03:43:38.670 --> 03:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
we all know are already swamped on
 
03:43:40.510 --> 03:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
Election Day seeing that this
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
requirement is not currently employed by
 
03:43:44.229 --> 03:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
any other state in the country the
 
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
reality is that the effects of HB 472
 
03:43:48.670 --> 03:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
would largely go unnoticed by the
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
majority of granite Staters until it is
 
03:43:52.750 --> 03:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
way too late I Envision this leading to
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
mass confusion and congestion on already
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
busy election days as voters who show up
 
03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
with the wellestablished photo ID
 
03:44:00.990 --> 03:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
requirement but no proof of domicile at
 
03:44:03.149 --> 03:44:03.159 align:start position:0%
the ready line up for the supervisor of
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
the checklist to individually review
 
03:44:06.870 --> 03:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
each of their qualifications and
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
identity RSA 65913 currently requires
 
03:44:12.269 --> 03:44:12.279 align:start position:0%
voters to provide a valid form of photo
 
03:44:14.510 --> 03:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
ID ensuring an accurate and efficient
 
03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
voter check system needlessly
 
03:44:18.670 --> 03:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
double-checking proof of Voters domicile
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
when it has already been established
 
03:44:22.189 --> 03:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
will only work to lengthen the tiring
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
weight in line on election days spur
 
03:44:26.349 --> 03:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
controversy between ballot clerks and
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
voters and create yet another hurdle
 
03:44:30.429 --> 03:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
Grant Staters must jump in order to
 
03:44:32.590 --> 03:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
enact their constitutional right to vote
 
03:44:34.830 --> 03:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons I urge you to vote
 
03:44:38.229 --> 03:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
hb42 and expedient to legislate I also
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of testimony on behalf
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
of Susan Moore she is a supervisor of
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
the checklist from Franconia she urges
 
03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
you as well to oppose this bill um she
 
03:44:49.830 --> 03:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
says without question this is a voter
 
03:44:51.510 --> 03:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
suppression bill every voter on the
 
03:44:53.389 --> 03:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
voter list has had to prove domicile in
 
03:44:55.870 --> 03:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
order to register to vote the new
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
requirement presented in this bill would
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
mean that voters who do not have their
 
03:45:00.790 --> 03:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
current address on their ID would need
 
03:45:02.269 --> 03:45:02.279 align:start position:0%
additional documents to receive the
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
ballots the voters will be sent to the
 
03:45:05.710 --> 03:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist and these
 
03:45:07.149 --> 03:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
voters would need to have proof of
 
03:45:08.990 --> 03:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
residency domicile consisting of a
 
03:45:11.550 --> 03:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
utility bill lease deed or similar
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
documentation of the voter's domicile
 
03:45:15.950 --> 03:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
address it is highly unlikely residents
 
03:45:17.550 --> 03:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
who have voted in Prior elections would
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
have these documents with them and we
 
03:45:21.469 --> 03:45:21.479 align:start position:0%
would have to turn them away as a
 
03:45:23.149 --> 03:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist I can
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
foresee big problems if this becomes the
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
new law I would also note that the
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
reference to an appeal to the Superior
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
Court does not appear to site the
 
03:45:33.269 --> 03:45:33.279 align:start position:0%

votes and the New Hampshire campaign for

voting rights um a lot has been already
 
03:46:09.149 --> 03:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
said in opposition to this bill so I
 
03:46:11.590 --> 03:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
will be very brief um reminding folks
 
03:46:14.349 --> 03:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
that again folks are show their domicile
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh andove that with documents when they
 
03:46:17.950 --> 03:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
register to vote and then are just
 
03:46:19.550 --> 03:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
showing their identity when they are
 
03:46:22.469 --> 03:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
checking in to vote um I'm one of the
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
many New Hampshire voters probably who
 
03:46:26.510 --> 03:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
at some point did not have their current
 
03:46:28.870 --> 03:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
address on their license um when I moved
 
03:46:30.790 --> 03:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
in 2019 from my apartment to my current
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
house I updated my address with the DMV
 
03:46:36.910 --> 03:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
but did not get a new license and from
 
03:46:39.630 --> 03:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
2019 until 20124 I think the
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
presidential primary I voted and checked
 
03:46:43.790 --> 03:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
in with that license that had an old
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
address on it which was compliant I
 
03:46:48.790 --> 03:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
confirmed my updated address and went on
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
my way um if I had if this Bill had been
 
03:46:52.990 --> 03:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
in effect I would have had to bring a
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
separate document my car registration I
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
normally walk to the polls it live very
 
03:46:59.030 --> 03:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
close by um and I think that is a story
 
03:47:01.710 --> 03:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
that could be uh affected by or happened
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
to many many voters if this bill was
 
03:47:06.189 --> 03:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
passed um and is unnecessary and only is
 
03:47:09.550 --> 03:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
going to um result in longer lines for
 
03:47:10.910 --> 03:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
people when they're checking in
 
03:47:13.189 --> 03:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
confusion and uh folks potentially being
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
turned away so and I'm happy to to take
 
03:47:17.070 --> 03:47:17.080 align:start position:0%

03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
House Bill 172 restricting Undeclared
 
03:48:26.149 --> 03:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
voters from voting in presidential or
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
state primaries and I'm going to
 
03:48:29.309 --> 03:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
recognize representative sellers for the
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of introduction representative
 
03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
law thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:48:38.149 --> 03:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
committee members for giving me a few
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
minutes uh to introduce this bill on
 
03:48:43.630 --> 03:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative cellers from Grafton 10
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
which represents Bristol Bridgewater in
 
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill uh HB 172 of course
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
I support it and it's a very simple
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
change and it uh as you can see it's
 
03:48:57.149 --> 03:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
about three lines so I don't think I
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
need to read it but what I want to point
 
03:49:01.469 --> 03:49:01.479 align:start position:0%
out is a few things and and one of the
 
03:49:04.229 --> 03:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
things is uh you you all had I believe
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
you all get a letter from uh
 
03:49:10.510 --> 03:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
a Robert
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
B bille in any case he he actually says
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
the same thing thing I would be saying
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to say it twice and he
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
probably says it better than I do and I
 
03:49:22.469 --> 03:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
just want to point out a few items here
 
03:49:26.030 --> 03:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
all right he says um House Bill 172 will
 
03:49:29.950 --> 03:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
correct the confusion in IG
 
03:49:33.670 --> 03:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
IG that uh currently exist in our State
 
03:49:37.269 --> 03:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
statue all right and uh what the prim it
 
03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
goes on to say regarding the uh
 
03:49:42.670 --> 03:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
participation and non-member of
 
03:49:46.110 --> 03:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
political party election in should be
 
03:49:49.750 --> 03:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
partially closed primary system and then
 
03:49:51.870 --> 03:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
he goes and quotes our
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
RSA um 659 col
 
03:49:57.429 --> 03:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
141 and I'm just going to read the very
 
03:49:59.550 --> 03:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
last part of that it says the the
 
03:50:02.590 --> 03:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
primary shell also announce the name of
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
the party at the time of announcing the
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
person's name and basically we're saying
 
03:50:13.149 --> 03:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
here the person has to be in the party
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
all right has to be in the party in
 
03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
order to you order to be in the primary
 
03:50:19.550 --> 03:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
to vote in that party's
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
election and it goes on to say three
 
03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
things the bill does it eliminates
 
03:50:26.790 --> 03:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
eliminates the same day registration by
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
Undeclared it requires Undeclared to
 
03:50:31.710 --> 03:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
register with the Party by the same
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
deadline as regular party members and it
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
continues to allow new and firsttime
 
03:50:40.950 --> 03:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
voters to register uh to vote in the
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
primary so that part doesn't change so
 
03:50:45.389 --> 03:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
if it new or first time time you can
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
still register on the primary
 
03:50:52.830 --> 03:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
day um another thing I'll point out
 
03:50:55.510 --> 03:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
here is a basic uh function of the
 
03:50:58.429 --> 03:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
political party is to um elect select
 
03:51:00.670 --> 03:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
the candidate for the public office to
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
be offered to the voters at the general
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
election into the prime Obed to of most
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
voters in associate themselves with the
 
03:51:11.950 --> 03:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
primary party must securely be to gain a
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
voice in The Selection process so the
 
03:51:19.469 --> 03:51:19.479 align:start position:0%
idea our primary is to select one or
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
even two people if they're if you're
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
being Primary in the primary to that
 
03:51:27.189 --> 03:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
point is coming from that party and that
 
03:51:28.229 --> 03:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't matter if it's
 
03:51:30.429 --> 03:51:30.439 align:start position:0%
Republican or Democrat you should be
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to select who you want and what
 
03:51:35.790 --> 03:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
happens is the and and I've seen it
 
03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
happen and I know it happens is on
 
03:51:40.950 --> 03:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
primary day um maybe the other party has
 
03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
a strong candidate so the person in that
 
03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
party will actually literally go and
 
03:51:47.349 --> 03:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
register for the other party and they're
 
03:51:50.710 --> 03:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
Undeclared so they normally might vote
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
one way but they decided on this primary
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
to vote another way and it actually um
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
skews who actually
 
03:52:01.149 --> 03:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
gets elected to go forward for the prime
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh for the
 
03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:06.309 align:start position:0%
uh for the
general

03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:09.309 --> 03:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
um one other thing is this writer said
 
03:52:11.309 --> 03:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
he said many opponents of the bill say
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
that this violates their constitutional
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
rights and will dis franchise
 
03:52:19.110 --> 03:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
Undeclared uh voters from voting in the
 
03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
primaries again he he mentions here the
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court says otherwise it's a b
 
03:52:29.550 --> 03:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
election versus Lopez Torres 552 us 196
 
03:52:31.830 --> 03:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
commer 202-
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
03 uh parentheses 2008 the courot said a
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
political party has the First Amendment
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
right to limmit the membership as it
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
wishes and to choose a candidate select
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
process that will in its uh view produce
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
the nominee that best represents the
 
03:52:50.720 --> 03:52:51.910 align:start position:0%
the nominee that best represents the
political

03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
political
 
03:52:55.149 --> 03:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
platform so along with
 
03:52:58.149 --> 03:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
that this would be no different than the
 
03:53:00.030 --> 03:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
Red Sox playing the
 
03:53:02.550 --> 03:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
Yankees and the Red Sox telling the
 
03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
Yankees hey by the way you're going to
 
03:53:07.750 --> 03:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
use this picture today against us so and
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want that so I'm going to
 
03:53:12.189 --> 03:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
leave it there just give you an idea and
 
03:53:15.189 --> 03:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
there is another bill hb2 20 that you're
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing and that bill there
 
03:53:21.070 --> 03:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
will actually allow the party to make
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
the rules just thought they're in
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%

03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
just a few days ago I reached the legal
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
voting age as soon as my schedule

permits I intend to register to vote as
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
an independent voter I oppose this bill
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
precisely because it prevents exactly
 
03:54:03.550 --> 03:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
what I intend to do when participating
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
in primary elections the ability to swap
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
my party affiliation at will gives me
 
03:54:10.149 --> 03:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
the option to vote in whichever primary
 
03:54:11.870 --> 03:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
contains the candidates who support the
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
same views and principles as me please
 
03:54:15.790 --> 03:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
don't take this option away from
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
independent voters please vote itl on HB
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%

03:54:47.870 --> 03:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
hello okay suasi from Rollinsford and
 
03:54:54.349 --> 03:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
this bill restricting Undeclared voters
 
03:54:57.149 --> 03:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
from same day voting in a presidential
 
03:55:00.030 --> 03:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
or state primary this bill purposely
 
03:55:04.189 --> 03:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
cuts out about 40% of the state's
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
voters in the bill description of change
 
03:55:10.469 --> 03:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
of registration or same day
 
03:55:13.750 --> 03:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
registration um that can't be acceptable
 
03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
when those
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
um Undeclared or independent they
 
03:55:20.710 --> 03:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
they're registered as
 
03:55:24.389 --> 03:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
Undeclared and um register without a
 
03:55:24.399 --> 03:55:26.550 align:start position:0%
Undeclared and um register without a
party

03:55:26.550 --> 03:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
party
 
03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
affiliation and I also look at it as be
 
03:55:31.389 --> 03:55:31.399 align:start position:0%
free to
 
03:55:33.870 --> 03:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
vote as the voter
 
03:55:36.910 --> 03:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
wishes and that is so important
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
especially in this
 
03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
state and um so I I really oppose this
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
bill and should not go past the
 
03:55:48.269 --> 03:55:48.279 align:start position:0%

03:56:04.149 --> 03:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
Coleman hi Liz tentarelli from
 
03:56:06.550 --> 03:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm testifying simply on
 
03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
myself um and I have been an Undeclared
 
03:56:13.710 --> 03:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
voter here in New Hampshire for 25 years
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I want to continue that I look at
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
the candidates who are running and I
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
decide that that time when I'm going
 
03:56:25.469 --> 03:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
which party I'm going to vote for if
 
03:56:27.910 --> 03:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
this bill passes I would have to choose
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
the party before I even know who the
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
candidates are and I have voted for
 
03:56:36.990 --> 03:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
State Rep state senator executive
 
03:56:39.149 --> 03:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
counselors depending on who the
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
candidates are their
 
03:56:43.110 --> 03:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications and how closely they
 
03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
match my values
 
03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
not by their party I'm not the only
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
person who does this we've got 40% of
 
03:56:51.910 --> 03:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
the voters as Sue mentioned in New
 
03:56:54.550 --> 03:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are Undeclared and I
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
believe that if we want to retain the
 
03:56:58.750 --> 03:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the first in the nation
 
03:57:01.550 --> 03:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
primary where voters are really looking
 
03:57:05.149 --> 03:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
at the candidates not party affiliation
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
when they vote then you're going to have
 
03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
to itel this bill and I'm not taking
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
questions on that thank
 
03:57:16.149 --> 03:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
you okay next up is Tiani Coleman on
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:27.309 --> 03:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
zinc hello this is Tiani Coleman and I
 
03:57:30.030 --> 03:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
am a resident of Amherst New Hampshire
 
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
and today I'm here as myself a citizen
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
who is an independent voter as well as
 
03:57:37.750 --> 03:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
president of New Hampshire independent
 
03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
voters uh first off as has been said
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 40% of
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
independent voters here in New Hampshire
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
which is a greater percentage than
 
03:57:50.309 --> 03:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
either the Democrat or the Republican
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
parties have so we are a a large number
 
03:57:58.349 --> 03:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
of Voters and we should not be told that
 
03:58:01.229 --> 03:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
we need to belong to a party in order to
 
03:58:04.710 --> 03:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
participate in a consequential election
 
03:58:06.830 --> 03:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
and since there are so many elections
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire where there are no
 
03:58:10.630 --> 03:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
third party choices there are no
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
independent candidates that means that a
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
lot of big decisions will be made in
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
primaries and if we're left out of the
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
primaries then it is actually not fair
 
03:58:23.630 --> 03:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
to us it's not equal protection under
 
03:58:28.950 --> 03:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
the law um we should not have to decide
 
03:58:30.189 --> 03:58:30.199 align:start position:0%
we should not have to decide and
 
03:58:33.229 --> 03:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
although the title of the bill is you
 
03:58:36.030 --> 03:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
know talking about same day registration
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
I hope that you won't let that fool you
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
because what this bill is actually doing
 
03:58:43.070 --> 03:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
is closing the primary it's the same
 
03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
thing as the other bill you have that's
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
closing the primary because if you do
 
03:58:48.910 --> 03:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
not let independent voters register at
 
03:58:51.189 --> 03:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
the party on the day of registration
 
03:58:52.910 --> 03:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
then that's the same as telling them
 
03:58:54.349 --> 03:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
they have to register with the party way
 
03:58:54.359 --> 03:58:55.189 align:start position:0%
they have to register with the party way
in

03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
advance uh also I don't know if it's
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
been mentioned but it's actually
 
03:59:02.110 --> 03:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional this bill for a
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
different reason it's unconstitutional
 
03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
because the Supreme Court at least up
 
03:59:10.950 --> 03:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
until now has said that parties do have
 
03:59:12.429 --> 03:59:12.439 align:start position:0%
the right of
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
Association and what that means is that
 
03:59:16.950 --> 03:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
the state cannot tell the parties who
 
03:59:19.710 --> 03:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
can and cannot vote in their primaries
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
so if a party wants to allow independent
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
voters to vote in their primaries the
 
03:59:26.670 --> 03:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
state can't tell them that that those
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
independent voters cannot vote in their
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
primaries so you need to allow the
 
03:59:32.429 --> 03:59:32.439 align:start position:0%
parties to make that decision rather
 
03:59:34.229 --> 03:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
than the state imposing that decision
 
03:59:37.349 --> 03:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
upon the parties I think that is just
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
about all other than that I have
 
03:59:41.070 --> 03:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
conducted a lot of surveys for of
 
03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
independent voters here in New Hampshire
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
that are part of Nationwide surve
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
surveys and independent voters people
 
03:59:51.030 --> 03:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
who are Undeclared voters for most of
 
03:59:53.830 --> 03:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
them the large large majority it's it's
 
03:59:56.590 --> 03:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
a decision that they make consciously
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's not just because they didn't bother
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
to register with the party they really
 
04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
do not want to belong to a party for
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
reasons have been mentioned already for
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
example they vote for the person not the
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
party also they might vote for issues in
 
04:00:13.830 --> 04:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
a very nuanced way and so they determine
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
it based on a very careful examination
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
of what the candidates stand for what
 
04:00:20.149 --> 04:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
they're saying what's going on in in
 
04:00:22.229 --> 04:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
their area at that time and they do not
 
04:00:23.790 --> 04:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
vote based on party and they don't want
 
04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
to be told that they have to join a
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
party to participate in a consequential
 
04:00:30.630 --> 04:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
election which is publicly funded by the
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:36.990 --> 04:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
much okay takeing no questions so next
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%

Franklin and I oppose House Bill 1 um 72
 
04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm a bit going to be a bit of a data
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
nerd here instead of telling you a story
 
04:01:18.110 --> 04:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
but the Undeclared party uh as of the
 
04:01:24.670 --> 04:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
324,000 Undeclared voters that's bigger
 
04:01:30.269 --> 04:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
than the Republican party or the
 
04:01:32.550 --> 04:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
Democratic party and names on check
 
04:01:36.510 --> 04:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
checklist largest party we have um over
 
04:01:38.830 --> 04:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
6,000 people registered to vote on the
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
same day as the September primary so the
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
people who are registering same day
 
04:01:46.990 --> 04:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
um will have to declare a party because
 
04:01:48.269 --> 04:01:48.279 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to register
 
04:01:50.349 --> 04:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
Undeclared but a lot of Voters who
 
04:01:52.710 --> 04:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
register on same day do register
 
04:01:55.030 --> 04:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
Undeclared I did cite in the September
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
primary that there is 41,000 voters that
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
were Undeclared that C Cast Democratic
 
04:02:03.990 --> 04:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
ballot and 36,000 Undeclared voters that
 
04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh voted Republican I have the breakdown
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
by County um but I think that almost
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
72,000 voters would not be able to vote
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
if this bill came law because they're
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters that voted in the
 
04:02:21.870 --> 04:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
state primary um I have a story from
 
04:02:26.349 --> 04:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
Linda who is a ballot clerk in antrum um
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
she believes that this would
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
disadvantage Undeclared voters but as a
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
ballot clerk about a third of the voters
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
that came in are Undeclared and picked a
 
04:02:37.990 --> 04:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
party on the same day um she believes
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
that many of them will not know that
 
04:02:42.030 --> 04:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
this new rule exists and they will yell
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
at the ballot Clerks um they will not
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
yell at you they will yell at the ballot
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
clerks um and it might uh disadvantage
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
people to volunteer as election workers
 
04:02:56.670 --> 04:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
as well um as we should be encouraging
 
04:02:56.680 --> 04:02:58.070 align:start position:0%
as well um as we should be encouraging
more

04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%

everybody that's gone before me I've
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
changed a little bit of what I've had to
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
say but um I support this bill I'm a
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
registered voter I'm a citizen of New
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I support this bill
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
because it attempts to fix 654 34 as one
 
04:03:45.710 --> 04:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the original six people who have been
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
in federal court for a year and a half
 
04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
trying to bring this forward for
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
everybody to understand um I appreciate
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
the five or six people that have come
 
04:03:57.070 --> 04:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
forward taking our hard work thousands
 
04:03:58.830 --> 04:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
of dollars and thousands of hours to
 
04:04:01.070 --> 04:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
move forward so I'm glad somebody is
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
paying attention to our hard work um
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
there is not an attorney in this state
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
that would take any of our cases so we
 
04:04:10.590 --> 04:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
did everything as prosay so nothing that
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
we do is intended to be negative or or
 
04:04:16.750 --> 04:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
um stop people from being allowed to
 
04:04:20.349 --> 04:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
vote that said um we don't want
 
04:04:23.070 --> 04:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
independence to be left out what we want
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
is the law to be followed which it says
 
04:04:28.670 --> 04:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
the first Wednesday in June you are to
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
declare your party independent is not an
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
official or an Undeclared is not an
 
04:04:35.790 --> 04:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
official party Republican and Democrat
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
is they're also private and it does say
 
04:04:39.279 --> 04:04:42.110 align:start position:0%
is they're also private and it does say
very

04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.189 --> 04:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
clearly sorry it does say very clearly
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
the um New Hampshire Secretary of State
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
which is in the test testimony has
 
04:04:52.510 --> 04:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
advised that he does not have any
 
04:04:53.830 --> 04:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
written permission from the New
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire GOP opening the primaries to
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
Undeclared and that's where it all
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
started so what we're looking for is
 
04:05:04.030 --> 04:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
that all voters be equal there not be a
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
second and third class of voter um
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
whether you're a minority or majority
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
does not entitle you to more
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights than anybody else
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%

04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I lived in New Hampshire for
 
04:06:01.149 --> 04:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
30 years and uh I was the um uh um
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
principal author of The litigation that
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
Lyn Briggs uh was referring to um the
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
litigation is was very simple and that
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
is is that when somebody goes into to
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
register to vote if you're Undeclared
 
04:06:16.030 --> 04:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
you can change your vote right there the
 
04:06:18.550 --> 04:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
same day to a Republican or Democrat and
 
04:06:20.429 --> 04:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
then after you vote you go up to another
 
04:06:22.269 --> 04:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
desk and you say I want to change back
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
to Undeclared and you can do that as a
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
republican I can't do that so the
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
Undeclared have an advantage over me as
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh as a Republican and they also have a
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
um a an advantage over Democrats so and
 
04:06:40.269 --> 04:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
they can switch they can rearrange how
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
the presidential vote is is um is trans
 
04:06:46.630 --> 04:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
it transpires uh one of the dilemmas
 
04:06:49.149 --> 04:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
here and I'll read here when we went
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
into court the the court specifically
 
04:06:54.030 --> 04:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
stated and I'm going to submit these as
 
04:06:56.149 --> 04:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
exhibits uh the court credits the
 
04:06:57.870 --> 04:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
testimony of the three plaintiffs in
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
this case as credible and
 
04:07:01.469 --> 04:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
straightforward their claims and
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
arguments were advanced in good faith
 
04:07:06.429 --> 04:07:06.439 align:start position:0%
the evidence and applicable law however
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
do not confer standing under these facts
 
04:07:11.790 --> 04:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
and circumstances the reason why the the
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
the federal court claimed we didn't have
 
04:07:17.670 --> 04:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
standing is because um we were claiming
 
04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
that we were disenfranchised so all of
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
the individuals that are against this
 
04:07:24.149 --> 04:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
bill that claimed they disenfranchised
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
federal court said disenfranchise
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't work didn't work for us it can't
 
04:07:32.910 --> 04:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
work for them um and um when you keep
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
going uh um and and I apologize I
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
learned about this about five hours ago
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
so I I tried to scribble as much as I
 
04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
could um in the suit it refers to
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 654 34 being in conflict with
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
65914 and and uh that's the issue that
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh my colleague um Mrs Briggs was had
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh I will mention one other
 
04:08:05.670 --> 04:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
thing and that is uh on page uh on page
 
04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
11 of the ruling and I'll get to that
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
right now and I I I may have stated that
 
04:08:13.750 --> 04:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
case already I'm going to have to bring
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
your remarks to a conclusion because
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
your time has expired um oh good I don't
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
have to talk anymore that's that's right
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
um but if you do have a I don't believe
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
I've seen this court case so if you have

hb1 172 for the record my name is
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
Kristen Evans and I the director of
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
policy for Abel New Hampshire AEL is a
 
04:12:24.030 --> 04:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
disability Justice organization that
 
04:12:25.950 --> 04:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
fights for the civil and human rights of
 
04:12:28.109 --> 04:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
children and adults with disabilities I
 
04:12:30.750 --> 04:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
am here today in strong opposition to HP
 
04:12:33.149 --> 04:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
172 this bill is another brick in
 
04:12:35.229 --> 04:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
thewall of voter suppression an
 
04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barrier that will
 
04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impact voters with
 
04:12:41.149 --> 04:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities in New Hampshire we pride
 
04:12:43.349 --> 04:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
ourselves on Civic engagement on fost
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
ing robust participation in our
 
04:12:46.670 --> 04:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
democracy but this bill does the
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
opposite it restricts access it silences
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
voices and it actively discourages
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
participation HB 172 is a solution in
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
search of a problem there is no evidence
 
04:12:59.710 --> 04:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
that the same day party registration has
 
04:13:01.870 --> 04:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
caused any systemic issues in our
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
elections what this bill does however is
 
04:13:06.269 --> 04:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
create new hurdles for voters who
 
04:13:09.550 --> 04:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
already face enough of them people with
 
04:13:11.550 --> 04:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities often cannot predict months
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
in advance which primary they will need
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
or want to participate in life
 
04:13:17.870 --> 04:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances change and limiting when
 
04:13:20.070 --> 04:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
and how voters can affiliate only
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
ensures that fewer people can engage in
 
04:13:24.990 --> 04:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
the Democratic process for people with
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities these barriers are even
 
04:13:29.149 --> 04:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
greater many disabled voters are ready
 
04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
navigate a voting system that is often
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
inaccessible lacks proper accommodations
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
or is riddled with bureaucratic hurdles
 
04:13:38.349 --> 04:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
that that make participating in
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
elections far more difficult than it
 
04:13:43.109 --> 04:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
should be New Hampshire New Hampshire's
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voter system gives people
 
04:13:47.149 --> 04:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility and that flexibility is
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
essential for full par participation in
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
democracy taking that away would harm
 
04:13:54.030 --> 04:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
voters with disabilities stripping them
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
of a process that helps ensure their
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
voices are heard hb1 172 strips away the
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility that has divined our state's
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
particip participatory democracy a
 
04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility that many voters especially
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
those with disabilities rely on and
 
04:14:10.990 --> 04:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
let's be clear the ability to register
 
04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
and vote in the primary of one's
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
choosing is not just about convenience
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's about Equity it's about ensuring
 
04:14:19.309 --> 04:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
that our democracy is accessible to all
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
voters HB 172 is a step in the wrong
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
direction it limits Choice it
 
04:14:26.550 --> 04:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
discourages participation and it ignores
 
04:14:29.950 --> 04:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
the reality of Voters lives thank you
 
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:31.640 align:start position:0%
would you be taking questions yes are
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
04:14:35.349 --> 04:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you um we had a late
 
04:14:45.630 --> 04:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
I wasn't planning to say anything but I
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
was so frustrated by hearing how we
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
should cut off 40% of the population
 
04:14:56.030 --> 04:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
because they hadn't already decided who
 
04:14:58.229 --> 04:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
they were going to vote for I have been
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
an Undeclared voter for probably as long
 
04:15:02.349 --> 04:15:02.359 align:start position:0%
as I've been in New Hampshire which is
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
40 some years and I have prided myself
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
on studying candidates in both parties
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
and sometimes there is a candidate for
 
04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
an office that's really outstand
 
04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
standing in one party and sometimes in a
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
different party and I feel that we
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to make that choice at
 
04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
the polling place and not have to sign
 
04:15:26.349 --> 04:15:26.359 align:start position:0%
up blindly six months in advance for one
 
04:15:29.910 --> 04:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.429 --> 04:15:32.439 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and committee we're

about campaign Finance uh instead of um
 
04:16:40.199 --> 04:16:41.429 align:start position:0%
about campaign Finance uh instead of um
voting

04:16:41.429 --> 04:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
voting
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
registration um this bill uh closes a
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
glaring loophole in our campaign Finance
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
laws uh one that does not even exists
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
under federal laws currently there's no
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
mention of limited liability companies
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire campaign Finance laws
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
and each I'm going to call them llc's um
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
instead of limited liability companies
 
04:17:08.469 --> 04:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
is treated as its own individual donor
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of direct campaign
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
contributions regardless of who controls
 
04:17:14.479 --> 04:17:15.469 align:start position:0%
contributions regardless of who controls
that

04:17:15.469 --> 04:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:19.229 --> 04:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
LLC so I can give the maximum
 
04:17:21.630 --> 04:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
contribution that I'm allowed to my
 
04:17:24.670 --> 04:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
favorite candidate and then assuming
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm much richer than I really am
 
04:17:30.630 --> 04:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
now um I can set up unlimited numbers of
 
04:17:34.349 --> 04:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
llc's and give as much as I wish through
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
those llc's to my candidate well in
 
04:17:41.149 --> 04:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
exess of the statutory cap for natural
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
persons or for corpor operations the
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill requires that a political
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
contribution by an LLC be allocated to
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
its members for purposes of determining
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
whether a member has exceeded
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
contribution limits in the New Hampshire
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
statutes the allocation is tied to their
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
percentage interest in the LLC and
 
04:18:06.990 --> 04:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
corporations um are included since they
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
can also be members of an LLC the bill
 
04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
makes LLC subject to the same political
 
04:18:16.590 --> 04:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
campaign contributions that we have for
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
individuals and
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
corporations so under this bill if an
 
04:18:24.510 --> 04:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
LLC donates to a candidate then it must
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
disclose the names and the percentage
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
ownership of each member to the
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
candidate which will then be attributed
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
to that member's contribution limits
 
04:18:36.590 --> 04:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law the bill
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
provides transparency to prevent wealthy
 
04:18:43.149 --> 04:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
individuals and corporations from having
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
undue influence in elections due to a
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
loophole in New Hampshire's campaign
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
Finance laws uh we're not the only state
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that has this problem but we are uh
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
the subject of much of it because our
 
04:19:01.590 --> 04:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance laws are deemed as um
 
04:19:05.790 --> 04:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
weak this bill does not stifle or impair
 
04:19:08.590 --> 04:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
small businesses or prevent them from
 
04:19:11.750 --> 04:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
participating in campaigns the llc's
 
04:19:14.189 --> 04:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
targeted by the Bill are not typical
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
small businesses so this isn't your mom
 
04:19:19.229 --> 04:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
and pop or an individual setting up to
 
04:19:20.950 --> 04:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
protect themselves from liabilities
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
these are companies that come in and
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
intentionally set up llc's so they can
 
04:19:27.309 --> 04:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
contribute to
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
campaigns they are used by both parties
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
to avoid contribution limits and prevent
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
transparency if the members of a
 
04:19:39.389 --> 04:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
traditional LLC wish to donate to a
 
04:19:41.950 --> 04:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
candidate and protect their identity as
 
04:19:41.960 --> 04:19:43.309 align:start position:0%
candidate and protect their identity as
members

04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:19:45.309 --> 04:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
they can make a distribution to that
 
04:19:47.910 --> 04:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
member and let the member donate to the
 
04:19:50.109 --> 04:19:50.119 align:start position:0%
candidate yes that might be another
 
04:19:52.870 --> 04:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
loophole but it works and it's more
 
04:19:55.149 --> 04:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
transparent contrary to what you may
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
have been told this bill does not
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
violate citizens united or its progeny
 
04:20:03.030 --> 04:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
that case permits New Hampshire to lend
 
04:20:04.950 --> 04:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
it spend to limit spending by
 
04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
corporations and business entities and
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
it also promotes transparency this bill
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
does not prevent Free Speech it simply
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
requires individuals and corporations to
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
abide by the contribution limits that we
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
set out in our laws so ultimately
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
closing this loophole is a question of
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
fairness and
 
04:20:29.070 --> 04:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
transparency most of us can agree that
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that is going into
 
04:20:34.830 --> 04:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
our uh top tier elections is
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
objectionable and it goes up every year
 
04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
this bill helps eradicate the effect of
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
laws or other loopholes that allow
 
04:20:45.550 --> 04:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
enterprising individuals enterprising
 
04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
wealthy individuals to evade the intent
 
04:20:50.950 --> 04:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
of state legislators and determining
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
Fair contribution limits above which an
 
04:20:55.950 --> 04:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
individual shall not go whether that
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
individual is a natural person or a
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
limited liability company under the law
 
04:21:04.349 --> 04:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
person can mean a corporation a limited
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
liabil ability company or a natural
 
04:21:09.630 --> 04:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
person so I ask for your support to
 
04:21:12.070 --> 04:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
improve our campaign Finance laws by
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
improving transparency and reducing the
 
04:21:18.189 --> 04:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
dark money that flows into New Hampshire
 
04:21:21.030 --> 04:21:21.040 align:start position:0%

last time yeah yeah you but you I think
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%

yeah good afternoon uh members of the
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
committee my favorite topic this LLC
 
04:22:04.670 --> 04:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
loophole um why we're in open democracy
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
is in support of house bill one
 
04:22:09.950 --> 04:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
41 um we need to reduce the influence of
 
04:22:11.950 --> 04:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
big money in our politics and increase
 
04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
the voices of everyday citizens this
 
04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
bill provides transparency and
 
04:22:19.870 --> 04:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
accountability um as you know there's
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
limits that anyone can give um and those
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
limits are
 
04:22:29.030 --> 04:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
$15,000 for any individual so if I if I
 
04:22:31.109 --> 04:22:31.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to give Connie Lane
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
$15,000 I could uh but if I have a
 
04:22:36.750 --> 04:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
second company I can give her
 
04:22:40.750 --> 04:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
$30,000 um but we also have another
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
loophole in our law called the the
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
political advocacy committee that can
 
04:22:47.109 --> 04:22:47.119 align:start position:0%
give unlimited donations so these
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
limited liability companies should just
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
be creating political or you know
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
political organizations and just funnel
 
04:22:55.830 --> 04:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
money through our our laws but uh or the
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
Swiss cheese of our laws I want to um
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
first talk about
 
04:23:05.149 --> 04:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
2010 um 2010 um gorial candidate John
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
Stevens caused a stir by raising over
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 from 30 limited liability
 
04:23:12.000 --> 04:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
$100,000 from 30 limited liability
corporations

04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and Connecticut so out
 
04:23:17.469 --> 04:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
of state money um that were Dunkin
 
04:23:17.479 --> 04:23:18.510 align:start position:0%
of state money um that were Dunkin
Donuts

04:23:18.510 --> 04:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
Donuts
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
franchised um August 18th uh this is my
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
daughter's birthday 13 llc's gave
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
governatori candidate Kevin Smith um the
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
maximum amount um half of Smith's
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
$324,000 of contributions came from
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
llc's at the same address in
 
04:23:39.680 --> 04:23:41.429 align:start position:0%
llc's at the same address in
Massachusetts

04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
um we've seen multiple Li liability
 
04:23:47.910 --> 04:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
companies use candidates on uh from from
 
04:23:50.149 --> 04:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
both from both sides of the aisle have
 
04:23:52.510 --> 04:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
used the LLC Loop loophole to funnel
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
money into their campaign I'm going to
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
go to
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
2020 uh 12 where Kevin landan uh wrote a
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
story about campaign contributions and
 
04:24:05.790 --> 04:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
these ones are fun decking the decking
 
04:24:08.349 --> 04:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
company get gave the max amount but then
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
decking 18
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
3209 l C and decking Atlantic
 
04:24:19.149 --> 04:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
1720 gave another amount of money and
 
04:24:21.790 --> 04:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
they all came from the same address so
 
04:24:24.189 --> 04:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
we know they're connected in some way
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
shape or
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
form that to bring your remarks to a
 
04:24:30.109 --> 04:24:30.119 align:start position:0%
conclusion okay uh well I I I go through
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
multiple different campaign Cycles but
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
so I'll just skip to the last 2024 uh we
 
04:24:38.149 --> 04:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
saw key Auto Group make a lot of LLC
 
04:24:41.149 --> 04:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
contributions over the limit um to a
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
candidate that took 20 1 million in
 
04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
political advocacy committee money
 
04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
dollars um this bill has been tried
 
04:24:51.269 --> 04:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
multiple times um without success but
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's important that you fix this
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
loophole before the next election but I
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
have said that multiple times
 
04:25:00.510 --> 04:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
before happy to take any
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the
 
04:25:06.750 --> 04:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um oh

04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
class
 
04:25:37.189 --> 04:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
so but we've already seen the uh
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
popularity of your of your classes today
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
haven't we Oh I thought it was funny all
 
04:25:45.910 --> 04:25:45.920 align:start position:0%

04:25:57.429 --> 04:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
um I live in Hanover where I work as a
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
teacher and uh and my and my number one
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
worry when I started my career Mr chair
 
04:26:05.229 --> 04:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
was that I would run out of things to
 
04:26:06.990 --> 04:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
say before the class
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
ended and uh I've been working on that
 
04:26:09.279 --> 04:26:10.950 align:start position:0%
ended and uh I've been working on that
ever

04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
ever
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
since so so um this bill House Bill
 
04:26:22.510 --> 04:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
175 would um prohibit independent groups
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
that spend money on campaigns and and
 
04:26:30.429 --> 04:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
candidates from coordinating their
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures it's an anti-coordination
 
04:26:37.149 --> 04:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
bill um there are different limits for
 
04:26:39.429 --> 04:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
how much independent groups can spend
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
and how much candidates can spend in
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
some cases there's no limits for for
 
04:26:45.309 --> 04:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
some independent groups so if candidates
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
can coordinate with independent groups
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
they can get around the limits they're
 
04:26:49.630 --> 04:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:26:52.349 --> 04:26:52.359 align:start position:0%
law and and they can spend an unlimited
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
amount and also in some cases they won't
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
have to reveal they they get around
 
04:26:59.389 --> 04:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
contribution limits and they also get
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
around disclosure limits so they don't
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
have to show who's giving them money how
 
04:27:05.309 --> 04:27:05.319 align:start position:0%
much money they're getting or what
 
04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
they're spending it
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
on as the law would ordinarily require
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
candidates to do so it's a it's it's a
 
04:27:14.469 --> 04:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
huge back door around all of the rules
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire campaign Finance law
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
that um that we apply to candidates now
 
04:27:21.840 --> 04:27:23.389 align:start position:0%
that um that we apply to candidates now
that

04:27:23.389 --> 04:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:26.590 --> 04:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
massive back door that massive ability
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
to just escape the burden of campaign
 
04:27:30.910 --> 04:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
Finance disclosure and contribution
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
rules is something that I think the
 
04:27:36.590 --> 04:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
party Elites want I think party Elites
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
and both parties want this party Elites
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
and both parties there's no innocence
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know in politics
 
04:27:46.109 --> 04:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
party Elites and both parties love money
 
04:27:48.910 --> 04:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
they want money in unlimited amounts and
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're really really crafty about
 
04:27:52.990 --> 04:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to get it this is not a
 
04:27:55.389 --> 04:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
bill that the party Elites are going to
 
04:27:56.670 --> 04:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
jump up and down about they're going to
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
say oh look at that naive teacher from
 
04:28:00.910 --> 04:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
Handover who thinks you know we can
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
limit we can we can actually do
 
04:28:04.030 --> 04:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
something about the problem of big money
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
in politics the only people who might
 
04:28:08.510 --> 04:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
want this bill are citizens who are
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
worried about big money in politics and
 
04:28:11.309 --> 04:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's one of the interesting things if
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
you look at polling you know it's just
 
04:28:15.510 --> 04:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
amazing to see how much Democrats and
 
04:28:17.590 --> 04:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
Republicans disagree you get 80% of
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
Republicans on this versus 10 you know 8
 
04:28:22.990 --> 04:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
n 90% opposing the Democrats one of the
 
04:28:24.750 --> 04:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
only thing you get big numbers on the
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
same side is about the the role of big
 
04:28:29.229 --> 04:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
money in politics you know get like 80%
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
of Republicans saying that's a problem
 
04:28:33.229 --> 04:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
get 85 90% of Democrats saying that's a
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
problem this spills an attempt to make a
 
04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
difference about with respect to to that
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
problem by making sure that independent
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures and that's a term that
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
shows up in New Hampshire rsas we' put
 
04:28:47.189 --> 04:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
that in the law independent
 
04:28:49.229 --> 04:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
expenditures make sure that independent
 
04:28:51.630 --> 04:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures are actually
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
independent and by the way you know look
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
let's look at some campaign Finance laws
 
04:28:58.510 --> 04:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
that you know that that let's say I
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
think I don't know maybe they're not
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
very partisan look at citizens united
 
04:29:06.910 --> 04:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
citizens united uses the term
 
04:29:10.590 --> 04:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures citizens united
 
04:29:13.389 --> 04:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
says that independent expenditures are
 
04:29:14.429 --> 04:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
those that are made without
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
pre-arrangement or coordination with
 
04:29:19.630 --> 04:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
candidates and it and it says that those
 
04:29:21.510 --> 04:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures shouldn't have to have
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
limits but that but that expenditures
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
that candidates make you know that's
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
totally reasonable for the law to limit
 
04:29:29.389 --> 04:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
what the you know to to regulate what
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
candidates make and so even the the just
 
04:29:34.750 --> 04:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
the terms of citizens united depend on
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
this idea of making independent
 
04:29:39.309 --> 04:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
expenditures independent if we have a
 
04:29:40.750 --> 04:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
massive lowle that makes these
 
04:29:42.030 --> 04:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures not indep
 
04:29:44.750 --> 04:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
dependent none of this makes any sense
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
and and and it's a huge deception on the
 
04:29:51.510 --> 04:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
public so so this bill is is an effort
 
04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
to you know to address that problem and
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
and and and solve that problem and uh Mr
 
04:30:01.550 --> 04:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
chair um I I I I would um take questions
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
04:30:05.349 --> 04:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
any are questions from the
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
committee oh representative
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
link uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
um isn't
 
04:30:15.790 --> 04:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that this was a
 
04:30:18.670 --> 04:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
new ruling the letter from the Attorney
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
General's office interpreting our
 
04:30:24.189 --> 04:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
statutes that for years we had what you
 
04:30:25.790 --> 04:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
talked about that there was an
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
anti-coordination and this term we had a
 
04:30:30.000 --> 04:30:31.349 align:start position:0%
anti-coordination and this term we had a
new

04:30:31.349 --> 04:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation um so are you attempting
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
to address that that came up in this
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
election I do think that it's an
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
increasing problem in New Hampshire
 
04:30:43.389 --> 04:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
campaigns and that the door right now is
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
open to
 
04:30:47.550 --> 04:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
coordination um and but you know look
 
04:30:49.710 --> 04:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
there are 20 states that have that have
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
done the same thing this is something
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
that if you if you if you have the term
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
independent expenditure in your laws as
 
04:30:56.349 --> 04:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does then you have a
 
04:30:58.030 --> 04:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
reason to make sure they're independent
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
and it's not just a response to one
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
letter by one attorney
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
general further questions from the
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you um next
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:22.349 --> 04:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
mcken on Deck is Olivia zinc I don't
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
have any other cards for
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
175 um so representative can you grab
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
that blue sheet for me um thank you
 
04:31:30.590 --> 04:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Barry and members of the
 
04:31:32.590 --> 04:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is kayy
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
of stadio I a Durham voter and public
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
policy fellow with open democracy and
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
today I am reading testimony in support
 
04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
of HB 175 on behalf of Aaron mcken who
 
04:31:47.229 --> 04:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
is senior legal counsel at um The
 
04:31:49.990 --> 04:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
Campaign Legal Center and since this is
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
seven pages I will spare you from the
 
04:31:54.269 --> 04:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
legal jargon and just read a little
 
04:31:56.670 --> 04:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
summary of it and hope that you will all
 
04:32:00.429 --> 04:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
peruse this on your own time so uh Aaron
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
says that campaign Legal Center
 
04:32:05.229 --> 04:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
carefully reviewed HB 175 and found that
 
04:32:06.910 --> 04:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
it is well crafted in in a
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional piece of legislation as
 
04:32:12.189 --> 04:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
explained further in the seven pages HB
 
04:32:14.469 --> 04:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
175 would close critical gaps in New
 
04:32:16.229 --> 04:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's law that allow political
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
advoc advocacy organizations to raise
 
04:32:21.109 --> 04:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
unlimited contributions and funnel those
 
04:32:23.229 --> 04:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
directly to candidates closing these
 
04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
gaps prevents circumvention of
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
contribution limits to candidates
 
04:32:28.950 --> 04:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
ensuring such limits curb quote the
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
actuality and appearance of corruption
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
resulting from large individual Finance
 
04:32:37.109 --> 04:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
contributions importantly HB 175 also
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
strengthens New Hampshire's coordination
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
law to comprehensively account for the
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
ways in which candidates and outside
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
groups coordinate their spending the
 
04:32:46.710 --> 04:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
bill would clarify and expand the types
 
04:32:49.149 --> 04:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
of conduct that constitute coordination
 
04:32:50.670 --> 04:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
and the kinds of election spending
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
subject to coordination rules thereby
 
04:32:54.349 --> 04:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
preventing outside groups from
 
04:32:57.070 --> 04:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
circumventing contribution limits as the
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court has recognized
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
regulating coordinated expenditures
 
04:33:02.510 --> 04:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
advances the same anti-corruption
 
04:33:05.189 --> 04:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
interests as limits on contributions and
 
04:33:07.150 --> 04:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
quote prevents attempts to circumvent
 
04:33:08.670 --> 04:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
the limits through pre-arranged or
 
04:33:10.709 --> 04:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
coordinated expenditures accounting to
 
04:33:12.670 --> 04:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
disguise contribution
 
04:33:15.310 --> 04:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support this bill will we
 
04:33:16.830 --> 04:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
be taking questions from the committee
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
sure if I can answer any are there
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
04:33:23.629 --> 04:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
thank you next up and last up is Olivia
 
04:33:31.390 --> 04:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.709 --> 04:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
you okay I think this is a lot of times
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
you've heard from me today so Olivia
 
04:33:37.949 --> 04:33:37.959 align:start position:0%
zinc a voter in Franklin executive
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
director of open democracy and I'm here
 
04:33:43.230 --> 04:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
to testify in favor of House Bill
 
04:33:46.269 --> 04:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
175 our democracy to be effective for
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
our democracy to be effective candidates
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
and elected officials need to answer to
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
their constituents not wealthy special
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
interests campaign contribution limits
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
play an important role in protecting
 
04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
this to reduce the undue influence of
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
wealthy donors and politics there must
 
04:34:06.510 --> 04:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
be guard rails against political
 
04:34:09.869 --> 04:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
corruption um and and um you know we
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
talk about coordination candidates can
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
put things on their website and special
 
04:34:17.310 --> 04:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
interest in pack groups can take them so
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
what we call that red boxing in the
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance world so on page two um
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the ab c d talks about that
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
red boxing so if you put something in a
 
04:34:30.910 --> 04:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
red in a on your own website and says
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
for four voters to know and then the
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
political committees take the four
 
04:34:37.629 --> 04:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
voters to know information and put it in
 
04:34:41.830 --> 04:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
an ad right so that is what uh this is
 
04:34:45.230 --> 04:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
trying to do is that sort of red boxing
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
um that happens um with coordinated
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
spending this also is uh
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
valuable for candidates uh to evade
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
campaign limits direct contributions and
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
coordinate with outside Spenders
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
remember outside Spenders in New
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are mostly out of state
 
04:35:06.429 --> 04:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
Spenders they're they're big money
 
04:35:09.070 --> 04:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
coming in from out of state it's not
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
local money that's being spent to
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
influence our Liv ction s um house bill
 
04:35:19.390 --> 04:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
um 472 creates and expands upon a
 
04:35:21.551 --> 04:35:21.561 align:start position:0%
definition def the definition of
 
04:35:24.510 --> 04:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
coordinated and independent expenditure
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
clearly outlining the difference between

Tillman act which stands to this day it

04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%

political committee or for any political
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%

04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
directors should not be permitted to use
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
stockholders money and remember that
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
stockholders money because we'll later
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
call that treasury or general funds for
 
04:44:34.830 --> 04:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
such purposes and moreover a Prohibition
 
04:44:37.230 --> 04:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
of this kind would be as far as it went
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
an effective method of stopping the
 
04:44:43.948 --> 04:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
evils aimed at in Corrupt Practices
 
04:44:46.590 --> 04:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
acts wildly
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
popular right after the Tillman Act was
 
04:44:51.788 --> 04:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
signed many many States including New
 
04:44:53.628 --> 04:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire signed their own state level
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on corporate donations
 
04:44:56.480 --> 04:44:57.750 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on corporate donations
political

04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
political
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
donations then after that as we get
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
later into the 20th century and unions
 
04:45:07.390 --> 04:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
become more of a thing uh we also put a
 
04:45:10.070 --> 04:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
type of ban on Union donations but when
 
04:45:12.310 --> 04:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
we did the Union donations it did not
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
look like the existing corporate
 
04:45:18.350 --> 04:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
donation ban the union donation ban was
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
very specific because it made two
 
04:45:23.230 --> 04:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
different source of funds distinct the
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
treasury which is the general funds in
 
04:45:29.230 --> 04:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
this case from member dues union dues
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
was prohibited you cannot make political
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
contributions a union cannot from their
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
dues from their General funds from their
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
treasury but what it said is that you
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
can in fact create a segregated fund
 
04:45:47.550 --> 04:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
that is funded through voluntary
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
donations to then be given for political
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
contributions and that was legal so we
 
04:45:56.910 --> 04:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
created this kind of distinct system for
 
04:45:59.430 --> 04:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
unions okay so we have a complete ban on
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
corporations and a kind of half ban on
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
unions and then in 1999 Kennedy V
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
Gardner New Hampshire Supreme Court case
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court struck down
 
04:46:14.750 --> 04:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
the corporate ban as being overly
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
broad they didn't say that it would um
 
04:46:18.480 --> 04:46:19.990 align:start position:0%
broad they didn't say that it would um
be

04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:46:22.350 --> 04:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional if it had been worded
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
like the union ban and I'm looking for
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
the quote from that right now um but
 
04:46:30.548 --> 04:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
it's it said there is of course a simple
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
solution to this simple problem the
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
general court can easily and effectively
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
amend the statute to reflect its actual
 
04:46:40.110 --> 04:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional intent meaning that if we
 
04:46:42.510 --> 04:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
simply re write the corporate ban
 
04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
instead of a complete General ban
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
rewrite it like the union ban then it
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
would be constitutional they gave us
 
04:46:51.510 --> 04:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
that directive in
 
04:46:54.510 --> 04:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
1999 what we then did is we struck out
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
the corporate ban in its entirety did
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
not replace it so now for the last 26
 
04:47:05.070 --> 04:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
years we've had a partial ban on Union
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
donations from Union treasury funds but
 
04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
a uh complete free-for-all on corporate
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
donations we have no ban whatsoever on
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
corporate donations in the state so HB
 
04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
311 does exactly what the Supreme Court
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
said in the Kennedy V Garder case in
 
04:47:25.948 --> 04:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
1999 um a previous version of this bill
 
04:47:29.110 --> 04:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
I simply took the language on the unions
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
and duplicated it substituting in a
 
04:47:35.590 --> 04:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
different paragraph businesses and then
 
04:47:37.948 --> 04:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
a member who is no longer uh in the
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
house and was on Election L at the time
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
wrote a Minority Report stating that I
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
was somehow trying to treat unions and
 
04:47:45.708 --> 04:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
corporations differently when in fact
 
04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the opposite so what I
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
have done here is instead of duplicating
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
a paragraph I shoved businesses into the
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph that unions are currently in
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
so that you can see very clearly that
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
the same exact language and the same
 
04:48:01.948 --> 04:48:01.958 align:start position:0%
exact paragraph applies equally to
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
businesses and unions which is a ban on
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
General treasury funds being used for
 
04:48:11.070 --> 04:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
corporate donations so that stockholder
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
shareholder stakeholder funds you can't
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
spend those funds because those were not
 
04:48:18.510 --> 04:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
given to you for political purposes but
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
you can create a segregated fund what we
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
today call a pack to spend uh political
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures out
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
of and I'll just close by saying that um
 
04:48:34.910 --> 04:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
Banning the corporate fiddling in our
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
elections is one of the most broadly
 
04:48:42.070 --> 04:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
popular maybe not amongst politicians
 
04:48:44.270 --> 04:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
but amongst the people regardless of
 
04:48:47.470 --> 04:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
political stripe everyone hates the idea
 
04:48:48.830 --> 04:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
that our elections are bought and paid
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
for everybody just talk to regular Rank
 
04:48:54.708 --> 04:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
and file whoever and I'll close with
 
04:48:56.510 --> 04:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
that happy to answer
 
04:48:59.070 --> 04:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
questions okay questions from the
 
04:49:01.390 --> 04:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you I only
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%

04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
session after um Missy times expires um
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Olivia zinc
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
executive director at open democracy and
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of House Bill 311 um
 
04:49:27.070 --> 04:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
I want to just say that this prohibits
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
business organizations from making
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
political contribution in the wake of
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
Garder or Kennedy versus Garder which
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
was a 1999 decision so it's 25 years old
 
04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
um I know the prime sponsor just said it
 
04:49:41.910 --> 04:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
was a Supreme Court but I have that it's
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
a US District Court um that struck um
 
04:49:50.190 --> 04:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
down a ban on the business organization
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
this ban was repealed from New Hampshire
 
04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
law in 2011 so even though the court
 
04:49:59.390 --> 04:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
Struck it down in 1999 the election law
 
04:50:02.310 --> 04:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh repealed it uh in
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
2011 um despite this
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
case um it it really
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
said it this the judge gave us the facts
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
in this case and they said uh in the
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
word words exploited by the legislature
 
04:50:22.750 --> 04:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
are clear and um
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
unambiguous and the evidence to the
 
04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
intent to Pro preclude corporations from
 
04:50:31.788 --> 04:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
making political contribution unless
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
those sources so they just want you to
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
make segregated funds and make sure that
 
04:50:38.510 --> 04:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
the sources are disclosed it's very
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
simple the court told you how to fix it
 
04:50:45.070 --> 04:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
and to to to make it the Constitutional
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
intent um you know it does exactly what
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
union we have for unions so um it just
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
brings Equity into the different
 
04:50:58.030 --> 04:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
entities so that corporations don't get
 
04:51:02.110 --> 04:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
more influence in our elections and um
 
04:51:04.628 --> 04:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
make them contribute through segregated
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
funds or volunteer contributions
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
currently there's a law that utility
 
04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
companies can't give money to political
 
04:51:14.110 --> 04:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
candidates and have them used for their
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
rate payers but because they're not
 
04:51:17.830 --> 04:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
going through a segregated fund we don't
 
04:51:21.628 --> 04:51:21.638 align:start position:0%
know if the if those utility donations
 
04:51:27.390 --> 04:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
are um are are fungible or if they're uh
 
04:51:29.150 --> 04:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
you know I I think many people do not
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
want eversource's political
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
contributions to be part of the rates
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
that they pay to the electricity company
 
04:51:39.910 --> 04:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
um or any other public utility um so
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
please uh this does have a straight line
 
04:51:46.830 --> 04:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
um from The Gardener decision um to make
 
04:51:48.390 --> 04:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
sure that we have a level play playing
 
04:51:52.030 --> 04:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
field for corporate spending um so ple I
 
04:51:53.788 --> 04:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
urge you to do the right thing and
 
04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
support this bill and with that I'm
 
04:51:57.310 --> 04:51:57.320 align:start position:0%

from the committee representative Lane
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
um could you speak to whether or not
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
this would violate citizens united no
 
04:52:07.150 --> 04:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
this would not violate citizens united
 
04:52:08.510 --> 04:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
because corporations can still make
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
political contributions they just have
 
04:52:11.590 --> 04:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
to do it through through a segregated
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%

voters um
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
for um that process uh they have to fill
 
04:53:58.628 --> 04:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
out the federal official postcard no
 
04:54:00.830 --> 04:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
earlier than January of a calendar year

minute uh before we do the next hearing
 
05:01:05.868 --> 05:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
so a couple of housekeeping things um I
 
05:01:08.270 --> 05:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
will send out the link but I showed the
 
05:01:10.590 --> 05:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
ranking member and the vice chairman
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
um a form that I have made using the
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
license we get from Microsoft Office um
 
05:01:20.150 --> 05:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
with via the state um so I'll send it
 
05:01:22.830 --> 05:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
out in a BCC U but that is how I want
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
you to send in committee reports going
 
05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
forward because we have so many um it's
 
05:01:28.990 --> 05:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
going to have it has a drop- down menu
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
on it you can select who you are it has
 
05:01:32.990 --> 05:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
a drop- down menu for uh the bill number
 
05:01:35.230 --> 05:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
and the name um and then it has the
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
motion you're making um and it basically
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
requests all the information that you
 
05:01:40.708 --> 05:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
would give to me in email but instead of
 
05:01:41.628 --> 05:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
having a thousand different emails
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
bouncing around I'll have it in one nice
 
05:01:45.910 --> 05:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
spot when you click submit on that it
 
05:01:47.708 --> 05:01:47.718 align:start position:0%
goes to three people so be conscient
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
that when you click submit it's going to
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
three people it's going to myself the
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
ranking member and the vice chairman um
 
05:01:55.708 --> 05:01:55.718 align:start position:0%
if you have if you submit something and
 
05:01:57.788 --> 05:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
you need be changes obviously feel free
 
05:01:59.190 --> 05:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
to reach out to me and we will make
 
05:02:00.628 --> 05:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
those make that Arrangement but this
 
05:02:04.350 --> 05:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
will help me to put everything kind of
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
in one bucket um so I'm not digging
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
through umen emails trying to because
 
05:02:09.470 --> 05:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
some people are emailing me on my
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
campaign email address the people are
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's all over the place um so I would
 
05:02:16.110 --> 05:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
work with your respective party leader
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
in how that will work inside your
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
process um like I know for my friends on
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
the Democrats you guys usually send it
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
to representative Lane and she does
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
whatever she does with it and then she
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
sends it to me um however you guys work
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
that into your process that's fine um I
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't care but I want to receive it
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
through that link um and I'll make the
 
05:02:36.270 --> 05:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
the email title very obvious but that
 
05:02:37.708 --> 05:02:37.718 align:start position:0%
will help um and if anybody sees
 
05:02:38.948 --> 05:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
anything that should be added to that
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
form I'm happy to add it um but once
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
again when you click submit it's it's
 
05:02:46.350 --> 05:02:46.360 align:start position:0%

05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%

chair uh HB 464 in this amendment uh is
 
05:13:01.470 --> 05:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
intended to remove any potential image
 
05:13:04.110 --> 05:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
of a conflict of interest and is about
 
05:13:04.120 --> 05:13:05.390 align:start position:0%
of a conflict of interest and is about
public

05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
transparency uh so we can prevent any
 
05:13:09.948 --> 05:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
illusion of interference
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment uh it specifies
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what elected positions would be
 
05:13:17.548 --> 05:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to handle these ballots uh
 
05:13:18.990 --> 05:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
because obviously there are some that
 
05:13:21.548 --> 05:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
are statutorily and constitutionally
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
allowed uh and supposed to do these jobs
 
05:13:27.070 --> 05:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
