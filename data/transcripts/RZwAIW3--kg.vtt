00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
with the majority report the
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
pass representative brian sullivan from
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
to speak against the committee report
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
 
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.669 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
um

00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
1088 an act relative to employee
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
protections from covet 19 in the
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
workplace its title is pretty
 
00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
workplace its title is pretty
self-explanatory

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's the flip side to the many anti-vax
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
spills which have been introduced and
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
it says basically you just have the
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
right to be vaccinated against covet 19
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
and the right to use personal protective
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
equipment such as face masks and face
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
shields while employed in the workplace
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
and no employer shall discriminate in
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
any way against an employee based on the
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
employee exercising his or her rights
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
in this section and
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
so it is narrowly limited to covet 19
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the two of these some well three one
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
of the assumptions behind her is that
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
the vaccines the mass are worthwhile
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
they may not be 100 safe but they're
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
extremely safe certainly much safer than
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
the disease
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
same goes for the mass and ppe so
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
employees should be able to wear them in
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
the workplace to protect themselves
 
00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.549 align:start position:0%
the workplace to protect themselves
and

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
all workers have the right to protect
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
themselves it's killed nearly a million
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
americans 966 000 last time i checked
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
which is a couple of days ago and i
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't sp and um so
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of famous cases
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
about it but there have been some in
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and certainly um
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
there were a number of employers who
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
made the business decision to shut down
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
who specifically cited the first the
 
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.950 align:start position:0%
who specifically cited the first the
uh

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
ppe he's
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
the mass mandates during the state of
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
emergency as a reason why they shut down
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
even though that's a business this
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
season they had many factors in it so
 
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.430 align:start position:0%
season they had many factors in it so
[Music]

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
so please uh
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
please protect the right of our workers
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
they have the right to protect
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
themselves and they certainly
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
no one has the right to spread a
 
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
communicable disease especially one as
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
terrible as covet 19 because even if you
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
survive there's the long-term
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
consequences are in some cases
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
quite quite horrific and life-altering
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
so please and also i believe your
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
employer does not have the right to tell
 
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
employer does not have the right to tell
you

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
not to protect yourself against a
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease so please
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
please overturn the committee report and
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
vote for series
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
so an alternative motion
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
can be introduced thanks
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative time to
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
speak for the committee report
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
the labor committee only had one
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
individual speak in favor of this bill
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
and no one
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
against we have no evidence that there
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
is any discrimination or has been any
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination that has gone on for
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
someone unwilling or because someone
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
wants to wear a mask or a shield
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated or not vaccinated
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
you've all seen me wearing my mask
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
around here it's because i have an 84
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
year old mom i like to go see and it
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
makes her happy
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
that i have a mask when i'm in public
 
00:29:19.919 --> 00:29:21.510 align:start position:0%
that i have a mask when i'm in public
settings

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
settings
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
that's my choice
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
no one's criticized me
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
and i have not heard anyone
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
from any walk of life any email any
 
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
from any walk of life any email any

anything
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
that shows that individuals have
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
discriminated because of this
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
solution for a problem that doesn't
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%

00:29:58.559 --> 00:29:59.909 align:start position:0%
house bill 1088 are you ready for the
question

00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
eyes the eyes have it and the committee
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.510 align:start position:0%
we have
78

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
78
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
78 i think bill's left on the regular
 
00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:27.430 align:start position:0%
78 i think bill's left on the regular
calendar

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have any real
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
contentious debates as we had yesterday
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
quite a few have one-on-one and quite a
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
few don't have the base at all
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
so i uh we should be able to get through
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
without too much trouble today so i just
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to let everybody know
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
that today's calendar isn't anything
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%

put in place and tested
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that any family medical
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
leave is better than no family medical
 
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.950 align:start position:0%

leave

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button to
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
table this premature repeal
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
if i know there are private insurance
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
companies that are wanting to offer this
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
type of fmli insurance to private
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%

for any bureaucratic involvement
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
and if i also realize we have a short
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
window of opportunity
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
to remove the granite state fmli plant
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
from our rsas while still in its infancy
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
and prior to it being fully implemented
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
later this year or early next year
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know by
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
failing to remove from our books
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
legislation that was wrongly slipped
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
into hb2
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
we will forever
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
after be stuck with yet another
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i am in the
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
unenviable position
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
of coming before the house today to ask
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
you not to repeal a program that i could
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
not possibly be convinced to vote for
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
i am not going to stand here and pretend
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
like that i think the fmli plan that was
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
passed as part of hb2 in 2021 was a good
 
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.349 align:start position:0%
passed as part of hb2 in 2021 was a good
plan

00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
in fact i think it was extremely
 
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.829 align:start position:0%
in fact i think it was extremely
regressive

00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
regressive
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
were i to draft a paid family medical
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
leave plan it wouldn't look like this
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
for starters it's not universal a
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
private sector employee can only receive
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
the plan's benefits
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
if their employer happens to sign up for
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
there's no path for an individual to get
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
the coverage as part of a larger state
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
pool without the employer signing up
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
and those benefits
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of your regular income
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
forbes magazine reported in 2021 that
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
six in ten americans live paycheck to
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
paycheck and now it's closer to seven
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
and ten
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
so if you're an administrative assistant
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
making fifty five thousand dollars a
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
year sure you can probably forgo forty
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
percent of your income and still be okay
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
however if you're a state liquor store
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
employee who for reasons that escape me
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
only makes twelve dollars an hour
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
that person is expected under the fmli
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
plan at hb2 to live on seven dollars an
 
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.310 align:start position:0%
plan at hb2 to live on seven dollars an
hour

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
hour
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
if they take advantage of a plan that
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
both people in this hypothetical pay
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
taxes into
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
this is an upward redistribution of
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
wealth from the working class to the
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
permanent managerial class and doesn't
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
benefit those who need the program the
 
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.150 align:start position:0%
benefit those who need the program the
most

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.670 align:start position:0%
most
however

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
these are not the reasons why a repeal
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
is being discussed i wish it was
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
in committee reasons for repeal of this
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
plan were it costs money it may balloon
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
as more people sign up for it
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
well yes there is no free paid family
 
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.270 align:start position:0%
well yes there is no free paid family
leave

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
if you want a program you outline it if
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
it has the kind of popular support that
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
a real and robust paid family leave
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
program has shown to have in polls in
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you pass it and pay for it
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
this to me feels like the affordable
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
care act discussion in 2017.
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
i felt that the plan passed in 2009 was
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
alienating confusing technocratic
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company giveaways without even
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
a public option let alone universal
 
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.069 align:start position:0%
a public option let alone universal
coverage

00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
but the answer then wasn't repeal and
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's not the answer now
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
it was improved the minority wants this
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill to go to interim study so paid
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
family leave can be improved and made
 
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.790 align:start position:0%
family leave can be improved and made
better

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
we should fix this instead of throwing
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
away a bad plan and starting again at
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
square one thank you mr speaker
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
as previously stated at 1165 would
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
repeal the granite state
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
paid family medical leave insurance plan
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
part of hb2 last year
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's been tout as a way for the
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
private businesses to get paid family
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
leave insurance for their employees but
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
in fact in the end this is only going to
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
morph into a taxpayer-funded
 
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.069 align:start position:0%
morph into a taxpayer-funded
entitlement

00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
entitlement
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
so let's talk a little bit of the
 
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.589 align:start position:0%
so let's talk a little bit of the
specifics

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
under the current
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
plan the nearly eleven thousand state
 
00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:37.030 align:start position:0%
plan the nearly eleven thousand state
employees

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
would have their premiums for this
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
insurance plan
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
how much is that nobody knows the
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
answers because we passed this in hb2
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
without knowing how much it was going to
 
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.309 align:start position:0%
without knowing how much it was going to
cost

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
doing my own calculations and
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
you you can
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
you can bet this is going to be in the
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars every
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
year just for the 11 000 state employees
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
again on the backs of the taxpayers
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
this past january 1.9 million dollars
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
was authorized 1.9 million dollars just
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
to pay the consultants to look into
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
getting quotes and getting the plan up
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
our last executive session the insurance
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner asked to address our
 
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.030 align:start position:0%
commissioner asked to address our
committee

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
now this was just a week and a half ago
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
they've had
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
two bills
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
to repeal this
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
fmli plan in two different committees
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
nobody from the commissioner's office
 
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.550 align:start position:0%
nobody from the commissioner's office
attended

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
attended
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
so i asked we asked him at the executive
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
session the other day why are you coming
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
here now
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
why didn't anybody show up to these
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
original hearings if this was so
 
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.030 align:start position:0%
original hearings if this was so
important

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
and he had no answer
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
asked him about a few other things
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
in the current plan fifty percent of the
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
premiums that a business would pay
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
they would get a tax break on it
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
so i asked him
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
what's the net effect on the revenues
 
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
the commission also made the statement
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
during that hearing
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
that private businesses were very
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
interested in participating in this plan
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
when i asked him how many and what
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
businesses had indicated interest
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
he said he didn't have a number but he
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
thought he recalled some someone talking
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
now there are several other points in
 
00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.589 align:start position:0%
now there are several other points in
the

00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the uh purpose and policy statement
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
contained in the original language
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's in hb2 i'm going to mention one
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
of them because it's kind of interesting
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me it says
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
one of the primary reasons for this is
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining workers
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
this is pure nonsense
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
all we had to do is look at some of the
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
states that already have fmli
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
new york new jersey california illinois
 
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.470 align:start position:0%
new york new jersey california illinois
connecticut

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
note anything in common with those
 
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.309 align:start position:0%
note anything in common with those
states

00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
these are the most heavily taxed states
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
where the residents are fleeing they
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
have the highest net negative migration
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
of all estates in our country
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
no one is flocking to these states
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
now the reason why private and private
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
employers are not going to buy this
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
anyway is extremely expensive
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
during our last term or the last term i
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
was here senator felt has tried putting
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
through a plan
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
and during that testimony i won't go
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
through the whole thing
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
but there was an individual on our
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
committee who was a fireman
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
and he bought his own similar
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
type of insurance short-term disability
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
that had less coverage than this fmli
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
insurance plan had
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
and he had sixty dollars a week uh sixty
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
dollars a paycheck every other week
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
taken out of his plan so that's a
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
hundred twenty dollars per employee
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
without getting in boring you with a
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
private businesses are not going to be
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
signing up for this scheme
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to be back to the
 
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.150 align:start position:0%
we're going to be back to the
taxpayer-funded

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
state employees getting the benefit on
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
i mentioned before
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
insurance companies now one has already
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
filed and more will follow
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
to start providing similar fmli
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
insurance to private businesses in new
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.990 align:start position:0%
insurance to private businesses in new
hampshire

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
outside of the granite state
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
plan that's in our books
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
i have a copy of the document from the
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
the most important part and i mentioned
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
it briefly in my reason against tabling
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
is we have an opportunity now a short
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
window before the this thing gets fully
 
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.950 align:start position:0%
window before the this thing gets fully
implemented

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%

there are
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
the more disease we will have

00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
since this bill also applies to colleges
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
and universities
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
schools will be less able to protect

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
one disease that they are very
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
active about protecting is encephalitis
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
students who don't want to get into
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
encephalitis vaccination won't
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
that puts all students at risk
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
operate in close quarters
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
students live in dormitories
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
they go to class together
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
in groups
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
infectious disease can spread
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
quickly on college campuses
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
for that reason colleges often have
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
again not just against covid against
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
i got a call this morning from the
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
they ran the numbers
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
and have concluded
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
that just for the hospitals
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
the amount of medicaid and medicare
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
funding that we are at risk of losing
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
is in the vicinity of 2
 
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.549 align:start position:0%
is in the vicinity of 2
billion

00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
billion
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
with a b
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
our hospitals operate at a very
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
slim margin
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals have already closed because of
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
economic situations
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
we will lose hospitals if we lose our
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
it is at risk because
 
00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.150 align:start position:0%
it is at risk because
the

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
the center for
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid services
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
allow for exemptions
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
for medical and religious reasons
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
they do not allow for exemptions
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
if we add that exemption
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
and people
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
act on that exemption
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
we put all of that medicare and medicaid
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
funding at risk
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
this bill also does not allow for
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
those institutions to evaluate
 
00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.630 align:start position:0%
those institutions to evaluate
exemptions

00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
that is part of the
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
expectation from the cms
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
if we don't follow cms regulations
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
we might hear arguments that other
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
states have done exactly the same thing
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
as this bill intends to do
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
we'll hear that those states have not
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
yet there's a process
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
when that process takes place it'll be
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
evaluated whether or not our
 
00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
evaluated whether or not our
institutions

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
are following the the guidelines
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
if they are found to be in violation of
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
the guidelines
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
they will be warned
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is way too risky for us to
 
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:56.150 align:start position:0%
this is way too risky for us to
undertake

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
i also need to point out that our county
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes that all of us
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
are responsible for taking care of
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
we are all delegates
 
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
those county nursing homes cannot
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
operate without medicare and medicaid
 
00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:19.829 align:start position:0%
operate without medicare and medicaid
funding

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes they lose that
 
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.789 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes they lose that
funding

00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be county taxes
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
so essentially if we lose the funding
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
for medicare and medicaid
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
we're voting for a gigantic
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
increase in county taxes
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
hb 1210
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
is a dangerous bill we should not
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
please vote red
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
on the ought to pass
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're down to our last speaker
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
senate blazik has requested a roll call
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
as that's officially seconded
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote members take your seats
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.069 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
infantine

00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
infantine
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
you heard a lot of
 
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.789 align:start position:0%
you heard a lot of
really

00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
tough and dangerous talk just now
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
while i respect my colleague
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
on the labor committee i vehemently
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
disagree i think we're looking at two
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
vastly different bills
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
the labor committee had about i'd say 10
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
or 11 bills that came for us that had to
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
do with
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
covert related
 
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.589 align:start position:0%
covert related
issues

00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
and one of the things the labor
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
committee tries to do at all costs is
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
not to get in between business
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
and the legislature we try to tell them
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
what to do except for things of safety
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
so we have a situation where people have
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
the ability
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
a waiver if they had a medical reason or
 
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.829 align:start position:0%
a waiver if they had a medical reason or
religious

01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
reason what happens if you didn't have a
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
medical reason and you're not overly
 
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.430 align:start position:0%
medical reason and you're not overly
religious

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
what happens if you were
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
put on the spot explain to me exactly
 
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.510 align:start position:0%
put on the spot explain to me exactly
why

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.549 align:start position:0%
why
medically

01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
medically
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
you are unable to do this explain to me
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
exactly why
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
you have a problem uh you cannot take
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
this because of a religious reason
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
so the concept came up
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
right of conscience so what is right of
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
it means something within you says i do
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
not want to do this for my personal
 
01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:57.349 align:start position:0%
not want to do this for my personal
reasons

01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
that has never been offered
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
the goal of all the pieces of
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that we had we brought them
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
down to one
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
had a study committee and came up with
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
what you see now
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
trying to provide individuals the
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
ability to have that
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
the bill was
 
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.510 align:start position:0%
the bill was
very

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
well crafted
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
and has nothing to do with what mike you
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
heard just previously do you really
 
01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.230 align:start position:0%
heard just previously do you really
think

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
that after 14 years here as a chairman
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee i am going to put my
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
name on a piece of legislation that
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
takes two billion dollars away from new
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire and closes every single
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
nursing home i wouldn't do that i'm not
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
there are contracts
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
between the federal government
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
and providers of medicare and medicaid
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
we do not want to get involved in
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
between that contract
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
those contracts do say
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are required for certain
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
things or you're not going to get the
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
money no doubt
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get in between that
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
what this allows
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
is someone to be able to say hey i have
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
a right of conscience here i'm going to
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
sign a piece of paper and say i've
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
written a conscience
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
it has to be accepted by the employer
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
at that point the employer
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
can say well i'm sorry thank you very
 
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.390 align:start position:0%
can say well i'm sorry thank you very
much

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
but that is what is required under our
 
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.109 align:start position:0%
but that is what is required under our
contract

01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you can no longer have your
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
job here
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
at which
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
they could go to unemployment and other
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
mechanisms or this opens up the ability
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
for any medical institution or whatever
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
to say okay we accept that
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to keep you we can put you
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and do something else
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
which is not going to be in violation of
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
that contract
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
so we've given the employee
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
a new mechanism
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
right of conscience
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
and we also haven't gotten in between
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
now what will happen after that if
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
they're consistent
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
the the employer is consistent
 
01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:10.549 align:start position:0%
the the employer is consistent
with

01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
how they rule on each one of these
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
things sorry can't do it it's in
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
violation of our contract we will lose
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
all the funding we get from the federal
 
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.990 align:start position:0%
all the funding we get from the federal
government

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do something else with you
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it won't be in violation
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
or you can go to unemployment
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
up until about a month ago unemployment
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
and securities told us they had 200
 
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.309 align:start position:0%
and securities told us they had 200
people

01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
file for unemployment claims
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
through medical institutions because
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
unwillingness to take the vaccine
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage of those were
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
provided benefits as long as there was
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
consistency with what the employer did
 
01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:42.630 align:start position:0%
consistency with what the employer did
so

01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
we kind of very narrowly put this
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
together it's not as much as some people
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
would like trust me we have some people
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
say you didn't go far enough
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
we wanted you to make sure that that
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
person for the conscious has a job no
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
we can't do that ladies and gentlemen
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
because we would be putting this money
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
in in jeopardy
 
01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:03.750 align:start position:0%
in in jeopardy
so

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
in recap we gave them
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
individuals so you now have medical
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
religious right of conscience
 
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.390 align:start position:0%
religious right of conscience
but

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
we have not interfered with the contract
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
between the employer
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
and the federal government
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
and we've given everyone as best options
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
we can we didn't go overboard
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
trying to to
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
deal with some of the
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
negative things that came out of kovitt
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
which we all know
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
i call it the great overreaction
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
but we did the best we could
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i stand here today
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
this committee the majority of the
 
01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.630 align:start position:0%
this committee the majority of the
committee

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
did not and does not feel
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
that they have put two billion dollars
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
in jeopardy
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
is going to put medical institutions
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes out of
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
business it is a very narrowly written
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill and if it's not read correctly
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
it will look like we did do that
 
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
it will look like we did do that
um

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to support the
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendation about to pass
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%

01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
about to pass as amended on house bill
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
1210 this is a roll call vote members
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%

01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
1210 this is a roll call vote
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative soucy
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i believe that hb 1210 as
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
amended were to become law
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire would place our
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
health care providers in direct conflict
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine requirements of
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
descendants for medicare and medicaid
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
services potentially causing them to
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
forfeit billions of dollars of federal
 
01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:32.789 align:start position:0%
forfeit billions of dollars of federal
funding

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that house bill
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
1210 attempts to create a right of
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
conscience in the state that
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
a state law that is in direct conflict
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
with the federal vaccine requirements
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that the language in
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
hb 1210
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
requires that any exemption
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
request made either for religious
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
medical or right of conscience must be
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
granted which is in clear violation of
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
the federal vaccine requirements placing
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on our businesses and
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers once again putting
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
at risk billions of dollars in medicare
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
and medicaid funding
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that hb
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
1210 seeks to usurp the decision of
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
business and health care leaders in our
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
state from making the decisions they
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
believe are in the best interest of
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
their businesses health care
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
organizations employees
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
customers and patients but i now press
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
the red button to oppose the ought to
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
pass amendment motion so that another
 
01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:31.050 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank you mr speaker
 
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker mr speaker

walpole when while speaking yesterday on
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 1080 she said all persons
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
deserve the right of conscience and mrs
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
further mr speaker if i am happy knowing
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is exactly what this bill does
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
extending the right of conscience to all
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens in alignment with
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire constitution part one
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
article four
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
and end the rep of the rep from

walpole's beliefs
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that new hampshire
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
constitution part 1 article 4 reads and
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
the right of conscience unalienable
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
among these natural rights are some by
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
their very nature
 
01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.309 align:start position:0%
their very nature
unalienable

01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
unalienable
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
because no equivalent can be given or

this bill if enacted
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
would index
 
01:17:55.679 --> 01:17:56.470 align:start position:0%
would index

the

time for unemployment benefits
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
to be paid
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
to claimants under that system
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
indexing it to the state
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
average unemployment rate
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
the if this bill is enacted
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the maximum number of weeks of coverage
 
01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.669 align:start position:0%
the maximum number of weeks of coverage
for

01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
would be 16 weeks
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
if the unemployment rate
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
is three percent
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
with that time
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
increasing to 26 weeks
 
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.149 align:start position:0%
increasing to 26 weeks
in

01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
half point increments per week
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
up to 26
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
at an eight percent rate of unemployment
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
this bill has a good objective
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
to get people back to work but
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
it is a bad methodology for doing that
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire unemployment benefit
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
system already has built-in incentives
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
for people to get back to work
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
it only pays a portion of
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
the earnings claimants make prior to
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
going on unemployment
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
it has a 26-week limit
 
01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
it has a 26-week limit
and

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.149 align:start position:0%
and
claimants

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
claimants
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
must be actively looking for work and
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
rules in place to help ensure that this
 
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.790 align:start position:0%
rules in place to help ensure that this
happens

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
but the proof is in the pudding
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
the vast majority
 
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.790 align:start position:0%
the vast majority
of

01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
people who apply for and get
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
do not use all 26 weeks
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
so who are
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
the relatively few
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
people who do
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
well this bill would appear to assume
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
that they are freeloaders
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take advantage of
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
a golden goose
 
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.870 align:start position:0%
a golden goose
and

01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
the bill then assumes
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
that the time they should have for
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
finding a job should be linked to the
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
state unemployment rate
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is illogical
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate does not take into
 
01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.510 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate does not take into

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
certain geographical variances
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%

but most importantly
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take into account the
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances of the people
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
they ignore the possibility that someone
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
would choose to stay in a particular
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
field of endeavor rather than take
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
whatever is available on the market
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
and generally they
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
do not relate it all to
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
anomalies at any point in time in the

than others
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
often face challenges that most of us
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
aren't facing
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
their circumstances are peculiar to them

for this minority of job seekers

reducing the benefit period
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
because of a low unemployment rate
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
would have a cruel
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
and punitive effect
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%

this bill if enacted

i urge you to vote against

thank you mr speaker
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
hb 1337 is a common sense and rational
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
approach to unemployment that has proven
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
successful in the other states that
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
has implemented such a plan
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
businesses see their unemployment
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
compensation insurance rates decline
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
and it also allows the state's trust
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
fund to be strengthened remember
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
businesses are the ones who pay for all
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%

shining star of where this has happened
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
at one point during the 2008 finite
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
financial crisis
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
its trust fund had swung to a negative
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
1.7 billion dollar
 
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.510 align:start position:0%
1.7 billion dollar
loss

01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
after a few years of implementing this
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
type of a plan
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
it swung positive 3.9 for a net gain of
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
5.6 billion
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
and florida now enjoys the lowest
 
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.149 align:start position:0%
and florida now enjoys the lowest
unemployment

01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
insurance rates in the country
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
as the previous speaker mentioned this
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
does tie the length of time one can
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
receive the employment
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
compensation to the employ unemployment
 
01:24:51.199 --> 01:24:51.990 align:start position:0%
compensation to the employ unemployment
rate

01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
the maximum of 26 weeks does not change
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
and it does reduce
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh down to when whenever the
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is less than three
 
01:25:00.239 --> 01:25:03.750 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is less than three
percent

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend for a minute the
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
member has a right to be heard take your
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
one other issue that came up in uh
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
and was a few of the reasons why we had
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
changes in the the amendment
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
were the concerns over what would happen
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
in case of uh like the financial crisis
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
in 2008 or even the recent coveted
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
crisis where we had individuals on
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment for extended lengths of
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
time the the deputy commissioner
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
actually actually made the point that he
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't concerned about it only because
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government had stepped in to
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
extend those benefits
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
even with that i decided to put an
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
additional provision into the language
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
give the governor an extreme
 
01:25:53.199 --> 01:25:55.189 align:start position:0%
give the governor an extreme
circumstances

01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the covet 19 the the ability
 
01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.629 align:start position:0%
similar to the covet 19 the the ability
to

01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
adjust those
 
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
adjust those
rates

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
the good news about this there is
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely no financial downside risk
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
the only probability for a positive
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
upside for both the state's trust fund
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
and more importantly the businesses who
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
will see their unemployment taxes go
 
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.270 align:start position:0%
will see their unemployment taxes go
down

01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does have a pretty good
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
system now this bill would only make it
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
better i ask that you support the otp
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
motion by pressing the green button
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
report of what to pass as amended on

01:26:55.199 --> 01:27:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
motion before us is the majority
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended on house bill
 
01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended on house bill

01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan for
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
that our unemployment benefit program is
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
working effectively as it is
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that the
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
relatively low level of unemployment
 
01:27:58.159 --> 01:28:00.229 align:start position:0%
relatively low level of unemployment
benefits

01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
and the requirement to seek employment
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
provide a strong incentive for folks to
 
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.830 align:start position:0%
provide a strong incentive for folks to
seek

01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
seek
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
to return to work
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that a small group
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
of individuals find it very difficult to
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
find a new job
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
due to age
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
physical frailty
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
or family circumstances and therefore
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
need 26 weeks of benefits available
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of the unemployment rate
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
would i then
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
press the red button
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
so that another motion might be made
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
gee i recognize representative turcotte
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
if i know indexing the time the
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
unemployed may collect unemployment
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
compensation to the unemployment rate is
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
both rational and grounded in common
 
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.149 align:start position:0%
both rational and grounded in common
sense

01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
and if i also know the net effect of
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation would be to improve new
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire's unemployment trust fund
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
while also lowering the cost of
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums our new hampshire
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
businesses currently pay
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
then when i press the green button to
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%

yet

01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%

more
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
and and they should be able to do this
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
without interference from their employer
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
yet more than 75 percent of private
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
sector employees
 
01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.669 align:start position:0%
sector employees
respond

01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
to organizing drives with aggressive
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
these typically involve a series of
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
at the workplace where the employer
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
makes this case
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
against unionizations
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
these meetings are by their nature
 
01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.870 align:start position:0%
these meetings are by their nature
coercive

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
because workers must attend
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
an employee and employers make dire
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
claims about the consequences of
 
01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
claims about the consequences of
unionization

01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
unionization
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
and those who question the company line
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
can face discipline
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
or termination
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
and that happens
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
high-ranking company officials often
 
01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.590 align:start position:0%
high-ranking company officials often
attend

01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%

01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
and union activists are pointed out for
 
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.030 align:start position:0%
and union activists are pointed out for
derision

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
derision
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
these meetings are offered
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
followed by supervisor one on ones
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
as the primary means through which
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
employers deliver threats
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
and engage in interrogation
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
employers use these
 
01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.709 align:start position:0%
employers use these
supervisors

01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
supervisors
 
01:33:50.719 --> 01:33:52.149 align:start position:0%

one-on-one
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
to threaten workers with union activity
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
interrogate workers about their union
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
activity and that of co-workers in at
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
least 63 percent of the time
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
employees use survey surveillance in
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
about 14 of the time
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
there are laws against
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
firing employees for organizing union
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
but in more than 40 percent of the union
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
election campaign
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
laws however
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
the penalties for breaking the law are
 
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.310 align:start position:0%
the penalties for breaking the law are
minimal

01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
and there applied many months after
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
an employee is fired for the purpose of
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
employers own their business but they
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
don't own their employees
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
employees are free citizens
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
whose work
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
makes all of our lives better
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
and as such they are deserving of
 
01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:10.709 align:start position:0%
and as such they are deserving of
dignity

01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
dignity
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
and respect they should be free
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
from coercion or intimidation
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
claim that these meetings are an
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
exercise in free speech
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
but mandating a person or a group to
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
listen to your point of view is not free
 
01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
listen to your point of view is not free
speech

01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
speech
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's not free
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it is but it's not
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
when a group of individuals decides that
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.590 align:start position:0%
they're going to
[Music]

01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
make an attempt to form a union to be
 
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.030 align:start position:0%
make an attempt to form a union to be
organized

01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
organized
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's all fair and that's
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
but we all know and i'll use a
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
legal term here
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
that more often than not
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
in the trenches no one has clean hands
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
management may say something that is
 
01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
management may say something that is
against

01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
forming the union and say well you're
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
going to spend money on this and this
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
and you may not get that union on the
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
other hand we'll say yeah but we'll get
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
you this this and this
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
so then each one uses the media to see
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
what we can do that they can do to try
 
01:36:43.679 --> 01:36:44.470 align:start position:0%
what we can do that they can do to try
to

01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.590 align:start position:0%
to
dissuade

01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
dissuade
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
an opinion national labor relations
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
board is in place does their job gets
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
the bill was one-sided
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
said that management can't say anything
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
negative about a union well what about
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
why do we have a one-sided bill that was
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
that was a uh something that
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
the majority couldn't get past
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do something it needs
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
to be fair for all
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
that's what the national labor relations
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
board does
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
they try to get involved when things get
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
out of control and bring things back to
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
where they should be so we had a bill
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
that was not equal to both
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
we have an organization that is already
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
in place to do things
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately as i said
 
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:31.910 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately as i said
things

01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't always
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
aren't always pretty
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
when we're making legislation and
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're not always pretty
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
when uh
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
a group is trying to organize
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
it is not the best system but it's the
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
best one we have
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
and so far it seems to be working so i
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
would request that the members of the
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee or excuse me the members of
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
the house support the labor committee
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
position of inexpedient to legislate and
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
the question before the house is the
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
majority committee report of
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
inexpedience legislate are you ready for
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
the question a roll call has been
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
requested is that sufficiently seconded
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
it is not sufficiently seconded this
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
clearer

01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
house will be in order
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative bluchart is recognized
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%

mr speaker colleagues this is not the
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
proposed pay increase for the members of
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is these numbers are the number or
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the amounts that people lost
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
when they were working a job
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
and the and the owner sold the company
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
but did not
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
provide that their vacation hours would
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
be transferred to the next employer he
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
did not pay them out so they lost a
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
combined total of two thousand two
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty one dollars and forty
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
four cents
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
many of us think that's not that
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen that's the wrong way to
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
handle your employees that what should
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
happen is that you would transfer
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
everything to the new employer or pay
 
01:51:37.119 --> 01:51:43.189 align:start position:0%
everything to the new employer or pay
them

01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
18 days
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
144 hours at sixteen dollars and thirty
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
two cents per hour
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
twenty three hundred dollars fifty cents
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
twenty three fifty in eight cents
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
that is what another employee lost when
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
she was told today is your last day
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
you you may have vacation hours and this
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
cut this employer had the policy
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
of if you did not use all your vacation
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
hours during the year they would not it
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
would not say use or lose it but they
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
would pay you a very progressive company
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
they would pay you what you hadn't used
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
but it when terminated
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
they did not pay because this employee
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
unable to request the vacation time two
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
weeks in advance per the policy because
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
she had no notice of the of being laid
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
off she lost 2 300
 
01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.310 align:start position:0%
off she lost 2 300
now

01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
while the other people were fortunate to
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
have a job to go to this this person had
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
to go and collect unemployment
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
which i think probably hurt the
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
a small amount but it still impacted the
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.750 align:start position:0%
trust fund
so

01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
i've been working on this for a few
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
years now with my good friend from
 
01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.149 align:start position:0%
years now with my good friend from
hudson

01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
hudson
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
the man with the wonderful thai
 
01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.790 align:start position:0%
the man with the wonderful thai
collection

01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
collection
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
we began this quest because he was
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
interested in using or losing
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
the practice where an employer says you
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
know you get this much time in a
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
calendar year or your anniversary date
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
if you don't use it you lose it this
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill does nothing has nothing to do with
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
that that's practice remains does not
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
affect it
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
this bill only comes into effect
 
01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
when the company is sold
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
or there's a layoff and a permanent
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
layoff at that because we heard from the
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
people who paved the roads at the
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
seasonal employer if you lay them off
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know you're probably going to come
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
them back so this is a permanent the
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that we'll talk about later it
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
deals with that so it's only two special
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we think
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
when an employer writes their policy
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
that says i don't pay a termination
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
that termination could have many many
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
causes without you know where the
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
employee is blameless has not caused
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
trouble at work has done their job has
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
obviously been paying 16.32 cents an
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
hour had done a good job for the seven
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
years she worked there
 
01:54:01.119 --> 01:54:02.229 align:start position:0%
years she worked there
and

01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's just not it's just not right for
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
the employee to suffer
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
when they have no role in this it was
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
beyond their control and all of a sudden
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
what was on their pay stub whether it
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
was paper digital it's gone
 
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
so i asked you to overturn
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
the committee report so that we might
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment and pass that so i
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
can stop bothering you and i want to do
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
this again next year
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
does this member yield for a question
 
01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.030 align:start position:0%
does this member yield for a question
yes

01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
you may inquire
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you for
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh according to the
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill it says that this only takes effect
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
if the company is sold or transferred or
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
if it's a layoff if you have a worker
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
who has accrued a thousand or two
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars an unpaid time vacation
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
time sick time something like that
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
and they walk off the job they quit it
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to that
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
it does not all right thank you very
 
01:55:00.239 --> 01:55:05.350 align:start position:0%
it does not all right thank you very
much

01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%

report
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
employers choose many different ways
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
to offer enticements or benefits to
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
their employees to be good employers to
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
have good employees you must offer these
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
things some are health benefits
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
disability vacation time sick time
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
but the way each company does this is
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
very different depending on what kind of
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
a business they are if they're seasonal
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh they have uh bit busier times slower
 
01:55:39.119 --> 01:55:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh they have uh bit busier times slower
times

01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh whether they offer bonuses on a
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis for
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
exceptional production or any of these
 
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
things some say well you're going to get
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
two weeks vacation five sick days
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
and five personal days other companies
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
have said we're going to take that
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
entire amount we're going to give you
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
equivalent to three weeks to use what
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
however you choose whether it's vacation
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
time personal time or sick time
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
it varies
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the labor committee we try not to
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
tell businesses what to do and how to do
 
01:56:09.599 --> 01:56:10.950 align:start position:0%
tell businesses what to do and how to do
it

01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
for example my company chooses to
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
provide people with vacation time
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
and they want them to use the vacation
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
time i want them to be fresh i want them
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
to take that time with their families
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
and do what they need to do
 
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
to enjoy their lives
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year i don't want them
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
to carry it over to other times i want
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
them to use it
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
right but i will if they don't use their
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
sick time roll it over because something
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
terrible happens where you're sick for a
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
month you want them to have those
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
benefits those are decisions i make as
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
an owner
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
other other owners make other decisions
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
on how they're going to do it and we try
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
not to interfere
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
what the bill is trying to say is that
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
vacation time and sick time is earned
 
01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:58.390 align:start position:0%
vacation time and sick time is earned
money

01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's not a benefit but it's cash in hand
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
now we hear every once in a while
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
especially with some organized uh
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities or something where
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
someone will retire
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
and they haven't taken sick time in five
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
years or vacation in five years and they
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
walk away with a large check that's fine
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
because that's negotiation with the
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
union and that's what was developed
 
01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:21.910 align:start position:0%
union and that's what was developed
again

01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
labor committee not getting involved
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
with a private business or a private
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
municipality and their employees
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do the same thing here
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
we do not want to tell employers
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
that sick time unused sick time and
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
vacation time
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
is cash in hand to take with them if
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
that is not if that is the intent of the
 
01:57:41.199 --> 01:57:42.470 align:start position:0%
that is not if that is the intent of the
owner

01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
owner
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
then it's in the employer's manual
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
if it is not the intent of the employer
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be telling that they should
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
have to do that and that is the only
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
difference i don't disagree with the
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
previous speaker if a business wants to
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's up to the individual business the
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
individual owner and how they treat
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
their employees and what's their
 
01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:04.830 align:start position:0%
their employees and what's their
employee

01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
manuals and we don't like to interfere
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
so i would ask you to support
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation of it expedient to
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
legislate and i would like a division
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
roll call has been requested by who
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
represent request roll call and it is
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.280 --> 02:00:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
the house will come to order
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
the question is on the majority
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
committee report of an expediency
 
02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:12.709 align:start position:0%
committee report of an expediency
legislate

02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote the member from
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
newmarket representative cahill is
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
02:00:25.679 --> 02:00:27.830 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
that

02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the previous speaker my good friend
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
from manchester
 
02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:34.709 align:start position:0%
from manchester
that

02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
hour isn't these policies are set by the
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
employer that's that's a good situation
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
to have and i know that in many cases
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
most cases the employer will use
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
something else beside the law they'll
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
use their conscience something will tell
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
them what they should and shouldn't do
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
what's the right thing to do
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't always go that way and if
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
i know that this law
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
would only cover two very narrow
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances which i think most of us
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
will agree
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
were egregious they were not handled
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
well they would they would not fare to
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
the employer to the employee would i
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
then vote green sorry
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
red to defeat the itl so that another
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
representative infantine is recognized
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know there are
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
always circumstances that we can't
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
account for but not everything has to be
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
in law
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
and by a further note that we do not
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
tell businesses for the most part except
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
for safety type things
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh what to do then i would request that
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
you support the majority report of itl
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote if you are in
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
favor of the committee report you'll
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
press the green button if you're opposed
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
you'll press the red button voting
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:24.290 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:32.950 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
have all members present at an
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
172 having voted in the affirmative 164
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the negative the committee report is
 
02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:25.510 align:start position:0%
in the negative the committee report is
adopted

02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee on
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
legislative administration which was
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.719 --> 02:03:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
enact

02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
enact
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution that's
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
awkward wording providing that all
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
references to persons in the new
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution be neutral having
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
the following resolution resolved that
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
it is inexpedient to legislate
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative bob greene for the
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee having
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
considered the same being unable to
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
pass representative manny a special for
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
for what reason does a member rise
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
make a motion state in motion i'd like
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
to table cacr23
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
representative hill moves that cacr23 be
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
laid on the table are you ready for the
 
02:04:14.719 --> 02:04:15.669 align:start position:0%

speaker mr speaker if i know there is
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
little chance that
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
the necessary percentage will be
 
02:05:34.639 --> 02:05:36.390 align:start position:0%

and if i know the testimony was that
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
since each and every
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
change that would need be needed to be
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
included on and shown to the voter
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the ballot for this question would
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
be 12 pages long
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
leading to much confusion and wasted
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
resources would i now request and follow

thank you mr speaker mr speaker
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
if i know that this is a very important

if i know that this is a very important
cacr

02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
cacr
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this cacr has passed
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
this house before with a bipartisan
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
majority and it has also passed
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
the other body with a bipartisan
 
02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:24.149 align:start position:0%

majority
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
that back in 1998 56 percent of voters
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
have voted in favor of the cacr and i
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
believe we've come a long way since 1998
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that today we would
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
have had the
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
requisite support from the population to
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
pass the caacr would i now press the red

02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay cr
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
cacr23 on the table
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%

so

02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:31.990 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%

this house
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
for insurrection and rebellion would be
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
a very
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
difficult task
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill is vague
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
the language is poor and there's no
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
procedure outlined for removal in the
 
02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:00.069 align:start position:0%

bill
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
could be used
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
as a political weapon
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
by one party
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
against the other
 
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
would i vote with the majority of
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
legislative administration
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
02:11:34.030 --> 02:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
disqualification clause of the 14th
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment already prohibits those who
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
engage in insurrection
 
02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599 align:start position:0%
and rebellion from holding any public
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
office and at this time even without the
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
a member can be removed or not seated
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the new hampshire
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
constitution gives the new hampshire
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
house under part 2 article 14
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire senate under part
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
2 article 29 the sole authority to rule
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
on the qualifications of their members
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
but if i know that there is no authority
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
under current statute to call a special
 
02:12:20.709 --> 02:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
election if either body disqualified a
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
member for violating the 14th amendment
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore an entire district
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
of this house or if the other body could
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
remain unrepresented for an entire
 
02:12:30.719 --> 02:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
remain unrepresented for an entire
biennium

02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%

02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
we can ensure that all of our citizens
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
the question is whether lay house bill
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%

mr speaker if i know that in the long
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
history of the new hampshire general
 
02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:54.950 align:start position:0%

court

court
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
the membership
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the joint fiscal committee
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
has not historically been
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
a partisan issue
 
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
that the composition of that committee
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
has historically followed the same
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
proportional representation as other
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
committees in both chambers
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
however if i also know
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately in recent years
 
02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
the membership count and the party
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
balance on that committee has become a
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
partisan issue
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
and the process
 
02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
is no longer working and that the
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
parties are no longer balanced on that
 
02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:30.950 align:start position:0%
parties are no longer balanced on that
committee

02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know mr speaker that the
 
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is not about any
 
02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:37.030 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is not about any
current

02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:27:39.429 --> 02:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
issues but that it is looking towards
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
the future
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that moving forward
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
future legislatures our successors in
 
02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
these seats
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
4 6 20 years from now
 
02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
won't have to worry about the membership
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
of this joint fiscal committee becoming
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
a partisan football regardless of which
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
party is happening to be in control of
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
did you want to press the red button
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative ruler is recognized for
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
if i know the joint fiscal committee
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
made up of members from the house and
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
has been appointed
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
for 35
 
02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:29.990 align:start position:0%
for 35
years

02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
by the same mechanism since
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
1987 we have not had that problem
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
and if i know that changing who appoints
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
the members
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
will not affect the great work that's
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
currently done and has been done by the
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
and if i also know
 
02:28:53.349 --> 02:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
that the change is unnecessary because
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
they continue to work well together and
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
will continue to work well together
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of who appoints them
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
would i now vote with the majority
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the legislative administration and
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%

02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
the questions on the majority committee
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
report have been expedient to legislate
 
02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor you'll press the
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
green button if you're opposed you'll

02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i have been
 
02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
working on the article 5 issue for well
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
over a decade
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
and if i have been approached over the
 
02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:34.950 align:start position:0%
and if i have been approached over the
years

02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
by members of both parties and used as a
 
02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:38.950 align:start position:0%
by members of both parties and used as a
resource

02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
resource
 
02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to the nuance of article 5 of
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
the u.s federal constitution
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i am in firm agreement
 
02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
with the intent and principles behind
 
02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
however mr speaker
 
02:33:59.270 --> 02:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
if i have also found that the language
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
in this bill is unenforceable under
 
02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
and if i have found mr speaker that the
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
language in this bill is unfortunately
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
overly broad
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
and could interfere with the state's
 
02:34:12.399 --> 02:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
and could interfere with the state's
ability

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
ability
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
to engage in other interstate
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
conventions and pacts unrelated to
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
article 5 of the u.s constitution
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
for example mr speaker if this could
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the ability of new
 
02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire to participate in periodic
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
renegotiations of things like the
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
interstate driver's license compact
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
which we kind of need would i now press
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative wallace is recognized for
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
know that this party passed an identical
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill in 2015 by a bipartisan three to
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
one majority
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i further know that
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
the body on the other side of the wall
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
behind me passed the bill on on a voice
 
02:35:04.479 --> 02:35:05.349 align:start position:0%
behind me passed the bill on on a voice
vote

02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i further know that
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto was due to the need
 
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
for this legislation was in the future
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
and the future is now
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that we
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
are only a couple of states away from a
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
convention call with two states filing
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
resolutions just in the time period
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
since this bill was introduced would and
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'll press the red button to stop this
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
tabling motion so another motion can be
 
02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:31.349 align:start position:0%
tabling motion so another motion can be
made

02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay house
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
bill 1170 on the table this is a roll
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
call vote
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor you'll be pressing
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
the green button if you're opposed
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
you'll be pressing the red button voting
 
02:36:12.130 --> 02:36:12.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:21.750 align:start position:0%

the house will attend to the state of
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
the vote

157 having voted in the affirmative 186
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
and the negative the motion
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
fails the question now is on the

02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
committee report about to pass with
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
amendment the member from seabrook
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative abramson is recognized to
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
mr speaker the last time that the house
 
02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
passed this bill
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
both sides admitted in hearings and on
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
the floor that unless any convention of
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
the states occurred in new hampshire
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
the event would probably be outside
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
the state's jurisdiction and the
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of our laws and have no
 
02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:41.990 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of our laws and have no
impact

02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
but out of nearly 200 conventions of the
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
states in our country's history and over
 
02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
200 state constitutional conventions
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
not one single delegate
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
has been recorded to have ever exceeded
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
their legislative commission
 
02:37:59.110 --> 02:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
at no time
 
02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
has either type of convention resulted
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
in a loss nor erosion of anything in any
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
state nor federal bill of rights
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
whenever conventions meandered outside
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
the scope of a delegate's commission
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
they have always returned to their
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
respective state legislatures to seek
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
guidance and were allowed to do so
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
the problem with this bill
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
is that it provides a false sense of
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
security to legislatures to legislators
 
02:38:23.439 --> 02:38:24.309 align:start position:0%
security to legislatures to legislators
sorry

02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
since 269 members of congress if we're
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
talking about an article 5 convention
 
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
269 members of congress can bypass our
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
state legislature voters to elect
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
delegates to a state ratifying
 
02:38:37.830 --> 02:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
convention who are committed to a no
 
02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:39.590 align:start position:0%
convention who are committed to a no
vote

02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
this house rejected that bill when i
 
02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
introduced it a few years ago
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
worse state law has
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
that the governor not the general court
 
02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
makes the appointments to conventions of
 
02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
the states such as with the uniform law
 
02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:56.230 align:start position:0%
the states such as with the uniform law
commission

02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
state legislatures make those
 
02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
appointments themselves still worse is
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
that if this bill
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
if it were successful in binding any
 
02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
delegate would automatically take our
 
02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:08.389 align:start position:0%
delegate would automatically take our
delegate

02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
delegate
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
out of the debate on any proposed
 
02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment if someone
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
discovered structural or constitutional
 
02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
issues since they wouldn't be allowed to
 
02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
vote on an amendment to the amendment or
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
any change to the amendment late
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
proposals at that convention of states
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
could not raise the debt ceiling without
 
02:39:30.630 --> 02:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
a the ascent of three quarters of state
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
legislatures or limiting the scope of
 
02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
spending cuts in a balanced budget
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
amendment which we're two states away
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
from now
 
02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
might prevent our delegate from voting
 
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the matter
 
02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is the worst idea since the
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
cia spent 20 million dollars on studies
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
to find out whether human beings had
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
psychic powers if we'd had psychic
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
powers we'd have known to itl this bill
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
the member from durham representative
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
horrigan is recognized to speak against
 
02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:08.399 align:start position:0%

pi but plans have changed but
um

02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:23.830 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
the main problem with this bill is that
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh totally unnecessary um our an
 
02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
article five convention is it's not
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
imminent it's not on the horizon um i
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
if one happens
 
02:40:38.469 --> 02:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
we'll have plenty of uh plenty of lead
 
02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
time to
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
craft a bill similar
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
well crafty bill covering the same
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
subject matter as this
 
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's not you know we're not going to
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
have one next week we're not you know
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have one
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
for quite some time if we have one at
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
all um
 
02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
but then the second problem is
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the rules for this
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
convention is even if it's a so-called
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
assembly of the states whatever body
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh convenes that amendment will set its
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
own rules they're probably
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to have nothing whatsoever
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
to do with the detail in this bill
 
02:41:13.439 --> 02:41:15.190 align:start position:0%
to do with the detail in this bill
and

02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
also the whole basic concept that we're
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to remove these delegates if
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
they approve an under a so-called what
 
02:41:24.550 --> 02:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
what the term is un
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
unapproved amendment
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
they'll have the same rights that we
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
have as members of the new hampshire
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
house the same rights as members
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
congress has those are guaranteed not
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
just by the us and state constitutions
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
but by common laws so
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
when we're on the floor of the
 
02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
convention the people of the our
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
district can't can't remove us just
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
because they don't like our vote at
 
02:41:46.150 --> 02:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
least and the same goat will same go for
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
those delegates regardless of whether
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's an article 5 convention could mean
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
by congress
 
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
or some other some other body
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
then finally let's say
 
02:41:57.990 --> 02:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
let's say they do let's say the body
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
does vote for some unapproved uh
 
02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
unapproved amendments um those still
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
have to be ratified by
 
02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
a super majority of the states that's
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult it's happened i think
 
02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:09.510 align:start position:0%
very difficult it's happened i think
only

02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
now i forget the exact number but i
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
think it's 26 times in
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
250 years
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
so anything that this convention passes
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be harmless unless it's
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
incredibly popular there's a very broad
 
02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:22.230 align:start position:0%
incredibly popular there's a very broad
consensus

02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we should change the constitution
 
02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
or even
 
02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
i suppose theoretically they could even
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh enact a new conversation constitution
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
people talk about the articles of
 
02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
convention the runaway convention
 
02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to just amend the
 
02:42:37.269 --> 02:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
articles of confederation that was a
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
convention that caused the us
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
constitution which has uh
 
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
served us well since 1789.
 
02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
the member from
 
02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
and the the member from manchester
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
already mentioned this but this bill
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
this particular version of it is so
 
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
broadly written it covers the members of
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
i believe there's 41 interstate compacts
 
02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with things as big as driver's
 
02:43:01.279 --> 02:43:02.870 align:start position:0%
dealing with things as big as driver's
licenses

02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
or things as small scale as our
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
interstate school districts in the
 
02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
rivendell school district and the
 
02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:09.429 align:start position:0%
rivendell school district and the
hanover

02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
hanover
 
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
the dresden school district in the
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
hanover area of the rivendell school
 
02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
district up in the upper valley the
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
connecticut river so this uh
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
bill is you know this bill is
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's premature
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
and it would have some very bad
 
02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
so we should uh
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
we should
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
we should overturn the octopass's
 
02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and itel today and we can
 
02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:32.870 align:start position:0%
amendment and itel today and we can
always

02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
always
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
revisit this once we know
 
02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
if there's a convention we'll plenty of
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
time to revisit it once we know what the
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
framework for the convention will
 
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.750 align:start position:0%
actually be
thanks

02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right we are at the final speaker
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
and a division was requested on this so
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
start migrating back
 
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
the member from danville representative
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
wallace is recognized to speak in
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative wallace waves off the pi
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
so this will be a division vote members
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:42.800 --> 02:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
peninsula

02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:59.349 --> 02:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
the question is on the majority
 
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee report of house bill 1170.
 
02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan is recognized
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:30.389 --> 02:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
so if i know that
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
hb 1170 is totally unnecessary no
 
02:46:37.110 --> 02:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention is going to happen
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know in the very near future may
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
happen someday but it's
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
it'll happen
 
02:46:44.710 --> 02:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
and if i do know it's premature we will
 
02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:45.510 align:start position:0%
and if i do know it's premature we will
know

02:46:45.510 --> 02:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
when such a convention is called we're
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to know
 
02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
well in advance we'll have plenty of
 
02:46:50.790 --> 02:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
time to
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
write another bill
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
if i know also this bill pr a lot of the
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
details in the bill are highly
 
02:46:58.230 --> 02:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
questionable in fact it's probably
 
02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:00.469 align:start position:0%
questionable in fact it's probably
unconstitutional

02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
02:47:00.479 --> 02:47:01.590 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
the

02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
members would have the same rights and
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as those of any other
 
02:47:06.790 --> 02:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislative body such as the us congress
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
or this house you know so
 
02:47:10.950 --> 02:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of the things in the bill are
 
02:47:13.030 --> 02:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
things that's just sort of the state
 
02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:14.150 align:start position:0%
things that's just sort of the state
cannot

02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
cannot do and
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
finally this also interferes with our
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
participation over 40 interstate
 
02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:22.469 align:start position:0%
participation over 40 interstate
compacts

02:47:22.469 --> 02:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be a problem if i know
 
02:47:25.830 --> 02:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
i apologize for leaving out the if i
 
02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
know so if i know this feels unnecessary
 
02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
if i know it's premature if i know it
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
adversely affects our participation over
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
40 interstate compacts

those districts
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%

don't even live in your district
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%

even live in your district
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%

04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation of inexpedient
 
04:29:35.830 --> 04:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
house bill 1046 seeks to change the
 
04:29:40.870 --> 04:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
process by which sullivan county
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
commissioners are elected
 
04:29:45.189 --> 04:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
for more than 30 years
 
04:29:46.469 --> 04:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
the county commissioners have been
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
elected by all the voters in the county
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
rather than just a district they
 
04:29:50.479 --> 04:29:51.910 align:start position:0%
rather than just a district they
represent

04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:29:54.710 --> 04:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
it is one of three counties
 
04:29:57.429 --> 04:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
carol stafford and sullivan which used
 
04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
this method
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
to elect the county commissioners
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to limit voters to only
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
those in the district the commissioner
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
seeks to represent
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
during the bill's hearing it was argued
 
04:30:11.110 --> 04:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners should be elected
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
only by those they will be representing
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
it was also mentioned the campaigning
 
04:30:19.830 --> 04:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
is expensive since they have to do
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the county rather than just
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
within the district
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
i wonder what the actual reason for
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
changing from at large the district is
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
is it representation or the cost of
 
04:30:32.159 --> 04:30:33.750 align:start position:0%
is it representation or the cost of
campaigning

04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
campaigning
 
04:30:35.910 --> 04:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
as previously stated carroll county has
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
been using the at large election
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
method for more than 30 years
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
it seems that the at-large method for
 
04:30:44.950 --> 04:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
electing commissioners is preferred by
 
04:30:47.110 --> 04:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
the voters in this county
 
04:30:49.189 --> 04:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
if this is the voter's wish then why
 
04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
should the method of voting be changed
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
have election be changed
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%

04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the bill ought
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
to pass representative richard tripp for
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee
 
04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee having
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
considered the same and being unable to
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
following resolution resolved that is
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate representative
 
04:39:24.869 --> 04:39:24.879 align:start position:0%
julie gilman for the minority of the
 
04:39:27.269 --> 04:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
committee the chair recognizes
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is yet another manipulation of
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
the definition of default budgets in
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
official ballot town meetings
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i know when you hear official town
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
ballot town meetings your eyes are going
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
to roll
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the and when you hear default budget
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's also going to make your eyes roll
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
but here we are again
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
the new language includes
 
04:40:13.990 --> 04:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
less any reduction to an appropriation
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
the governing body made in the proposed
 
04:40:17.910 --> 04:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
so this will now use three different
 
04:40:22.390 --> 04:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
budgets to calculate the default budget
 
04:40:25.110 --> 04:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
for the third fiscal year
 
04:40:27.910 --> 04:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 operating budget and
 
04:40:30.390 --> 04:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
default budgets are based on fiscal year
 
04:40:30.400 --> 04:40:32.868 align:start position:0%
default budgets are based on fiscal year
21.

04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
21.
 
04:40:34.868 --> 04:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
do we need more or less of something
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
have we overspent or underspent
 
04:40:36.638 --> 04:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
have we overspent or underspent
something

04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 2022 default default
 
04:40:42.390 --> 04:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
budget is based on the difference
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
between 21 and 22
 
04:40:45.280 --> 04:40:46.550 align:start position:0%
between 21 and 22
budgets

04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
21 and 22 budgets with the additions and
 
04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
subtractions as specified in the current
 
04:40:51.040 --> 04:40:53.270 align:start position:0%
subtractions as specified in the current
rsa

04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
the proposed fiscal year 23 budget and
 
04:40:58.708 --> 04:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
subsequent default are based on the
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
operating budget of fiscal year 22.
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
this bill includes contracts in its
 
04:41:07.030 --> 04:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
definition of the default budget
 
04:41:07.040 --> 04:41:08.628 align:start position:0%
definition of the default budget
calculation

04:41:08.628 --> 04:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
but in fact
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
the existing rsa there is a definition
 
04:41:15.270 --> 04:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
of contracts saying that contracts
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
previously approved in the amount so
 
04:41:18.000 --> 04:41:19.190 align:start position:0%
previously approved in the amount so
approved

04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
approved
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
are included in the default budget
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
for example in fiscal year 21 the voters
 
04:41:28.948 --> 04:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
approved a three-year contract at 20 000
 
04:41:30.628 --> 04:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
per year
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
during fiscal 20 year 22 a conservative
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
fiduciary decision offered the
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
municipality the ability to pay off that
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
last year of the contract that had been
 
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
approved at 20k
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
for 21 22 and 23.
 
04:41:48.310 --> 04:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill the proposed fiscal year
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
23 and its default budget
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
do not include that contract
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
appropriation because it hasn't been
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
because it's been paid off and is no
 
04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
longer needed in the budget
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
but the 20k as previously approved
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
contract included in fiscal year 2023
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
default budget because the voters
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
contracted an amount approved in 2021
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
20k for four-year contract paid off
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
no longer necessary but is necessary
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
because that's the definition of
 
04:42:20.000 --> 04:42:21.270 align:start position:0%
because that's the definition of
contracts

04:42:21.270 --> 04:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
04:42:23.110 --> 04:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
so the default budget is going to be
 
04:42:26.070 --> 04:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars more than the
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
proposed budget
 
04:42:30.550 --> 04:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
the new language in this bill conflicts
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
because it requires that change
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
and and doesn't include the money that
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
we would not have had to appropriate
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
there's an approved contract in the
 
04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
amount so approved but the voters
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
previously had not
 
04:42:47.670 --> 04:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
previously had approved it
 
04:42:50.310 --> 04:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
the circular calculation and confusion
 
04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
is one of the problems that the minority
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
had with the
 
04:42:56.070 --> 04:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
and do not agree with the ought to pass
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation and i asked for a
 
04:43:01.110 --> 04:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the member from
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
litchfield representative boehm to speak
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.070 --> 04:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
the reason for the municipal budget law
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
was that towns did not have a facility
 
04:43:20.310 --> 04:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
big enough to hold regular town or
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
school district meetings
 
04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
one town i know it had the tv set up
 
04:43:25.120 --> 04:43:26.070 align:start position:0%
one town i know it had the tv set up
between

04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
multiple places
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
so this was passed back i believe 95 and
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
was initially called sb2 so still
 
04:43:36.550 --> 04:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
reference to that sb2 towns and it will
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
only affect those towns that have passed
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
this and school district
 
04:43:43.750 --> 04:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is common sense if the
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
governing body reduces something in
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
their proposed operating budget they
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
must make the same reduction in the
 
04:43:50.400 --> 04:43:52.150 align:start position:0%
must make the same reduction in the
default

04:43:52.150 --> 04:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
default
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
the argument about contracts contracts
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
will be in both
 
04:43:58.948 --> 04:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
the proposed operating budget and the
 
04:44:03.270 --> 04:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
default budget so that's not an issue
 
04:44:03.280 --> 04:44:04.390 align:start position:0%
default budget so that's not an issue
but

04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
but after a while when the first time it
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
was passed for the first number of years
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
the default was always lower
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
than a proposed operating budget but
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
after a while certain associations
 
04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
and lawyers figure out a way by using
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
the wording of the law to manipulate the
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
default budget to make it higher than
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
the operating budget to ensure that the
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
budget will pass but that was not the
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
intent of the law
 
04:44:34.948 --> 04:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
and if you read the section 4013
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
roman 11 there c
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
is pretty much says it
 
04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
this is what's got to be on the
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
shall the local governing body political
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
suffer raise an appropriate operating
 
04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
budget so much and then it says
 
04:44:51.910 --> 04:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
should this article be defeated
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
then the default budget will be this
 
04:44:54.878 --> 04:44:56.868 align:start position:0%
then the default budget will be this
okay

04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:56.878 --> 04:44:57.750 align:start position:0%
okay
or

04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:44:59.590 --> 04:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
the governing body
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
may hold one special meeting in
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
accordance with this law to take the
 
04:45:07.430 --> 04:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
issue of a revised operating budget only
 
04:45:07.440 --> 04:45:08.470 align:start position:0%
issue of a revised operating budget only
so

04:45:08.470 --> 04:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
if your governing body your selectment
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
or your school board
 
04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
have a higher default budget
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
and it the
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
warrant passes are they going to have a
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
special meeting because they got more
 
04:45:24.070 --> 04:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
money than they asked for i don't think
 
04:45:24.080 --> 04:45:24.948 align:start position:0%
money than they asked for i don't think
so

04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:27.430 --> 04:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why they're manipulating the
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
default to be higher
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
what school district is going to follow
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
the law if for example not needing three
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
teachers they are removed from the
 
04:45:43.030 --> 04:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
proposed operating budget but left in
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
the default
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
of course the default is going to be
 
04:45:46.480 --> 04:45:47.750 align:start position:0%
of course the default is going to be
higher

04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
if the teacher's contract says they will
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
fund clubs and sports stipends for say
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
for twenty thousand but never spent more
 
04:45:57.270 --> 04:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
than fifteen thousand you guess that the
 
04:45:59.430 --> 04:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
proposed operating budget will be
 
04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand but the default will be
 
04:46:02.240 --> 04:46:03.990 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand but the default will be
twenty

04:46:03.990 --> 04:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
twenty
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
on the town side if every other year the
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
town buys two police cruisers but then
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
then one the next year
 
04:46:13.350 --> 04:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
guess what the year one will have two in
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
the default
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera you know this is not
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
common sense and
 
04:46:23.430 --> 04:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
for example in this year in my school
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
district the proposed operating budget
 
04:46:27.910 --> 04:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
is twenty three million seven hundred
 
04:46:27.920 --> 04:46:28.948 align:start position:0%
is twenty three million seven hundred
thousand

04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
the default is 24 million
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
of course how you people and the people
 
04:46:36.070 --> 04:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
did vote for the
 
04:46:37.830 --> 04:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget because the default was
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
higher and sometimes they say no and not
 
04:46:42.788 --> 04:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
realizing that they're spending more
 
04:46:42.798 --> 04:46:43.910 align:start position:0%
realizing that they're spending more
money

04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:46:43.920 --> 04:46:45.190 align:start position:0%
money
so

04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
and like i said before contracts
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
teachers contract will be an addition
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
not a reduction
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
in both contra and both the proposed so
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be higher because of
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
that the default is higher because of
 
04:46:59.840 --> 04:47:01.510 align:start position:0%
that the default is higher because of
manipulation

04:47:01.510 --> 04:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
manipulation
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
a division must be requested the members
 
04:47:12.390 --> 04:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
will take their seats
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested is that

thank you madam speaker
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
madam speaker if i know that hb 1070
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
conflicts with existing laws in numerous
 
04:48:44.320 --> 04:48:45.590 align:start position:0%
conflicts with existing laws in numerous
ways

04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
ways
 
04:48:47.590 --> 04:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know that default budgets do
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
not include previously approved
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
contracts such as bond agreements
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that this
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
oversight concerning contracts and bonds
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
will result in a tangle of confusion for
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
towns across the state
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%

that when you have an
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
issue where budgets continually
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
04:49:43.590 --> 04:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
the default budget comes out greater
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
than the operating budget
 
04:49:48.550 --> 04:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
how would you feel
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
if you're on a budget committee
 
04:49:53.910 --> 04:49:53.920 align:start position:0%

municipal and county government to which
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
was referred hb 1081 and act relative to
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
the dissolution of a village district
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
having considered the same report the
 
04:53:01.110 --> 04:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
same with the recommendation that the
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass represent
 
04:53:04.708 --> 04:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative richard tripped for the
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee having
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
considered the same being unable to
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report that the
 
04:53:14.788 --> 04:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
following resolution resolution resolved
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
that is inexpedient to legislate
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative jim maggiore for the
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative rung
 
04:53:31.030 --> 04:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
hb 1081
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
is one of those bills that tricks you
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
into thinking that an equivalency exists
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
that an action on one side must be met
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
with the same action on the other side
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
in this case that since only a simple
 
04:53:54.070 --> 04:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
majority is needed to form a village
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
district that the right thing to do is
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
to change the law so that only a simple
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
majority is needed to dissolve it
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
with village districts nothing could be
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
further from the truth
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
to illustrate my point i will use the
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
merrimack village district as an example
 
04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's my hometown municipal water
 
04:54:15.760 --> 04:54:16.868 align:start position:0%
it's my hometown municipal water
district

04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
it was founded by a simple majority to
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
supply municipal water to the residents
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
in merrimack
 
04:54:26.230 --> 04:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
at the time the vote was taken residents
 
04:54:28.628 --> 04:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
did not have municipal water
 
04:54:32.708 --> 04:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
nor did mvd have any assets or capital
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
nor did it have any employees
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
it was nothing but a dream to the voters
 
04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
of merrimack
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
in fact if that vote had failed
 
04:54:44.070 --> 04:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
merrimack residents would have been no

making the decision to dissolve those

04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
something to be taken lightly
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
certainly not lighter than a decision to

thank you madam speaker
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
hb 1081 really is a simple bill the
 
04:57:16.150 --> 04:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
purpose is to change the legal
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
requirement to dissolve a village
 
04:57:19.750 --> 04:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
district from a two-thirds majority of
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
legal voters to a simple majority of
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
legal voters
 
04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
the simple majority standard is what is
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
a village district should be no harder
 
04:57:34.230 --> 04:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
to dissolve than it was to create the
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
i have had concerns from people asking
 
04:57:44.070 --> 04:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
if the bill allows non-residents to vote
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
the answer is no the standard of voting
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
is like every other election in the
 
04:57:51.030 --> 04:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
state you must be a legally registered
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
voter and only those present and voting
 
04:57:55.510 --> 04:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
are counted that was a court case sugar
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
hill association versus lisbon 1962.
 
04:58:00.550 --> 04:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
during testimony i had questions
 
04:58:02.550 --> 04:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
comparing the bill to a bond
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
which has a two-third majority
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
requirement but was lowered to a
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
three-fifths majority requirement in
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
2020 by this legislature
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
the only way to answer answer the
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
question regarding bonding and village
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
district is that bonding and dissolving
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
a village district are entirely two
 
04:58:20.788 --> 04:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
different subjects
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
finally the minority blurb indicated
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
that the municipality would absorb the
 
04:58:26.788 --> 04:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
cost of the dissolved district which is
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
not correct rsa 5221 states clearly the
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
selectmen of the town or towns in which
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
the district was situated shall assess
 
04:58:38.150 --> 04:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
the taxes and betterment assessments in
 
04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
the same manner
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
as if the district had not been
 
04:58:41.200 --> 04:58:42.390 align:start position:0%
as if the district had not been
dissolved

04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
dissolved
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
to close this bill is about fairness to
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
the voter and i ask you to push green
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.230 --> 04:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
the question on the floor
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
is the adoption of the
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
majority committee report for ought to
 
04:58:59.190 --> 04:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
pass on hb1081
 
04:59:01.350 --> 04:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested
 
04:59:10.390 --> 04:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded
 
04:59:14.550 --> 04:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
yes that is sufficiently seconded
 
04:59:16.230 --> 04:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
the house will
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
the house will come to order
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:00:37.750 --> 05:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker madam speaker if
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
i know that dissolving a village
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
district is more than just erasing a
 
05:00:44.000 --> 05:00:45.190 align:start position:0%
district is more than just erasing a
line

05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that within the boundaries
 
05:00:49.990 --> 05:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
or lines of that village district the
 
05:00:51.590 --> 05:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
residents of that district may have
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
created their own public safety
 
05:00:53.120 --> 05:00:55.270 align:start position:0%
created their own public safety
departments

05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
departments
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
may have hired first responders and
 
05:00:57.600 --> 05:00:59.190 align:start position:0%
may have hired first responders and
employees

05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
may have built wastewater treatment
 
05:01:01.040 --> 05:01:02.390 align:start position:0%
may have built wastewater treatment
facilities

05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
may have installed infrastructure such
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
as sidewalks street lights parks
 
05:01:09.430 --> 05:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
recreation fields fire hydrants all as
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
permitted by law
 
05:01:13.270 --> 05:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this illusion of such
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
a district would mean that the
 
05:01:15.990 --> 05:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding community would then need to
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
absorb all the costs
 
05:01:20.948 --> 05:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
for that infrastructure employees
 
05:01:20.958 --> 05:01:22.070 align:start position:0%
for that infrastructure employees
maintenance

05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
and long-term payments
 
05:01:26.550 --> 05:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
then finally madam speaker if i know
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
that the disillusioned assist of the
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
district and said investment should
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
require a two-thirds majority of voters
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
rather than a simple majority
 
05:01:37.270 --> 05:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
then would you please vote red so that
 
05:01:40.708 --> 05:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank you
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%

thank you madam speaker if i know that
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
it takes a simple majority to create a
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
village district and i also know that it
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
should not be any harder to dissolve a
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
village district than it is to create
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button thank

excesses from big tech

the following resolution resolved that
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
it is inexpedient to legislate

and thank you members of the house

i rise to oppose
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
the inexpedient to a legislate
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
on this bill because
 
05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
there's really
 
05:09:36.550 --> 05:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
no reason
 
05:09:38.550 --> 05:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
to require
 
05:09:40.708 --> 05:09:40.718 align:start position:0%
half an acre
 
05:09:42.390 --> 05:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
or more
 
05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
for a single family house
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
served by water and sewer
 
05:09:49.830 --> 05:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why you couldn't have
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
one it's the requiring that's the
 
05:09:52.840 --> 05:09:54.470 align:start position:0%
one it's the requiring that's the
problem

05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:09:57.670 --> 05:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
land costs are a big part
 
05:10:01.110 --> 05:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the cost of a single family house
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
usually you say it's about 20 percent
 
05:10:07.190 --> 05:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
so as
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
people are building houses if i have to
 
05:10:10.080 --> 05:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
people are building houses if i have to
spend

05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
spend
 
05:10:14.708 --> 05:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars on a lot
 
05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to build build
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
a bigger
 
05:10:18.718 --> 05:10:20.550 align:start position:0%
a bigger
fancier

05:10:20.550 --> 05:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
fancier
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
more expensive house
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
on that lot
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
if we want to encourage
 
05:10:29.830 --> 05:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
the creation
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
of smaller houses
 
05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
at a lower cost
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that we can do
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
is stop
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
artificially requiring
 
05:10:40.638 --> 05:10:41.430 align:start position:0%
artificially requiring
big

05:10:41.430 --> 05:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
big
 
05:10:41.440 --> 05:10:42.948 align:start position:0%
big
lots

05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
lots
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it says you
 
05:10:45.200 --> 05:10:46.150 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it says you
can't

05:10:46.150 --> 05:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
can't
 
05:10:46.160 --> 05:10:47.670 align:start position:0%
can't
require

05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
a large lot
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
if it is served by water and sewer which
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
of course is a big important piece of
 
05:10:54.718 --> 05:10:55.670 align:start position:0%
of course is a big important piece of
that

05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:57.910 --> 05:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
because we all know that you need
 
05:11:00.230 --> 05:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
x amount of square footage to safely
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
have a well and septic
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
so this only applies to places that have
 
05:11:06.878 --> 05:11:08.230 align:start position:0%
so this only applies to places that have
municipal

05:11:08.230 --> 05:11:08.240 align:start position:0%

and sewer
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't preclude people from
 
05:11:15.750 --> 05:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
buying larger pieces of land
 
05:11:17.590 --> 05:11:17.600 align:start position:0%

05:11:20.948 --> 05:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
it just says
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
don't require
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
a really big piece of land
 
05:11:28.070 --> 05:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd remind you is that
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
if you look
 
05:11:29.280 --> 05:11:30.868 align:start position:0%
if you look
at

05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:11:33.750 --> 05:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
historic surveys of new hampshire towns
 
05:11:35.830 --> 05:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
the sanford insurance maps are the most
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
famous ones
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
and what you'll see is that
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
in most town centers
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
the lots are considerably smaller than a
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
half an acre when i did the survey for
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
the town i live in
 
05:11:50.550 --> 05:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
our average lot size
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
in the what you would think of as the
 
05:11:57.510 --> 05:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
village compact
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
is about
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
8 000 square feet
 
05:12:01.280 --> 05:12:02.550 align:start position:0%
8 000 square feet
so

05:12:02.550 --> 05:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:06.550 --> 05:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
this is not an unusual thing to have
 
05:12:08.550 --> 05:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
a smaller lot
 
05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty usual thing
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
and we need to stop requiring bigger
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
ones in places where they're not
 
05:12:15.840 --> 05:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
ones in places where they're not
required

05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%

requested

05:25:26.948 --> 05:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.190 --> 05:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:25:31.510 --> 05:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
vervo for parliamentary inquiry thank
 
05:25:33.750 --> 05:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
you madam speaker
 
05:25:36.310 --> 05:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
if i know that i voted on the prevailing
 
05:25:36.320 --> 05:25:37.510 align:start position:0%
if i know that i voted on the prevailing
side

05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
side
 
05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
but i also
 
05:25:41.990 --> 05:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the gavel came down quickly
 
05:25:43.510 --> 05:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
and perhaps
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
the true will of the body was not
 
05:25:45.680 --> 05:25:47.750 align:start position:0%
the true will of the body was not
determined

05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
determined
 
05:25:49.830 --> 05:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that the rightful and
 
05:25:51.990 --> 05:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
fair thing to do would be to allow the
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
division vote on the tabling motion
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
but also madam speaker if i believe
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
05:26:03.990 --> 05:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
that i do not support removing this bill
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
from the table
 
05:26:07.590 --> 05:26:07.600 align:start position:0%

05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
madam speaker if i know that we are in

all kinds to alleviate this crisis
 
05:26:48.788 --> 05:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
if i further know that hp 1087 would
 
05:26:51.430 --> 05:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
make it easier to build single-family
 
05:26:54.390 --> 05:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
homes in areas served by public water
 
05:26:58.390 --> 05:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
and sewer and if i know that doing so
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
would have zero impact on the beautiful
 
05:27:03.990 --> 05:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
rural parts of our state
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%

year this bill
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
tries to override local control by

forcing our towns and cities to accept

really

05:31:38.070 --> 05:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:31:39.990 --> 05:31:40.000 align:start position:0%

05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
and an accessory for each
 
05:31:44.868 --> 05:31:44.878 align:start position:0%

marvin gardens
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
will this require that towns accept a
 
05:31:55.910 --> 05:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
four-story high mini skyscraper like
 
05:31:57.670 --> 05:31:57.680 align:start position:0%

in the busier parts of elm street
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
and would buildings on elm street be
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
torn down and replaced with pairs of
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
duplexes contrary to the intent of the
 
05:32:17.590 --> 05:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
planners at city hall who put years and

towns like
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
towns like seabrook okay
 
05:32:27.990 --> 05:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't meant to be a joke but i guess
 
05:32:29.270 --> 05:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
towns like seabrook are already
 
05:32:32.708 --> 05:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
overloaded with apartment buildings and
 
05:32:34.310 --> 05:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
most people there are now dead set
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
against them i used to serve on my
 
05:32:37.670 --> 05:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
town's planning board and every single
 
05:32:39.270 --> 05:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
member of my planning board was opposed
 
05:32:43.590 --> 05:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:44.948 --> 05:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
should the state override the will of
 
05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
the voters also
 
05:32:47.910 --> 05:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
should towns like hampton falls and
 
05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
hampton be commanded by another top-down
 
05:32:52.310 --> 05:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all solution to replace
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
the suburbs with medium density
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%

overbuilt
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
would you want to explain to angry an
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
angry planning board and other land use
 
05:33:06.948 --> 05:33:06.958 align:start position:0%

into something that looks somewhat like

downtown lawrence
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
what will we tell our constituents when
 
05:33:20.310 --> 05:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
we see when they see their property tax
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
rates nearly double because of the
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
sudden need to add two police
 
05:33:26.948 --> 05:33:26.958 align:start position:0%

05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
to serve a state induced surge in
 
05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
migration and where will already
 
05:33:35.910 --> 05:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
overworked water departments find more
 
05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
water and bigger pipes in towns that are
 
05:33:39.990 --> 05:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
already at their limit
 
05:33:41.430 --> 05:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
or six million dollars for a new
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility how will
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
our emergency rooms and fire departments
 
05:33:46.948 --> 05:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
deal with a large influx of people
 
05:33:48.628 --> 05:33:48.638 align:start position:0%

05:33:57.750 --> 05:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
only 10 feet apart sometimes not far
 
05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
enough apart
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
for our fire trucks in some of these
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
small towns
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is the worst idea since
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
congress forced us to pay for giant pink
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
flatulence balloons that cows have to
 
05:34:10.230 --> 05:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
have strapped on to combat global

05:34:18.150 --> 05:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
for what purpose does the member rise to
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
05:34:21.670 --> 05:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
please state your motion yes i'd like to
 
05:34:24.628 --> 05:34:24.638 align:start position:0%

madam speaker members of the house if i
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
know that new hampshire is short
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 20 and 30 000 housing
 
05:37:34.480 --> 05:37:35.510 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 20 and 30 000 housing

units
 
05:37:37.510 --> 05:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
05:37:40.548 --> 05:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
that our restrictive zoning is part of
 
05:37:43.830 --> 05:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
the reason that we cannot build more
 
05:37:46.948 --> 05:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
units and if i know

four units
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the federal home
 
05:37:57.910 --> 05:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
administration believes that four units
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
is a house
 
05:38:02.948 --> 05:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
would i now vote red
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
against the tabling motion
 
05:38:08.548 --> 05:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
so that we can debate this bill
 
05:38:11.030 --> 05:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:38:13.270 --> 05:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
the question is on the tabling motion
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
for hb1177
 
05:38:18.310 --> 05:38:18.320 align:start position:0%

05:38:20.470 --> 05:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
favor you will press the green button if
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
you are opposed you will press the red

seconds

05:38:58.230 --> 05:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:23.670 --> 05:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:25.270 --> 05:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
have all members present had the
 
05:39:27.270 --> 05:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote the house will
 
05:39:33.470 --> 05:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
167 in the affirmative 157 in the
 
05:39:51.750 --> 05:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:51.760 --> 05:40:06.868 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
for what reason does a member rise
 
05:40:12.070 --> 05:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
um i like the remarks i move that the
 
05:40:14.390 --> 05:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
remarks of the previous debate be added
 
05:40:19.590 --> 05:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
i move that the remarks of the previous
 
05:40:22.868 --> 05:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
debate be
 
05:40:25.350 --> 05:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
entered into the permanent journal
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
holy feedback
 
05:40:30.708 --> 05:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
okay so i already heard an objection the
 
05:40:31.990 --> 05:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
motion is
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
to print the remarks of the previous
 
05:40:35.750 --> 05:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
debate in the permanent journal
 
05:40:37.910 --> 05:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
and a division has been requested
 
05:40:39.270 --> 05:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
members should probably still be in
 
05:40:43.670 --> 05:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
their seats but this is a division vote
 
05:41:23.350 --> 05:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:00.240 --> 05:42:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
graham

05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
all right it's time for members to go to
 
05:42:20.788 --> 05:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:21.990 --> 05:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to print the
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
remarks of the previous debate in the
 
05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
permanent journal this is a division
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:45.600 --> 05:42:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:42:47.670 --> 05:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:42:49.670 --> 05:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
so like i said this is to print the
 
05:42:51.270 --> 05:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
remarks of the previous debate in the
 
05:42:53.350 --> 05:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
permanent journal if you're in favor
 
05:42:54.868 --> 05:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
you'll press the green button if you're

include only the first year payment of a
 
05:53:56.070 --> 05:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
multi-year bond in the cap calculation
 
05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
disregarding any debt service
 
05:54:00.788 --> 05:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear what happens after
 
05:54:03.510 --> 05:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
the initial payment or what may accrue
 
05:54:05.510 --> 05:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
the following years
 
05:54:07.670 --> 05:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
capital bonds are voted separately from
 
05:54:09.670 --> 05:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
operating budgets
 
05:54:11.510 --> 05:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the first year and then if
 
05:54:13.670 --> 05:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
approved are appropriated in the
 
05:54:16.948 --> 05:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
subsequent operating budgets
 
05:54:18.868 --> 05:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
a further concern is that the bond
 
05:54:21.030 --> 05:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
ratings may be affected by the lack of
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
guaranteed payments that were not
 
05:54:25.750 --> 05:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
considered with this bill
 
05:54:28.150 --> 05:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
it is also it also has no provision for
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
the possibility of rising inflation
 
05:54:33.430 --> 05:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is not as clarifying as it
 
05:54:35.670 --> 05:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
says it wanted to be
 
05:54:38.470 --> 05:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
it leads to more questions than answers
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
for these reasons the minority found
 
05:54:42.788 --> 05:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate and
 
05:54:49.830 --> 05:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
the member from brookline representative
 
05:54:53.190 --> 05:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
power is recognized to speak in support
 
05:55:00.230 --> 05:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:55:04.708 --> 05:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i rise in support
 
05:55:06.708 --> 05:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
of the committee recommendation of ought
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
to pass on house bill 1194.
 
05:55:13.110 --> 05:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
year after year new hampshire citizens
 
05:55:16.310 --> 05:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
are faced with increased local spending
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
and escalating tax bills
 
05:55:21.270 --> 05:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
making it extremely difficult for some
 
05:55:24.708 --> 05:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet in the granite state
 
05:55:27.750 --> 05:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1194 helps to address the
 
05:55:31.990 --> 05:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
problem of escalating taxes resulting
 
05:55:34.948 --> 05:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
from unsustainable spending at the local
 
05:55:34.958 --> 05:55:36.150 align:start position:0%
from unsustainable spending at the local
level

05:55:36.150 --> 05:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:55:39.190 --> 05:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
currently a tax cap may be adopted with
 
05:55:42.070 --> 05:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
a three-fifth super-majority vote by the
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
legislative body and
 
05:55:47.270 --> 05:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
with just a simple majority vote the
 
05:55:51.270 --> 05:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
legislative body can override a tax cap
 
05:55:54.788 --> 05:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses this problem
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
since the purpose of a tax cap is to
 
05:56:00.390 --> 05:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
ensure fiscal responsibility and
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
prudence in spending is therefore
 
05:56:06.230 --> 05:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable that any proposed spending
 
05:56:09.350 --> 05:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
which exceeds the tax cap should
 
05:56:11.990 --> 05:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
have a higher standard to pass
 
05:56:14.628 --> 05:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
than just a simple majority
 
05:56:17.430 --> 05:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
and furthermore since a super majority
 
05:56:20.548 --> 05:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
is required to adopt a tax cap
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense that a super
 
05:56:25.350 --> 05:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
majority should be required to override
 
05:56:27.110 --> 05:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
a tax cap
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
requiring a three-fifth super-majority
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
override will ensure
 
05:56:37.350 --> 05:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
that any spending that exceeds a tax cap
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
is both warranted and is supported by
 
05:56:43.590 --> 05:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
the legislative body
 
05:56:43.600 --> 05:56:45.030 align:start position:0%
the legislative body
additionally

05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
05:56:47.430 --> 05:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that in this
 
05:56:50.948 --> 05:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
bill in no way limits the legislative
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
body's authority
 
05:56:55.910 --> 05:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
to either increase or decrease the
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
amount of any single appropriation or
 
05:57:04.310 --> 05:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
the total amount of all appropriations
 
05:57:06.470 --> 05:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
05:57:07.830 --> 05:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:57:09.270 --> 05:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
puts teeth
 
05:57:12.230 --> 05:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
into a toothless tax cap
 
05:57:15.670 --> 05:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it provides an essential tool
 
05:57:18.150 --> 05:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire taxpayers to more
 
05:57:18.160 --> 05:57:19.590 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire taxpayers to more
effectively

05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
manage unsustainable spending and keep
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
local taxes under control
 
05:57:29.350 --> 05:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i urge my fellow
 
05:57:31.270 --> 05:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%

05:58:00.470 --> 05:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative trojan requests a roll
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
call is that sufficiently seconded it is
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.708 --> 05:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
faster we get to our seats faster we can

06:00:42.948 --> 06:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:47.590 --> 06:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:49.190 --> 06:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
the questions on the majority committee
 
06:00:50.548 --> 06:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
report of
 
06:00:52.868 --> 06:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
ought to pass representative maggiore is
 
06:00:57.190 --> 06:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
06:01:01.910 --> 06:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
know that this bill is not merely a bill
 
06:01:04.070 --> 06:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
to create the voting percentage to
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
create a local tax cap
 
06:01:09.110 --> 06:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
and if mr speaker if i know that the
 
06:01:11.270 --> 06:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
additional language in this bill
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
requires that only the first year
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
payment on a bond
 
06:01:18.470 --> 06:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
long-term contract municipal project
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
capital improvement project are the
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
numbers that should be used in the
 
06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
analysis for the tax cap and not the
 
06:01:27.030 --> 06:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent years
 
06:01:28.948 --> 06:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
and if mr speaker if i know that this
 
06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill only applies to seven
 
06:01:34.230 --> 06:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
out of the 234 municipalities and school
 
06:01:36.470 --> 06:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
units in new hampshire and that none of
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
those communities testified about a
 
06:01:40.868 --> 06:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
problem within their communities and
 
06:01:42.628 --> 06:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
finally mr speaker if i know that we
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
should preserve the local authority
 
06:01:47.430 --> 06:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
that legislative bodies and school
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
districts need to negotiate their own
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
prudent funding without any additional
 
06:01:54.788 --> 06:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
interference from the state then would i
 
06:01:57.830 --> 06:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
press the red red button to overturn the
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
otp so that a different motion can be
 
06:02:03.990 --> 06:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative silver is recognized for
 
06:02:10.230 --> 06:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:12.548 --> 06:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
know that across the granite state
 
06:02:17.030 --> 06:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are met year after year
 
06:02:20.230 --> 06:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
with increasing local budgets in taxes
 
06:02:23.110 --> 06:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
in towns cities and schools
 
06:02:25.910 --> 06:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
resulting in constantly escalating tax
 
06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
bills year after year making it
 
06:02:30.470 --> 06:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
difficult for our constituents and their
 
06:02:33.430 --> 06:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
families to make their ends meet
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that local tax
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
caps have been enacted in many parts of
 
06:02:38.470 --> 06:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to moderate the increasing
 
06:02:43.590 --> 06:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
tax burdens on our families
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that current
 
06:02:45.680 --> 06:02:46.548 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that current
law

06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:02:48.470 --> 06:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
enables the voters of a town or district
 
06:02:50.708 --> 06:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
to adopt a local tax cap
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
by a three-fifth super majority
 
06:02:55.590 --> 06:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
but allows the legislative body to
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
override the tax cap
 
06:03:00.548 --> 06:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
by but a simple majority vote
 
06:03:03.110 --> 06:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that hb 1194
 
06:03:05.350 --> 06:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
would change the vote to override
 
06:03:07.190 --> 06:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap
 
06:03:09.030 --> 06:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
from a simple majority
 
06:03:11.670 --> 06:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
to the same three-fifths super majority
 
06:03:15.030 --> 06:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
now required to put the tax cap in plate
 
06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
06:03:19.110 --> 06:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
and if i know that hb 1194 would provide
 
06:03:21.030 --> 06:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire taxpayers
 
06:03:23.190 --> 06:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
with an important tool
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
that can enable them to more effectively
 
06:03:25.440 --> 06:03:26.390 align:start position:0%
that can enable them to more effectively
manage

06:03:26.390 --> 06:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
manage
 
06:03:28.788 --> 06:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
unsustainable spending at the local
 
06:03:31.750 --> 06:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
level in an effort to keep tax increases
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
at more reasonable
 
06:03:36.070 --> 06:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
levels then would i press the bright
 
06:03:37.750 --> 06:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
green button

bill before and we've rejected it i hope
 
06:10:16.868 --> 06:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
we'll agree that we should do so again
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
it seeks to limit the authority of city

elected them expect them to carry out
 
06:10:30.628 --> 06:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
city councils have brought authority
 
06:10:35.590 --> 06:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
under rsa 47 17. to regulate activities
 
06:10:38.788 --> 06:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
taking place within their jurisdictions
 
06:10:43.190 --> 06:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
hb 1268 proposes to delete a key phrase
 
06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
from section 15 of that law
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
that allows municipalities to make any
 
06:10:51.590 --> 06:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
regulations that and i quote
 
06:10:53.830 --> 06:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
may seem needful for the well-being of
 
06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
the city
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
substituting it with and i quote again
 
06:11:02.310 --> 06:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
to regulate nuisances that interfere
 
06:11:04.470 --> 06:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
with the use and enjoyment of one's
 
06:11:04.480 --> 06:11:06.310 align:start position:0%
with the use and enjoyment of one's
property

06:11:06.310 --> 06:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:11:09.510 --> 06:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
this is classic government overreach
 
06:11:12.788 --> 06:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
not only does hb 1268
 
06:11:15.590 --> 06:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
assume that we in the legislature no
 
06:11:17.350 --> 06:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
more than the local officials our
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
citizens elect
 
06:11:22.470 --> 06:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
it ports forth the notion
 
06:11:24.948 --> 06:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
that enjoyment property is all that
 
06:11:24.958 --> 06:11:26.548 align:start position:0%
that enjoyment property is all that
matters

06:11:26.548 --> 06:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
matters
 
06:11:28.470 --> 06:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
public health measures
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
regulations to design protect citizens
 
06:11:33.270 --> 06:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
and help them thrive
 
06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
those are trivial and in fact they
 
06:11:37.830 --> 06:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
should be prohibited
 
06:11:40.070 --> 06:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended
 
06:11:44.788 --> 06:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
undermines the essence of rsa 4717.
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
which empowers local elected officials
 
06:11:51.030 --> 06:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
to protect the people they serve
 
06:11:53.910 --> 06:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
and not just their property
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it subverts existing law further
 
06:11:59.110 --> 06:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
by preventing city councils from
 
06:12:01.750 --> 06:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
carrying out the duties they are sworn
 
06:12:04.310 --> 06:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
to perform
 
06:12:06.230 --> 06:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
i have no doubt
 
06:12:08.708 --> 06:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
that all of us in this chamber are very
 
06:12:08.718 --> 06:12:10.070 align:start position:0%
that all of us in this chamber are very
wise

06:12:10.070 --> 06:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
wise
 
06:12:12.548 --> 06:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
but are we better equipped to know at
 
06:12:14.070 --> 06:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
the local level
 
06:12:16.868 --> 06:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
what citizens in the 13 cities across
 
06:12:19.110 --> 06:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
our state want
 
06:12:21.350 --> 06:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
i really don't think so
 
06:12:24.390 --> 06:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
and that is why they chose some of us
 
06:12:26.470 --> 06:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
to serve at the state level
 
06:12:28.470 --> 06:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
while expecting the counselors they
 
06:12:31.270 --> 06:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
elected locally to understand their
 
06:12:34.310 --> 06:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
needs and ensure their safety
 
06:12:38.070 --> 06:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote itl yet again on this
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
newest version of state house overreach
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded
 
06:12:57.510 --> 06:12:57.520 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
06:13:12.470 --> 06:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is simple it fixes vague
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
language about what kinds of health
 
06:13:14.558 --> 06:13:16.310 align:start position:0%

bylaws
 
06:13:18.230 --> 06:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
city councils may pass
 
06:13:20.868 --> 06:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
it inserts a definition about public
 
06:13:23.350 --> 06:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
health nuisances into the statute to
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
clear up vagaries
 
06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
it only pertains to one sentence in the
 
06:13:31.590 --> 06:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous section about city council
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
bylaws not the whole chapter
 
06:13:36.390 --> 06:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
was developed by the new hampshire
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
public health nuisance task force to
 
06:13:42.470 --> 06:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
address this sometimes confusing subject
 
06:13:42.480 --> 06:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
address this sometimes confusing subject
matter

06:13:43.430 --> 06:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
matter
 
06:13:45.990 --> 06:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
it leaves intact the broad authority
 
06:13:49.110 --> 06:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
that city councils have enjoyed to make
 
06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
local issue bylaws
 
06:13:53.830 --> 06:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
it covers everything from septic codes
 
06:13:55.830 --> 06:13:55.840 align:start position:0%

06:13:55.840 --> 06:13:57.270 align:start position:0%

everything
 
06:13:59.270 --> 06:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
that is a local issue
 
06:14:01.750 --> 06:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
but it ensures that broader public
 
06:14:03.190 --> 06:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
06:14:06.150 --> 06:14:06.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
06:14:49.110 --> 06:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this bill
 
06:14:51.590 --> 06:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
creates government overreach by limiting
 
06:14:55.430 --> 06:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
the local control so crucial to each and
 
06:14:57.990 --> 06:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
every city council and if mr speaker i
 
06:15:00.470 --> 06:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
know that the current statutory language
 
06:15:01.590 --> 06:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
which is
 
06:15:03.990 --> 06:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
make any bylaws or ordinance which may
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
seem for the well-being of the city
 
06:15:09.430 --> 06:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
has served our cities well
 
06:15:10.548 --> 06:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
06:15:10.558 --> 06:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
and that the
limiting

06:15:11.590 --> 06:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
language to be amended would
 
06:15:16.868 --> 06:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
limit the statute to the enjoyment of
 
06:15:16.878 --> 06:15:18.548 align:start position:0%
limit the statute to the enjoyment of
property

06:15:18.548 --> 06:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:15:19.990 --> 06:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that the
 
06:15:21.750 --> 06:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
current statute ensures that local
 
06:15:23.430 --> 06:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
elected officials in our cities are
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
empowered to protect
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
all the people that they serve and not
 
06:15:29.590 --> 06:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
just their property then mr speaker
 
06:15:31.030 --> 06:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
would i vote red
 
06:15:32.390 --> 06:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
on the current motion so that a
 
06:15:34.070 --> 06:15:34.080 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
06:15:45.830 --> 06:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill as amended
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
clarifies and better defines how city
 
06:15:50.628 --> 06:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
councils make laws
 
06:15:54.788 --> 06:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
and if i know that dhhs is best staffed
 
06:15:56.628 --> 06:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
with expertise
 
06:15:58.868 --> 06:15:58.878 align:start position:0%

and as i know
 
06:16:04.470 --> 06:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
a city by city approach
 
06:16:07.030 --> 06:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
would create a confusing patchwork of
 
06:16:08.548 --> 06:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
differing laws
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%

06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you members
 
06:19:29.670 --> 06:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
06:19:33.510 --> 06:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh this bill seeks to change the rules
 
06:19:35.510 --> 06:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
under which the housing appeals board
 
06:19:37.750 --> 06:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
does its work
 
06:19:40.390 --> 06:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i am
 
06:19:43.430 --> 06:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
asking you not to support the committee
 
06:19:43.440 --> 06:19:44.628 align:start position:0%
asking you not to support the committee
report

06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
report
 
06:19:47.270 --> 06:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
because the housing appeals board has
 
06:19:49.190 --> 06:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
only been in operation for about two
 
06:19:49.200 --> 06:19:50.150 align:start position:0%
only been in operation for about two
years

06:19:50.150 --> 06:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:19:52.468 --> 06:19:52.478 align:start position:0%
and so far
 
06:19:54.788 --> 06:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's working okay
 
06:19:57.590 --> 06:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is say that
 
06:19:57.600 --> 06:19:58.788 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is say that
some

06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:19:58.798 --> 06:20:00.468 align:start position:0%
some
local

06:20:00.468 --> 06:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
local
 
06:20:03.270 --> 06:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
land some local boards
 
06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
and elected officials shall not be
 
06:20:09.270 --> 06:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
considered when you're when the housing
 
06:20:11.990 --> 06:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
appeals board is looking at whether to
 
06:20:15.270 --> 06:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
approve or not approve an appeal
 
06:20:18.230 --> 06:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
and while it seems sensible that maybe
 
06:20:18.240 --> 06:20:19.430 align:start position:0%
and while it seems sensible that maybe
only

06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
only
 
06:20:22.150 --> 06:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
the planning board and the zba should be
 
06:20:23.430 --> 06:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
06:20:27.110 --> 06:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
since select boards have to do with
 
06:20:29.670 --> 06:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
whether roads are open and closed and
 
06:20:29.680 --> 06:20:31.350 align:start position:0%
whether roads are open and closed and
what

06:20:31.350 --> 06:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:20:34.230 --> 06:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
classification roads have and road
 
06:20:37.910 --> 06:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
classification does in fact affect
 
06:20:37.920 --> 06:20:39.030 align:start position:0%
classification does in fact affect
how

06:20:39.030 --> 06:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:20:41.990 --> 06:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
land use can be done
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i would respectfully ask you for that
 
06:20:48.868 --> 06:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
reason to vote against the ought to pass
 
06:20:51.990 --> 06:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
so that all of the boards and elected
 
06:20:52.000 --> 06:20:53.430 align:start position:0%
so that all of the boards and elected
officials

06:20:53.430 --> 06:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
officials
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
that and appointed officials that have
 
06:20:57.190 --> 06:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
to do with decisions
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
concerning land use may continue
 
06:21:04.468 --> 06:21:04.478 align:start position:0%
to be part of the housing appeals board
 
06:21:07.030 --> 06:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
process thank you
 
06:21:12.468 --> 06:21:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:14.628 --> 06:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:21:16.708 --> 06:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
as you've heard this bill relates to the
 
06:21:19.430 --> 06:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board h.a.b the hab
 
06:21:21.510 --> 06:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
board it was formed sort of like the
 
06:21:24.070 --> 06:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals it's a
 
06:21:27.110 --> 06:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
three-person board appointed supposed to
 
06:21:30.150 --> 06:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
be people of expertise in the area and
 
06:21:32.628 --> 06:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's to provide an avenue for appeal
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
from local decisions
 
06:21:37.670 --> 06:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
this board is a lesson in legislative
 
06:21:41.110 --> 06:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
experience much like committees getting
 
06:21:43.270 --> 06:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
a bill and having it be in their
 
06:21:46.868 --> 06:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the hab board was actually
 
06:21:49.190 --> 06:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
created in 2019
 
06:21:51.830 --> 06:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
in what some people referred to as the
 
06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
christmas tree bill
 
06:21:53.600 --> 06:21:55.270 align:start position:0%
christmas tree bill
hb2

06:21:55.270 --> 06:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
06:21:57.910 --> 06:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
it was a bill that has tried to meander
 
06:22:00.788 --> 06:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
its way through the legislative process
 
06:22:02.948 --> 06:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
one body to the other body to a
 
06:22:02.958 --> 06:22:04.150 align:start position:0%
one body to the other body to a
signature

06:22:04.150 --> 06:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
signature
 
06:22:06.788 --> 06:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
but didn't quite make it
 
06:22:09.910 --> 06:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
and sort of like the christmas tree that
 
06:22:12.830 --> 06:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
has unexpected presence under it it
 
06:22:17.110 --> 06:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
reappeared in the how in the hb2 was a
 
06:22:19.510 --> 06:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill that ultimately was passed without
 
06:22:22.070 --> 06:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
following what some argue is the typical
 
06:22:24.628 --> 06:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
06:22:27.030 --> 06:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
as stated this board is relatively new
 
06:22:29.110 --> 06:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
but i would suggest to you that waiting
 
06:22:31.750 --> 06:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
for something we create to go bad to fix
 
06:22:33.990 --> 06:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
it is not a reason to not address it
 
06:22:34.000 --> 06:22:35.670 align:start position:0%
it is not a reason to not address it
today

06:22:35.670 --> 06:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:22:37.910 --> 06:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
since the housing appeals board was
 
06:22:40.708 --> 06:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
formed there have actually been 15 at
 
06:22:41.830 --> 06:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
least at the time the committee
 
06:22:44.390 --> 06:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
considered it 15 bills that were
 
06:22:46.628 --> 06:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
considered by this which are appeals
 
06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
from your local boards and
 
06:22:53.270 --> 06:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
as also suggested it has included an
 
06:22:55.350 --> 06:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
appeal from the board of selectmen even
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
though an appeal from the board of
 
06:22:59.990 --> 06:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
selectmen was not ever listed
 
06:23:01.990 --> 06:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
in the jurisdiction of this board when
 
06:23:04.390 --> 06:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
the bill was adopted
 
06:23:06.868 --> 06:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
what was listed in the jurisdiction of
 
06:23:06.878 --> 06:23:07.910 align:start position:0%
what was listed in the jurisdiction of
bills

06:23:07.910 --> 06:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:23:10.708 --> 06:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
of for the board when this was adopted
 
06:23:11.868 --> 06:23:11.878 align:start position:0%
was a
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
non-exclusive list
 
06:23:17.110 --> 06:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
of things that do not include
 
06:23:19.430 --> 06:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
development of land
 
06:23:21.910 --> 06:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
so what it is it was authorized by
 
06:23:25.110 --> 06:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
statute to do was to hear appeals of
 
06:23:28.468 --> 06:23:28.478 align:start position:0%
fines ordinances and things that were
 
06:23:28.478 --> 06:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
fines ordinances and things that were
never

06:23:29.350 --> 06:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
never
 
06:23:31.750 --> 06:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
expressed as the purpose of the housing
 
06:23:33.270 --> 06:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
appeals board
 
06:23:35.510 --> 06:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
06:23:38.390 --> 06:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
is put the housing appeals board in a
 
06:23:42.468 --> 06:23:42.478 align:start position:0%
position where its authority is clearly
 
06:23:45.590 --> 06:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
delineated to those decisions in your
 
06:23:48.070 --> 06:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
localities that deal with the approval
 
06:23:50.150 --> 06:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
of development of land that's what it
 
06:23:52.548 --> 06:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
was intended to do and i ask that you
 
06:23:54.868 --> 06:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
approve the bill so it is what it can
 
06:23:59.430 --> 06:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:01.190 --> 06:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
motion before is the majority puerto
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%

06:25:38.708 --> 06:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
i rise to oppose the passage of house
 
06:25:40.948 --> 06:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
bill 1342.
 
06:25:42.948 --> 06:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes the people we elect to our
 
06:25:45.110 --> 06:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
governing boards get impressed
 
06:25:47.350 --> 06:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
with all the demands of government when
 
06:25:49.030 --> 06:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
most of the voices they hear
 
06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
they are listening to are all saying
 
06:25:53.350 --> 06:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
spend spend spend
 
06:25:55.590 --> 06:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
so we allowed the taxpayers to vote in
 
06:25:57.270 --> 06:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
spending caps
 
06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
a landmark decision on manchester
 
06:26:02.070 --> 06:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
spending led to the passage of a 2011
 
06:26:04.868 --> 06:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
law to put in law guidance on spending
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
caps that had been passed locally
 
06:26:09.830 --> 06:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
the law stated and i quote
 
06:26:11.990 --> 06:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
all towner city charters which have been
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
adopted revised or amended to include a
 
06:26:18.150 --> 06:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
tax or spending cap of any kind and all
 
06:26:19.590 --> 06:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
charter commissions which have been
 
06:26:21.990 --> 06:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
properly established and elected all
 
06:26:24.070 --> 06:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
elections properly held in all actions
 
06:26:26.230 --> 06:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
properly taken related to the tax of
 
06:26:28.310 --> 06:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
spending cap in set charters are hereby
 
06:26:30.788 --> 06:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
endorsed ratified validated and
 
06:26:32.788 --> 06:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
legalized and a fully enforceable
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
without regard to whether such entities
 
06:26:37.510 --> 06:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
or actions were authorized by law at the
 
06:26:40.390 --> 06:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
time they were established or taken when
 
06:26:42.708 --> 06:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
enacted some of the spending caps
 
06:26:46.150 --> 06:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
included an override clause but not all
 
06:26:47.670 --> 06:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
of them did
 
06:26:50.948 --> 06:26:50.958 align:start position:0%
so those are left without that control
 
06:26:52.708 --> 06:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
thus we see
 
06:26:55.270 --> 06:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 1342
 
06:26:57.990 --> 06:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
it was filed to benefit nashua
 
06:26:59.750 --> 06:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
because when their spending cap was
 
06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
passed there was no section to provide
 
06:27:05.430 --> 06:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
for a supermajority override
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
06:27:08.708 --> 06:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
override the nashua budget now it would
 
06:27:10.788 --> 06:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
take a charter commission
 
06:27:13.430 --> 06:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
to place the override language therein
 
06:27:15.110 --> 06:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
a charter commissioned by the legal
 
06:27:15.120 --> 06:27:16.468 align:start position:0%
a charter commissioned by the legal
procedure

06:27:16.468 --> 06:27:16.478 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
06:27:18.468 --> 06:27:18.478 align:start position:0%
takes about two years
 
06:27:20.230 --> 06:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
nashua wants their representatives to
 
06:27:22.150 --> 06:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
pass this law so they can do it in less
 
06:27:22.160 --> 06:27:23.670 align:start position:0%
pass this law so they can do it in less
time

06:27:23.670 --> 06:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:27:24.948 --> 06:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
although many of the municipal and
 
06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
county government
 
06:27:28.788 --> 06:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
committee seem to sympathize with that
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
intent this bill before us has
 
06:27:33.590 --> 06:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences as it was
 
06:27:33.600 --> 06:27:34.628 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences as it was
written

06:27:34.628 --> 06:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:27:36.708 --> 06:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
i see that it eliminates provisions in
 
06:27:38.468 --> 06:27:38.478 align:start position:0%
an earlier law that would have protected
 
06:27:40.788 --> 06:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
previous actions it eliminates some of
 
06:27:42.548 --> 06:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
the language in the paragraph i just
 
06:27:45.190 --> 06:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
read in quotation marks
 
06:27:47.110 --> 06:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
it would remove the necessity for an
 
06:27:47.120 --> 06:27:48.070 align:start position:0%
it would remove the necessity for an
annual

06:27:48.070 --> 06:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
annual
 
06:27:50.468 --> 06:27:50.478 align:start position:0%
municipal budget super majority vote in
 
06:27:52.628 --> 06:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
order to exclude interest and principle
 
06:27:55.110 --> 06:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
on municipal bonded debt or capital
 
06:27:58.070 --> 06:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
expenditure to outside the limit of the
 
06:28:00.628 --> 06:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
capped budget it would remove the
 
06:28:03.270 --> 06:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
necessity of an annual municipal budget
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
super majority vote in order for an
 
06:28:07.990 --> 06:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
ordinance or accounting practice to
 
06:28:10.230 --> 06:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
redistribute budget items from within
 
06:28:12.468 --> 06:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
the limits of the cap budget most
 
06:28:12.478 --> 06:28:13.830 align:start position:0%
the limits of the cap budget most
importantly

06:28:13.830 --> 06:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
06:28:15.750 --> 06:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would eliminate the crucial
 
06:28:18.468 --> 06:28:18.478 align:start position:0%
provisions signed into law just last
 
06:28:18.478 --> 06:28:19.750 align:start position:0%
provisions signed into law just last
year

06:28:19.750 --> 06:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:28:21.830 --> 06:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
that grandfather tax and spending caps
 
06:28:25.590 --> 06:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
enacted before july 5th 2011
 
06:28:26.868 --> 06:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
that would be eliminated thus
 
06:28:29.590 --> 06:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing municipal charter tax and
 
06:28:32.868 --> 06:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
spending caps across the state
 
06:28:35.110 --> 06:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
could affect your municipal budget while
 
06:28:40.310 --> 06:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
narrowly focusing on nashua's problem to
 
06:28:43.030 --> 06:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
fix one problem we should not jeopardize
 
06:28:45.350 --> 06:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
the situation of perhaps many other
 
06:28:48.310 --> 06:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
places this bill has flaws rather than
 
06:28:50.390 --> 06:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
having to come back next time to fix
 
06:28:53.350 --> 06:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
them let's just reverse this octopass
 
06:28:55.430 --> 06:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
and make the bill inexpedient to
 
06:28:55.440 --> 06:28:57.030 align:start position:0%
and make the bill inexpedient to
legislate

06:28:57.030 --> 06:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
06:29:01.590 --> 06:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
press the red button thank you
 
06:29:03.270 --> 06:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
chair representatives representative
 
06:29:08.230 --> 06:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:10.628 --> 06:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker happy st patrick's
 
06:29:14.310 --> 06:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
day to you and to all my colleagues
 
06:29:17.030 --> 06:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
what's before us this afternoon is house
 
06:29:18.990 --> 06:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
bill 13
 
06:29:19.000 --> 06:29:20.628 align:start position:0%
bill 13
1342

06:29:20.628 --> 06:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
1342
 
06:29:23.430 --> 06:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
and it is kind of in an indirect way a
 
06:29:27.110 --> 06:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
rebuttal to senate bill 52
 
06:29:30.390 --> 06:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
if the representative if i listen to his
 
06:29:30.400 --> 06:29:31.430 align:start position:0%
if the representative if i listen to his
debate

06:29:31.430 --> 06:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
debate
 
06:29:35.190 --> 06:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
and he says well how things came in well
 
06:29:38.468 --> 06:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
senate bill 52 instead of taking the
 
06:29:40.390 --> 06:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
freight elevator it definitely took the
 
06:29:42.548 --> 06:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
express elevator
 
06:29:45.190 --> 06:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay the right way to have done this
 
06:29:48.310 --> 06:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
was to have something brought up as on a
 
06:29:51.510 --> 06:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
referendum within the city budget as
 
06:29:54.548 --> 06:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
a city ballot but that wasn't done
 
06:29:57.590 --> 06:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
instead it came in via a back door
 
06:29:59.030 --> 06:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
with a senator
 
06:30:01.510 --> 06:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
and thus here we are so whenever
 
06:30:04.390 --> 06:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
anything comes in the back door
 
06:30:06.468 --> 06:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
does it really
 
06:30:09.030 --> 06:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
solve a hundred percent of the problem
 
06:30:11.430 --> 06:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
the answer is usually not
 
06:30:14.868 --> 06:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
okay so in this particular case
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
nashua yes is seek and resolve now i
 
06:30:20.070 --> 06:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
understand that i don't want you some of
 
06:30:21.990 --> 06:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
my good friends and colleagues to be
 
06:30:24.548 --> 06:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
rolling your eyes sort of like an old
 
06:30:26.788 --> 06:30:26.798 align:start position:0%
episode of the brady bunch where jan
 
06:30:30.628 --> 06:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
goes up and says masha marsha maja
 
06:30:32.548 --> 06:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
and here's obi down at the well going
 
06:30:36.868 --> 06:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:40.788 --> 06:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
but this is a truly legitimate problem
 
06:30:43.750 --> 06:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of nashua
 
06:30:47.030 --> 06:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
what's at hand here if there is some
 
06:30:49.510 --> 06:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
dire emergency
 
06:30:52.468 --> 06:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
nashville may need a mechanism
 
06:30:54.468 --> 06:30:54.478 align:start position:0%
to override
 
06:30:57.430 --> 06:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
the cap on the particular issue
 
06:30:59.670 --> 06:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
so i arise today to urge you
 
06:31:01.910 --> 06:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i would also like to say in our
 
06:31:03.670 --> 06:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
existing charter
 
06:31:07.030 --> 06:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
there is all it is already codified
 
06:31:09.910 --> 06:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we do have a super majority it's in
 
06:31:11.670 --> 06:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
the chatter
 
06:31:13.990 --> 06:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
so i rise today to urge you to support
 
06:31:16.868 --> 06:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
1342 with a positive recommendation of
 
06:31:18.788 --> 06:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
what to pass
 
06:31:20.788 --> 06:31:20.798 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow the citizens of
 
06:31:23.510 --> 06:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
nashua the same fiscal rights
 
06:31:26.708 --> 06:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
enjoyed by many of your same communities
 
06:31:29.190 --> 06:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
if you have in your community a spending
 
06:31:32.310 --> 06:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
cap you probably do have some overripe
 
06:31:36.150 --> 06:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
vision in it all nashville wants to do
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
in this particular bill is to be treated
 
06:31:38.878 --> 06:31:41.190 align:start position:0%
in this particular bill is to be treated
fairly

06:31:41.190 --> 06:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
06:31:42.548 --> 06:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
you remember
 
06:31:45.350 --> 06:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
i previously came last year and came
 
06:31:48.150 --> 06:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
before you on senate bill 52 which was
 
06:31:50.468 --> 06:31:50.478 align:start position:0%
discussed by this body at that time i
 
06:31:54.628 --> 06:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
spoke 52 was flawed and created problems
 
06:31:57.750 --> 06:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
again as i reiterated earlier
 
06:32:00.468 --> 06:32:00.478 align:start position:0%
having this without an override is one
 
06:32:04.468 --> 06:32:04.478 align:start position:0%
of the problems this does not harm
 
06:32:06.468 --> 06:32:06.478 align:start position:0%
senate bill 52
 
06:32:10.070 --> 06:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact it enhances it
 
06:32:12.390 --> 06:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
by enhancing it
 
06:32:14.948 --> 06:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
it will basically allow the override
 
06:32:17.270 --> 06:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
position now how did we get here from
 
06:32:17.280 --> 06:32:18.310 align:start position:0%
position now how did we get here from
nashua

06:32:18.310 --> 06:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
06:32:20.310 --> 06:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
this was tried and true the supreme
 
06:32:23.030 --> 06:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
court ruled down the spending cap till
 
06:32:26.468 --> 06:32:26.478 align:start position:0%
we can have the override position put
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
into it
 
06:32:30.628 --> 06:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
why is this override provision needed
 
06:32:32.548 --> 06:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
well many of you will there wear two
 
06:32:35.510 --> 06:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
hats like i do i'm uh alderman in the
 
06:32:37.910 --> 06:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
city now sure and maybe some of you
 
06:32:39.910 --> 06:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
besides being the same rep are in the
 
06:32:41.670 --> 06:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
same boat
 
06:32:43.990 --> 06:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know that sometimes murphy is
 
06:32:46.390 --> 06:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
speaking the same patty say murphy's law
 
06:32:48.628 --> 06:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
what can go wrong will
 
06:32:50.548 --> 06:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
maybe a wall might fall on your fire
 
06:32:52.868 --> 06:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
truck or something might happen and at
 
06:32:55.510 --> 06:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
times you may need a remedy to go above
 
06:32:56.628 --> 06:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
06:33:00.070 --> 06:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
so by allowing nashua to have this
 
06:33:02.070 --> 06:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
will allow them to address those
 
06:33:04.708 --> 06:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
particular issues
 
06:33:08.390 --> 06:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
in essence senate house bill 1342 does
 
06:33:10.948 --> 06:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
not in any form like they say try to
 
06:33:14.788 --> 06:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
harm senate bill 52.
 
06:33:16.628 --> 06:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
06:33:19.190 --> 06:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
there is further president on this and i
 
06:33:21.990 --> 06:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
want to bring up that rsa49c
 
06:33:24.310 --> 06:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
semicolon 33
 
06:33:27.670 --> 06:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
the letter i parentheses d
 
06:33:29.590 --> 06:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to bore you
 
06:33:31.830 --> 06:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
but i'll limit all the annual spending
 
06:33:33.670 --> 06:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
increases that increases the amount
 
06:33:36.150 --> 06:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
raised by taxes under the city budget
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
adopted pursuant to rsa 49 dash 49-c 23
 
06:33:45.030 --> 06:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
such a cap shall provide for an override
 
06:33:48.310 --> 06:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
threshold on a vote to exceed the normal
 
06:33:50.788 --> 06:33:50.798 align:start position:0%
annual increase which shall be a
 
06:33:53.350 --> 06:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
supermajority as determined by the
 
06:33:56.788 --> 06:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
charter a tax cap in the provision of a
 
06:33:59.590 --> 06:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
city charter may provide for
 
06:34:01.990 --> 06:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
specific conclusions do i don't think
 
06:34:03.590 --> 06:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
you want me to go on with the whole
 
06:34:03.600 --> 06:34:04.628 align:start position:0%
you want me to go on with the whole
thing

06:34:04.628 --> 06:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:34:07.110 --> 06:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
but i think you can believe me on
 
06:34:09.270 --> 06:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what i say it's right in the
 
06:34:11.270 --> 06:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
near the rsa
 
06:34:13.750 --> 06:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking you
 
06:34:16.868 --> 06:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit friendly nashua has a
 
06:34:18.468 --> 06:34:18.478 align:start position:0%
little bit of an issue i know it's the
 
06:34:18.478 --> 06:34:19.590 align:start position:0%
little bit of an issue i know it's the
only

06:34:19.590 --> 06:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
only
 
06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
we're the only city or town that has
 
06:34:25.110 --> 06:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
this particular issue
 
06:34:27.910 --> 06:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking for your grace
 
06:34:29.830 --> 06:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
that you will come up and support the
 
06:34:32.310 --> 06:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
citizens of nashua and
 
06:34:32.320 --> 06:34:33.670 align:start position:0%
citizens of nashua and
by

06:34:33.670 --> 06:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:34:37.190 --> 06:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
passing house bill 1342
 
06:34:39.350 --> 06:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
and to allow the right that evidently
 
06:34:41.750 --> 06:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
was wrong to allow the city of nashville
 
06:34:43.990 --> 06:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
which was a stand-alone municipality
 
06:34:46.468 --> 06:34:46.478 align:start position:0%
with no override provision
 
06:34:48.708 --> 06:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
and to become part of it just like
 
06:34:50.868 --> 06:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
manchester which is similar in size to
 
06:34:50.878 --> 06:34:51.750 align:start position:0%
manchester which is similar in size to
us

06:34:51.750 --> 06:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:34:54.150 --> 06:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
and they have the override as well
 
06:34:56.708 --> 06:34:56.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking for fair treatment thank
 
06:35:00.868 --> 06:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:02.708 --> 06:35:02.718 align:start position:0%

municipal and county governments which
 
06:45:08.310 --> 06:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
was referred house bill 1667 an act
 
06:45:10.230 --> 06:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
relative to the standard and optional
 
06:45:11.910 --> 06:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits
 
06:45:13.030 --> 06:45:13.040 align:start position:0%

06:45:14.948 --> 06:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
all veterans tax credit having

considered the same report the same with
 
06:45:18.070 --> 06:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the bill ought
 
06:45:20.230 --> 06:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
to pass representative diane power for
 
06:45:21.990 --> 06:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee
 
06:45:23.270 --> 06:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee having
 
06:45:24.948 --> 06:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
considered the same and being unable to
 
06:45:26.548 --> 06:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
06:45:28.468 --> 06:45:28.478 align:start position:0%
following resolution resolved that it is
 
06:45:30.948 --> 06:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate representative
 
06:45:32.708 --> 06:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
patricia cleave for the minority of the
 
06:45:34.948 --> 06:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
committee the member from nashua
 
06:45:36.310 --> 06:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative clee is recognized to
 
06:45:42.628 --> 06:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:44.708 --> 06:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:45:47.190 --> 06:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues i have to admit as a person
 
06:45:49.990 --> 06:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
who's worked with the military veterans
 
06:45:52.310 --> 06:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
since i was 18 years old who's worked
 
06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
with department of defense department of
 
06:45:56.548 --> 06:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
veterans affairs
 
06:45:58.390 --> 06:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
for me to speak against anything that
 
06:46:01.110 --> 06:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
would limit any person from a military
 
06:46:03.030 --> 06:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
background veteran or active duty
 
06:46:05.110 --> 06:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
getting any extra benefit puts a dagger
 
06:46:06.868 --> 06:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
into my heart
 
06:46:08.628 --> 06:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
but the truth is we have to look at the
 
06:46:10.230 --> 06:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
big picture
 
06:46:12.150 --> 06:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
and we have to be honest that in the end
 
06:46:15.750 --> 06:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is a tax shifting bill
 
06:46:17.670 --> 06:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
it shifts the tax burden from one group
 
06:46:19.590 --> 06:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
of individuals to another group of
 
06:46:19.600 --> 06:46:20.868 align:start position:0%
of individuals to another group of
individuals

06:46:20.868 --> 06:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
06:46:23.350 --> 06:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
the broadened definition will only add
 
06:46:25.430 --> 06:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
more to the pool who qualify for the
 
06:46:27.670 --> 06:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
veterans credits and exemptions
 
06:46:29.750 --> 06:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
i agree we should do everything that we
 
06:46:29.760 --> 06:46:30.390 align:start position:0%
i agree we should do everything that we
can

06:46:30.390 --> 06:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:46:32.468 --> 06:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
to take to thank those
 
06:46:34.788 --> 06:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
that have and are serving our country in
 
06:46:36.948 --> 06:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
keeping us safe but doing so at the
 
06:46:39.270 --> 06:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
expense of others doesn't make us the
 
06:46:40.548 --> 06:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
good guys
 
06:46:42.868 --> 06:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
while serving on state federal relations
 
06:46:44.390 --> 06:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
and veterans affairs there were a number
 
06:46:46.230 --> 06:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
of bills brought to create equity
 
06:46:49.990 --> 06:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
between title 38 veterans benefits u.s
 
06:46:52.390 --> 06:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
code 101 definitions
 
06:46:55.510 --> 06:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
often referred to as usc 101
 
06:46:57.350 --> 06:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
meaning the definitions
 
06:46:59.510 --> 06:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
of veterans and what is a veteran as
 
06:47:02.868 --> 06:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
well as what is active duty as per usc
 
06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
101 a veteran by definition is a person
 
06:47:07.910 --> 06:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
who served
 
06:47:10.948 --> 06:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
in the active military naval or air
 
06:47:13.110 --> 06:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
service and who was discharged or
 
06:47:14.868 --> 06:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
released there from
 
06:47:18.230 --> 06:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
under conditions other than dishonorable
 
06:47:21.590 --> 06:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
the key word here is served not serving
 
06:47:24.390 --> 06:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
as i already stated but bears repeating
 
06:47:27.350 --> 06:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
if we were to change the definition
 
06:47:28.628 --> 06:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of credits and
 
06:47:30.708 --> 06:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
exemptions we are adding to the pool of
 
06:47:32.548 --> 06:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
those who qualify for these credits and
 
06:47:32.558 --> 06:47:33.670 align:start position:0%
those who qualify for these credits and
exemptions

06:47:33.670 --> 06:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
06:47:36.390 --> 06:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
in 2020 based on the department of
 
06:47:36.400 --> 06:47:37.430 align:start position:0%
in 2020 based on the department of
revenue

06:47:37.430 --> 06:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
06:47:39.350 --> 06:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
06:47:41.590 --> 06:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
reports the the state of new hampshire
 
06:47:44.788 --> 06:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
through the municipalities granted 31
 
06:47:44.798 --> 06:47:45.830 align:start position:0%
through the municipalities granted 31
million

06:47:45.830 --> 06:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
06:47:48.150 --> 06:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
seven hundred and seventy five thousand
 
06:47:50.230 --> 06:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
six hundred and thirty seven
 
06:47:52.310 --> 06:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
dollars in tax relief
 
06:47:56.230 --> 06:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
to fifty four thousand 654
 
06:47:58.868 --> 06:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
veterans and or families
 
06:48:00.310 --> 06:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell
 
06:48:01.910 --> 06:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
those who do not qualify for these
 
06:48:04.868 --> 06:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
exemptions and credits share in what is
 
06:48:07.990 --> 06:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
often referred to as lost taxes
 
06:48:10.390 --> 06:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
meaning their taxes go up to cover these
 
06:48:12.150 --> 06:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
lost taxes
 
06:48:14.070 --> 06:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the veterans tax
 
06:48:16.948 --> 06:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
credit exemption program is enabling
 
06:48:19.350 --> 06:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
and will remain that way even if this
 
06:48:21.030 --> 06:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
passes but
 
06:48:22.868 --> 06:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
and this is a big but
 
06:48:25.030 --> 06:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
when each municipality designed their
 
06:48:28.150 --> 06:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
program they based it on what they felt
 
06:48:31.030 --> 06:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
their residents could or would bear
 
06:48:33.270 --> 06:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
summoners chose not to grant any
 
06:48:35.750 --> 06:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
veterans credits exemptions and others
 
06:48:36.948 --> 06:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
have given
 
06:48:38.948 --> 06:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
high amounts and others not quite so
 
06:48:38.958 --> 06:48:40.230 align:start position:0%
high amounts and others not quite so
much

06:48:40.230 --> 06:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:48:42.150 --> 06:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
i stated that in 2020 in the state of
 
06:48:43.670 --> 06:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipalities granted
 
06:48:47.110 --> 06:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
almost 32 million in tax relief just to
 
06:48:49.270 --> 06:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
veterans and their families
 
06:48:51.270 --> 06:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
these are small communities i'm sorry
 
06:48:53.030 --> 06:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
there are small communities who don't
 
06:48:54.390 --> 06:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
grant any
 
06:48:55.910 --> 06:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
and some that grant as little as an
 
06:48:58.468 --> 06:48:58.478 align:start position:0%
overall amount of only fifty dollars and
 
06:49:00.628 --> 06:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
then there are those larger communities
 
06:49:02.548 --> 06:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
cited in the minority report they
 
06:49:05.510 --> 06:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
granted credits exemptions in excess of
 
06:49:07.910 --> 06:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars
 
06:49:09.910 --> 06:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
communities such as those in the area of
 
06:49:12.390 --> 06:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
peace and those communities that border
 
06:49:12.400 --> 06:49:13.350 align:start position:0%
peace and those communities that border
the

06:49:13.350 --> 06:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:49:15.910 --> 06:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
state to our south will have the largest
 
06:49:15.920 --> 06:49:17.430 align:start position:0%
state to our south will have the largest
impact

06:49:17.430 --> 06:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
impact
 
06:49:19.990 --> 06:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
based on 2020 figures of active duty and
 
06:49:21.670 --> 06:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
reservists here in new hampshire there's
 
06:49:23.910 --> 06:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
potential increase of the pool by an
 
06:49:27.030 --> 06:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
additional 10 percent who will qualify
 
06:49:29.030 --> 06:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
again shifting the burden to other
 
06:49:32.150 --> 06:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
property owners who do not qualify
 
06:49:33.430 --> 06:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the end
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
isn't a new tax shift of any form an
 
06:49:38.390 --> 06:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
increase in taxes
 
06:49:40.548 --> 06:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
and isn't the state of new hampshire all
 
06:49:42.708 --> 06:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
about little to no taxes
 
06:49:44.390 --> 06:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to throw around the cliche
 
06:49:46.948 --> 06:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
that is often spoken in this chamber
 
06:49:49.270 --> 06:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
relative to taxes but i know that i
 
06:49:51.830 --> 06:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
can't ask those already struggling in my
 
06:49:54.788 --> 06:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
city to pick up an additional burden can
 
06:49:54.798 --> 06:49:56.150 align:start position:0%
city to pick up an additional burden can
you

06:49:56.150 --> 06:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:49:57.750 --> 06:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
the only way to eliminate that burden
 
06:49:59.590 --> 06:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
would be to either one
 
06:50:01.830 --> 06:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
lessen the amount granted for a credit
 
06:50:04.150 --> 06:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
or two completely the eliminate the
 
06:50:06.628 --> 06:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
credit exemption in that community
 
06:50:08.390 --> 06:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
personally i don't see the latter
 
06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
happening but i do believe it's
 
06:50:12.468 --> 06:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
conceivable for larger communities to
 
06:50:14.948 --> 06:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
reduce what they currently grant
 
06:50:17.270 --> 06:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
if that happens once again we are
 
06:50:18.868 --> 06:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
increasing the tax burden of those
 
06:50:18.878 --> 06:50:20.070 align:start position:0%
increasing the tax burden of those
veterans

06:50:20.070 --> 06:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
06:50:21.990 --> 06:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
who are getting the credit slash
 
06:50:22.000 --> 06:50:23.350 align:start position:0%
who are getting the credit slash
exemptions

06:50:23.350 --> 06:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
06:50:26.310 --> 06:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
this is a very hard catch 22 in that
 
06:50:28.310 --> 06:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation will hurt one
 
06:50:31.590 --> 06:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
group or another or multiple groups
 
06:50:33.750 --> 06:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is not a political fight
 
06:50:35.910 --> 06:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
rather it's a fight to not burden those
 
06:50:38.628 --> 06:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
already held down by taxes just to say
 
06:50:39.750 --> 06:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
look how
 
06:50:43.510 --> 06:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
we helped one very important population
 
06:50:45.030 --> 06:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
i have to ask
 
06:50:46.548 --> 06:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
can we do so on the backs of the
 
06:50:48.468 --> 06:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
remaining property owners
 
06:50:50.070 --> 06:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
again i'm going to repeat something to
 
06:50:51.830 --> 06:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
help make it clear so that we all
 
06:50:53.830 --> 06:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
understand the situation you'll hear
 
06:50:55.990 --> 06:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
from others that veterans tax credit is
 
06:50:58.788 --> 06:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
enabling and yes it is
 
06:50:58.798 --> 06:51:00.310 align:start position:0%
enabling and yes it is
however

06:51:00.310 --> 06:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:51:02.708 --> 06:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
if you implement it or have done so you
 
06:51:05.990 --> 06:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
must do so in its entirety
 
06:51:08.070 --> 06:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
you can't say this group or that group
 
06:51:10.390 --> 06:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
you have to do it all exactly as the
 
06:51:11.910 --> 06:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislation says
 
06:51:13.910 --> 06:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
you can set the amount that you give as
 
06:51:15.910 --> 06:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
long as you stay within the minimum and
 
06:51:18.230 --> 06:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
maximum set by this very body
 
06:51:20.548 --> 06:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
this means that some municipalities have
 
06:51:23.110 --> 06:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits exemptions while
 
06:51:25.270 --> 06:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
others have a credit as low as the
 
06:51:27.750 --> 06:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
minimum of fifty dollars and others as
 
06:51:29.430 --> 06:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
high as the maximum of seven hundred and
 
06:51:30.708 --> 06:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars
 
06:51:32.310 --> 06:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
some may say this doesn't cost the state
 
06:51:34.708 --> 06:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
or the municipality a single dime
 
06:51:36.868 --> 06:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
they're one hundred percent right it
 
06:51:39.590 --> 06:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a toll on either budget
 
06:51:39.600 --> 06:51:40.628 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a toll on either budget
however

06:51:40.628 --> 06:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:51:43.750 --> 06:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
it does hit the wallets of those
 
06:51:45.910 --> 06:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
who this does not apply to
 
06:51:47.670 --> 06:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
as my mom taught me
 
06:51:49.910 --> 06:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
stealing from peter to pay paul and
 
06:51:51.430 --> 06:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
patting ourselves on the back because we
 
06:51:53.750 --> 06:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
helped veterans doesn't make us better
 
06:51:53.760 --> 06:51:54.628 align:start position:0%
helped veterans doesn't make us better
people

06:51:54.628 --> 06:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:51:56.150 --> 06:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
let's continue to use the definition
 
06:52:00.310 --> 06:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
provided by title 38 usc 101 relative to
 
06:52:02.548 --> 06:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
veterans as those who have served and
 
06:52:04.948 --> 06:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
not broadened the definition here
 
06:52:06.708 --> 06:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
those that argue in favor of this bill
 
06:52:09.030 --> 06:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
may say this is just a housekeeping bill
 
06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
to bring one state statute into the
 
06:52:13.750 --> 06:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
other in line with another
 
06:52:15.430 --> 06:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
while there may be another new hampshire
 
06:52:16.948 --> 06:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
statute that defines a veteran to
 
06:52:20.310 --> 06:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
include active duty etc perhaps we need
 
06:52:21.830 --> 06:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
to examine why
 
06:52:24.468 --> 06:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
and if necessary bring that statute into
 
06:52:24.478 --> 06:52:25.590 align:start position:0%
and if necessary bring that statute into
alignment

06:52:25.590 --> 06:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
alignment
 
06:52:28.708 --> 06:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
and the veterans benefit title 38 usc
 
06:52:30.868 --> 06:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
101's definition of a veteran as a
 
06:52:32.468 --> 06:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
person who served
 
06:52:35.350 --> 06:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
and not serving remember unintended
 
06:52:37.350 --> 06:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
consequences a broader definition for a
 
06:52:39.190 --> 06:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
veteran that puts us in conflict with
 
06:52:41.510 --> 06:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
the federal definition of a veteran only
 
06:52:43.910 --> 06:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
puts a burden on those pools of property
 
06:52:46.390 --> 06:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
owners who don't qualify
 
06:52:48.310 --> 06:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
this body does everything that we can to
 
06:52:51.350 --> 06:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
keep taxes low and we do that do what we
 
06:52:53.430 --> 06:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
can to maintain equity throughout our
 
06:52:53.440 --> 06:52:54.390 align:start position:0%
can to maintain equity throughout our
state

06:52:54.390 --> 06:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:52:56.868 --> 06:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
this is a simple tax shift to those who
 
06:52:58.230 --> 06:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
don't qualify
 
06:53:00.948 --> 06:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will join me in over
 
06:53:03.270 --> 06:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
overturning the odd pass of this tax
 
06:53:05.350 --> 06:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
shifting bill so that another motion can
 
06:53:07.350 --> 06:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
be made and thank you so much for
 
06:53:14.830 --> 06:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:16.948 --> 06:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
speech the member from brookline
 
06:53:19.190 --> 06:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative power is recognized to
 
06:53:27.270 --> 06:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:29.110 --> 06:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:53:31.670 --> 06:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i rise in support of the
 
06:53:33.430 --> 06:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation of ought to
 
06:53:36.948 --> 06:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
pass on house bill 1667.
 
06:53:40.948 --> 06:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
in 1871 after the civil civil war the
 
06:53:43.270 --> 06:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
first veterans tax credit was signed
 
06:53:45.590 --> 06:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
into law in new hampshire
 
06:53:48.948 --> 06:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
over the past 150 years a number of
 
06:53:51.270 --> 06:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
statutory changes have been made to
 
06:53:54.628 --> 06:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
include the latest armed conflicts
 
06:53:57.110 --> 06:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
the definition of a veteran
 
06:54:00.468 --> 06:54:00.478 align:start position:0%
and to include certain certain national
 
06:54:03.510 --> 06:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
guardsmen and reservists
 
06:54:06.070 --> 06:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law clearly defines a
 
06:54:09.190 --> 06:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
veteran as any person who has served in
 
06:54:11.910 --> 06:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
the armed forces for more than four
 
06:54:13.590 --> 06:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
years and
 
06:54:16.070 --> 06:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
continues to serve or
 
06:54:18.708 --> 06:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
who has been honorably discharged or has
 
06:54:21.910 --> 06:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
received an uncharacterized discharge
 
06:54:24.708 --> 06:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
based on a service-connected injury
 
06:54:27.590 --> 06:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
illness or disability
 
06:54:29.910 --> 06:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
due to the discrepancy between this
 
06:54:33.830 --> 06:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
definition of a veteran and the veterans
 
06:54:35.990 --> 06:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
tax credit statutes
 
06:54:38.948 --> 06:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
some military veterans are wrongly
 
06:54:42.150 --> 06:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
excluded from receiving any of the
 
06:54:44.150 --> 06:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits
 
06:54:47.750 --> 06:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
and ironically the all veterans tax
 
06:54:51.190 --> 06:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
credit does not include all veterans
 
06:54:54.468 --> 06:54:54.478 align:start position:0%
recognized under new hampshire law
 
06:54:57.030 --> 06:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1667
 
06:54:59.830 --> 06:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
addresses these inconsistencies
 
06:55:02.548 --> 06:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
first this bill amends the language in
 
06:55:04.868 --> 06:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
the veterans tax credit
 
06:55:08.230 --> 06:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
statutes to include those veterans still
 
06:55:11.750 --> 06:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
serving consistent with the statutory
 
06:55:13.990 --> 06:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
definition of a veteran
 
06:55:15.350 --> 06:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
and second
 
06:55:19.270 --> 06:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
this bill removes the title 10 prefix
 
06:55:22.868 --> 06:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
from the veterans tax credits language
 
06:55:24.868 --> 06:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
so that title 10
 
06:55:29.350 --> 06:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
title 32 and title 14 active service
 
06:55:33.270 --> 06:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
all qualify for the 90-day requirement
 
06:55:33.280 --> 06:55:34.468 align:start position:0%
all qualify for the 90-day requirement
lastly

06:55:34.468 --> 06:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
06:55:36.390 --> 06:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
it is important to note
 
06:55:39.350 --> 06:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
that less than half a percent
 
06:55:42.230 --> 06:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
of americans currently serve in our
 
06:55:44.070 --> 06:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
armed forces
 
06:55:44.080 --> 06:55:45.270 align:start position:0%
armed forces
therefore

06:55:45.270 --> 06:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
06:55:47.590 --> 06:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
the claim that these changes will create
 
06:55:51.990 --> 06:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
an undue tax burden is over exaggerated
 
06:55:53.430 --> 06:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
and furthermore
 
06:55:55.590 --> 06:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount that my colleague
 
06:55:55.600 --> 06:55:57.270 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount that my colleague
quoted

06:55:57.270 --> 06:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
quoted
 
06:56:00.868 --> 06:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:00.878 --> 06:56:02.548 align:start position:0%
 
pertains

06:56:02.548 --> 06:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
pertains
 
06:56:07.270 --> 06:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
a large percentage to disabled veterans
 
06:56:09.030 --> 06:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
06:56:11.990 --> 06:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
this bill clarifies that all veterans of

mr speaker if i know that the expanded

definition of a veteran proposed in this
 
06:59:18.718 --> 06:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
definition of a veteran proposed in this
bill

06:59:19.750 --> 06:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:59:21.430 --> 06:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the definition of
 
06:59:24.150 --> 06:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
veterans under federal law
 
06:59:26.070 --> 06:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
and if i know that new hampshire towns
 
06:59:28.230 --> 06:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
and cities already provide generous
 
06:59:31.270 --> 06:59:31.280 align:start position:0%

2020 alone
 
06:59:39.350 --> 06:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
06:59:41.990 --> 06:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill will shift tax burdens
 
06:59:44.390 --> 06:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
from one group to another
 
06:59:47.110 --> 06:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
something we really don't want to do
 
06:59:49.670 --> 06:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
resulting in significant property tax
 
06:59:52.468 --> 06:59:52.478 align:start position:0%
increases for those who do not qualify
 
06:59:55.030 --> 06:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button to
 
06:59:56.948 --> 06:59:56.958 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr speaker um

if if i know from my 33 years of serving
 
07:00:17.350 --> 07:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
in all components of the army
 
07:00:17.360 --> 07:00:19.030 align:start position:0%
in all components of the army
that

07:00:19.030 --> 07:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:00:21.430 --> 07:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
my 10 years of active duty
 
07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
was spent on hardship tours
 
07:00:28.868 --> 07:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
in monterey california san antonio texas
 
07:00:32.468 --> 07:00:32.478 align:start position:0%
the university of southern california
 
07:00:34.548 --> 07:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
and seoul korea
 
07:00:34.558 --> 07:00:35.510 align:start position:0%
and seoul korea
but

07:00:35.510 --> 07:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:00:37.830 --> 07:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
that my two tours
 
07:00:40.390 --> 07:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
of being called recalled to active duty
 
07:00:43.030 --> 07:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
as a guardsman or a res or a reservist i
 
07:00:46.548 --> 07:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:49.830 --> 07:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
i deployed to afghanistan
 
07:00:53.430 --> 07:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
and got shot at four times i never got
 
07:00:55.750 --> 07:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
shot at on active duty
 
07:01:00.390 --> 07:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
and so as we look dispassionately
 
07:01:01.590 --> 07:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
that as we look dispassionately at these
 
07:01:03.840 --> 07:01:05.830 align:start position:0%
that as we look dispassionately at these
definitions

07:01:05.830 --> 07:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
07:01:08.788 --> 07:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
the way the current
 
07:01:11.110 --> 07:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
tax code is written
 
07:01:14.468 --> 07:01:14.478 align:start position:0%
discriminates against the guardsmen and
 
07:01:16.230 --> 07:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
the reservists
 
07:01:16.240 --> 07:01:17.350 align:start position:0%
the reservists
who

07:01:17.350 --> 07:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
who
 
07:01:20.788 --> 07:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
after 20 years of a land war
 
07:01:22.548 --> 07:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
in the middle east
 
07:01:25.990 --> 07:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
have probably seen as much combat duty
 
07:01:28.948 --> 07:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
as most active duty people
 
07:01:30.628 --> 07:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
so if i knew
 
07:01:32.708 --> 07:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
that this wasn't about money because if
 
07:01:34.948 --> 07:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
it's about money we can reduce the money
 
07:01:34.958 --> 07:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
it's about money we can reduce the money
later

07:01:35.990 --> 07:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
later
 
07:01:38.230 --> 07:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
if this is if i knew that this was about
 
07:01:38.240 --> 07:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
if this is if i knew that this was about
equity

07:01:39.990 --> 07:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
equity
 
07:01:41.430 --> 07:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't i
 
07:01:44.468 --> 07:01:44.478 align:start position:0%
treat our guardsmen and our reservists
 
07:01:47.110 --> 07:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:50.150 --> 07:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
sacrificed by deploying away from their
 
07:01:50.160 --> 07:01:51.670 align:start position:0%
sacrificed by deploying away from their
families

07:01:51.670 --> 07:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
families
 
07:01:54.468 --> 07:01:54.478 align:start position:0%
only to be subjected to the same death
 
07:01:56.628 --> 07:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
and injury that an active duty soldier
 
07:01:56.638 --> 07:01:57.590 align:start position:0%
and injury that an active duty soldier
would

07:01:57.590 --> 07:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
07:01:59.750 --> 07:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if i knew all of that wouldn't i
 
07:02:05.670 --> 07:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:09.270 --> 07:02:09.280 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
07:12:44.070 --> 07:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the committee
 
07:12:45.910 --> 07:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
members who support and expedient to
 
07:12:48.868 --> 07:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
legislate believe this bill is premature
 
07:12:50.390 --> 07:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the new hampshire
 
07:12:53.030 --> 07:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
d.o.t was authorized to conduct a
 
07:12:54.708 --> 07:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
project development phase for the
 
07:12:56.468 --> 07:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
proposed capital corridor under the

state's 10-year transportation plan

entirely paid for with federal
 
07:13:03.190 --> 07:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
transportation funds no state money and
 
07:13:05.030 --> 07:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes could potentially
 
07:13:07.990 --> 07:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
leave us on the hook for an unknown sum
 
07:13:10.468 --> 07:13:10.478 align:start position:0%
and if i know that when completed next
 
07:13:12.708 --> 07:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
year the project development will give
 
07:13:15.270 --> 07:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature a clearer picture of the
 
07:13:17.270 --> 07:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
total costs and the legislatures
 
07:13:19.990 --> 07:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislators in the next term can debate
 
07:13:22.708 --> 07:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
those costs on and where the funding
 
07:13:25.590 --> 07:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
should or should not come from
 
07:13:27.670 --> 07:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that manchester is
 
07:13:29.430 --> 07:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
the economic driver of the state and
 
07:13:31.030 --> 07:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
that this project will come right
 
07:13:32.868 --> 07:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
through my district of manchester's ward
 
07:13:35.430 --> 07:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
9 bringing with it the opportunities of
 
07:13:37.830 --> 07:13:37.840 align:start position:0%

speaker mr speaker if i've learned
 
07:14:00.070 --> 07:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
anything of the two decades up here that
 
07:14:02.150 --> 07:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's nice to listen to the
 
07:14:04.628 --> 07:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
opposition before you vote against their
 
07:14:04.638 --> 07:14:05.910 align:start position:0%
opposition before you vote against their
position

position
and

07:14:06.868 --> 07:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:08.868 --> 07:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
if i know that the debate on this bill
 
07:14:11.350 --> 07:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
will be one-on-one and very short
 
07:14:13.750 --> 07:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
and that you should listen to both sides
 
07:14:16.310 --> 07:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
since it is without recommendation and
 
07:14:18.310 --> 07:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
if i truly believe that the ought to
 
07:14:21.670 --> 07:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
pass position will prevail in this body
 
07:14:24.070 --> 07:14:24.080 align:start position:0%

phase that was funded in 2019 by sb 241
 
07:16:51.190 --> 07:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
an identical language in that year's
 
07:16:52.948 --> 07:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
budget hb4
 
07:16:54.788 --> 07:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
this phase does enough engineering to
 
07:16:57.030 --> 07:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
determine a firm project cost
 
07:16:59.190 --> 07:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
completes environmental permitting and
 
07:17:01.270 --> 07:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
produces a financial plan
 
07:17:03.190 --> 07:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
to suggest how capital and operating
 
07:17:04.868 --> 07:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
costs could be covered
 
07:17:06.788 --> 07:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
it is on track to be completed later
 
07:17:07.990 --> 07:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
this year
 
07:17:09.910 --> 07:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
the source of funds is federal transit
 
07:17:12.230 --> 07:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
administration funds already in the
 
07:17:13.990 --> 07:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
state's possession matched with toll
 
07:17:16.150 --> 07:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
credits it is important to note this
 
07:17:17.990 --> 07:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
pool of money can only be spent on
 
07:17:20.788 --> 07:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
transit and only in the boston urbanized
 
07:17:23.350 --> 07:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
area the state receives a new allocation
 
07:17:25.990 --> 07:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
every year and using this funding is not
 
07:17:28.070 --> 07:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
starving any other project
 
07:17:30.230 --> 07:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
with these two steps complete a future
 
07:17:32.868 --> 07:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
legislature could decide to apply for a
 
07:17:35.190 --> 07:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
competitive construction grant under the
 
07:17:37.750 --> 07:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
new starts program after what i am sure
 
07:17:40.310 --> 07:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
would be a full and vigorous debate on
 
07:17:41.910 --> 07:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
the financial plan
 
07:17:43.670 --> 07:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
nothing in what we have done so far
 
07:17:45.350 --> 07:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
obligates the state to proceed to
 
07:17:45.360 --> 07:17:46.468 align:start position:0%
obligates the state to proceed to
construction

07:17:46.468 --> 07:17:46.478 align:start position:0%
construction
 
07:17:48.788 --> 07:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
or to repay any of the federal funds
 
07:17:50.548 --> 07:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
that have been used
 
07:17:52.628 --> 07:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
amtrak operates the downeaster from
 
07:17:55.190 --> 07:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
boston into maine and the vermonter that
 
07:17:56.868 --> 07:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
crosses into new hampshire to make a
 
07:17:59.190 --> 07:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
stop in claremont these are not using
 
07:18:01.990 --> 07:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
state funds at this time but they may
 
07:18:04.070 --> 07:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
may wish to in the future
 
07:18:05.830 --> 07:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
knowing all of this we can see that the
 
07:18:07.990 --> 07:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
bill does nothing to advance the
 
07:18:09.910 --> 07:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
intention to stop the capital corridor
 
07:18:12.628 --> 07:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
project since no state funds are being
 
07:18:12.638 --> 07:18:13.590 align:start position:0%
project since no state funds are being
used

07:18:13.590 --> 07:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
used
 
07:18:15.430 --> 07:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
there is strong public support for
 
07:18:17.750 --> 07:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
commuter rail i looked at a poll over
 
07:18:19.910 --> 07:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
the weekend that was over 70 percent in
 
07:18:19.920 --> 07:18:20.868 align:start position:0%
the weekend that was over 70 percent in
support

07:18:20.868 --> 07:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
support
 
07:18:23.110 --> 07:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
not having rail makes it more difficult
 
07:18:26.310 --> 07:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
for employers to attract workers some of
 
07:18:28.310 --> 07:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
those workers might be the
 
07:18:30.388 --> 07:18:30.398 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency developers that we heard
 
07:18:32.070 --> 07:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
about on tuesday
 
07:18:34.070 --> 07:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would send a terrible
 
07:18:35.350 --> 07:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
message about how willing the
 
07:18:38.230 --> 07:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
legislature is to listen to its citizens
 
07:18:39.750 --> 07:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
and businesses
 
07:18:41.910 --> 07:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
we avoid appropriating funds outside of
 
07:18:44.230 --> 07:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
the budget cycle and it is equally wrong
 
07:18:45.830 --> 07:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill that would restrict the
 
07:18:47.110 --> 07:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
use of funds
 
07:18:49.510 --> 07:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the budget cycle i encourage
 
07:18:51.350 --> 07:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
members to join me in pressing the red
 
07:18:52.388 --> 07:18:52.398 align:start position:0%
button it is
 
07:18:53.670 --> 07:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
hang on
 
07:18:55.270 --> 07:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's super noisy in here can somebody
 
07:18:59.030 --> 07:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:01.110 --> 07:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
sorry about that please continue
 
07:19:02.788 --> 07:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
i encourage members to join me in
 
07:19:04.388 --> 07:19:04.398 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button to defeat the
 
07:19:06.310 --> 07:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion so another motion
 
07:19:11.350 --> 07:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:12.708 --> 07:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're not too comfy out
 
07:19:17.350 --> 07:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:18.948 --> 07:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
the member from bedford representative
 
07:19:20.788 --> 07:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
graham is recognized to speak in favor
 
07:19:22.230 --> 07:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the motion
 
07:19:24.788 --> 07:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
he's the last speaker i'd be shocked if
 
07:19:25.750 --> 07:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
this was
 
07:19:27.110 --> 07:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
they've already asked for division vote
 
07:19:28.628 --> 07:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
on this so members should start
 
07:19:30.788 --> 07:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
migrating back
 
07:19:35.430 --> 07:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
quietly please um thank you mr speaker
 
07:19:38.150 --> 07:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of the ought to pass
 
07:19:41.990 --> 07:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
motion on hb 1432
 
07:19:44.708 --> 07:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
let's talk about this for a little bit
 
07:19:47.430 --> 07:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
it is not whether or not passenger rail
 
07:19:49.590 --> 07:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
is going to come to new hampshire
 
07:19:52.230 --> 07:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
that is a policy decision for another
 
07:19:52.240 --> 07:19:53.670 align:start position:0%
that is a policy decision for another
day

07:19:53.670 --> 07:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
day
 
07:19:55.430 --> 07:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
it is not about
 
07:19:57.990 --> 07:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
private public partnerships with the
 
07:20:01.590 --> 07:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions of the state that
 
07:20:05.350 --> 07:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
is their decision to make in the future
 
07:20:07.670 --> 07:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
is also unfortunately
 
07:20:09.510 --> 07:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
not about ancillary costs to
 
07:20:09.520 --> 07:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
not about ancillary costs to
municipalities

07:20:11.030 --> 07:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
07:20:14.310 --> 07:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
in any rail corridor and there will be
 
07:20:17.830 --> 07:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
some if this is ever built
 
07:20:21.270 --> 07:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
it is not about stopping the ongoing
 
07:20:24.708 --> 07:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
project development plan for the capital
 
07:20:26.948 --> 07:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
rail corridor project
 
07:20:29.750 --> 07:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is being done with federal monies
 
07:20:32.628 --> 07:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
and is well underway with a report date
 
07:20:38.070 --> 07:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
for that study in early 2023
 
07:20:40.310 --> 07:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
we have some preliminary reports from it
 
07:20:43.350 --> 07:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
but nothing that that really indicates
 
07:20:45.510 --> 07:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost
 
07:20:45.520 --> 07:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost
this

07:20:47.590 --> 07:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:20:47.600 --> 07:20:48.868 align:start position:0%
this
report

07:20:48.868 --> 07:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
report
 
07:20:51.030 --> 07:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
will cover cons what it costs for
 
07:20:51.040 --> 07:20:52.708 align:start position:0%
will cover cons what it costs for
construction

07:20:52.708 --> 07:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
construction
 
07:20:52.718 --> 07:20:54.310 align:start position:0%
construction
operating

07:20:54.310 --> 07:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
operating
 
07:20:54.320 --> 07:20:55.830 align:start position:0%
operating
maintenance

07:20:55.830 --> 07:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
07:20:59.270 --> 07:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
whatever else is needed
 
07:21:02.948 --> 07:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
to include if we have to put down
 
07:21:05.430 --> 07:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
new rail or anything else
 
07:21:07.910 --> 07:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
and it will also address funding sources
 
07:21:09.750 --> 07:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
to pay for all of this
 
07:21:12.230 --> 07:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
which will in probability taking in
 
07:21:14.468 --> 07:21:14.478 align:start position:0%
total be in the hundreds of millions of
 
07:21:14.478 --> 07:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
total be in the hundreds of millions of
dollars

07:21:16.070 --> 07:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:21:19.510 --> 07:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
what it is is a statement that the
 
07:21:21.990 --> 07:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
07:21:23.430 --> 07:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
will not
 
07:21:26.150 --> 07:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
be used as the piggy bank
 
07:21:30.388 --> 07:21:30.398 align:start position:0%
for passenger rail service
 
07:21:33.190 --> 07:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is clearly tell
 
07:21:35.430 --> 07:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
those making the recommendations on
 
07:21:35.440 --> 07:21:36.548 align:start position:0%
those making the recommendations on
funding

07:21:36.548 --> 07:21:36.558 align:start position:0%
funding
 
07:21:38.708 --> 07:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire
 
07:21:42.628 --> 07:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
will not be providing the funds
 
07:21:45.510 --> 07:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
it will also clearly
 
07:21:47.430 --> 07:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
make clear
 
07:21:50.070 --> 07:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
to the department of transportation
 
07:21:52.310 --> 07:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
that when they come in within this
 
07:21:54.070 --> 07:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
project that they're going to have to
 
07:21:57.430 --> 07:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
have funding sources outside of state
 
07:21:57.440 --> 07:21:59.270 align:start position:0%
have funding sources outside of state
monies

07:21:59.270 --> 07:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
monies
 
07:22:02.150 --> 07:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
i ask for your support and not to pass
 
07:22:05.590 --> 07:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
so that we have a position to lay down
 
07:22:07.270 --> 07:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
in front of this
 
07:22:09.590 --> 07:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
project development phase and in front
 
07:22:11.830 --> 07:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner of d.o.t
 
07:22:11.840 --> 07:22:12.548 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner of d.o.t
that

07:22:12.548 --> 07:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:22:14.788 --> 07:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
if we are going to do passenger rail
 
07:22:17.110 --> 07:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
service anywhere in the state
 
07:22:19.830 --> 07:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
that it will not be done
 
07:22:23.190 --> 07:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire funds and i ask that
 
07:22:26.868 --> 07:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
you uh support the uh to pass motion i
 
07:22:28.548 --> 07:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
was going to say the majority but it was
 
07:22:30.948 --> 07:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
07:22:34.070 --> 07:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
so please support ought to pass and i
 
07:22:39.270 --> 07:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:40.868 --> 07:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
well only one of you can request the
 
07:22:47.430 --> 07:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:47.440 --> 07:22:48.628 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:22:48.628 --> 07:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:22:50.468 --> 07:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
request a roll call and it's already
 
07:22:52.230 --> 07:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
well seconded this will be a roll call
 
07:22:52.240 --> 07:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
well seconded this will be a roll call

07:24:11.670 --> 07:24:11.680 align:start position:0%

members
 
07:24:50.868 --> 07:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
if i
 
07:24:54.310 --> 07:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
know according to a 2019
 
07:24:56.468 --> 07:24:56.478 align:start position:0%
poll conducted by a new hampshire
 
07:25:00.788 --> 07:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
business publication that 75 percent of
 
07:25:03.910 --> 07:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
our state's residents support bringing
 
07:25:07.270 --> 07:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
passenger rail to southern new hampshire
 
07:25:10.388 --> 07:25:10.398 align:start position:0%
and if i believe this bill is premature
 
07:25:12.868 --> 07:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
because now the project development
 
07:25:15.270 --> 07:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
phase of the proposed capital corridor
 
07:25:18.788 --> 07:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
railing is being done using federal
 
07:25:18.798 --> 07:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
railing is being done using federal
funds

07:25:20.070 --> 07:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
funds
 
07:25:23.270 --> 07:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
and in in a phase that will be complete
 
07:25:26.948 --> 07:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
should be completed in 2023
 
07:25:29.830 --> 07:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
then the next term those of us who
 
07:25:32.708 --> 07:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
return next term will have a chance to
 
07:25:35.990 --> 07:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
debate how we pay for this project which
 
07:25:40.230 --> 07:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
may or may not include state funds
 
07:25:42.868 --> 07:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know
 
07:25:45.830 --> 07:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
that if let's say this bill were to pass
 
07:25:47.590 --> 07:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
and become law
 
07:25:50.628 --> 07:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
a future legislature could easily
 
07:25:53.670 --> 07:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
repeal it next term or later
 
07:25:53.680 --> 07:25:54.830 align:start position:0%
repeal it next term or later
because

07:25:54.830 --> 07:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:25:58.948 --> 07:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
no current legislature can ever bind
 
07:26:02.230 --> 07:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
future legislatures in this or other
 
07:26:05.590 --> 07:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
policy matters would i now press the red
 
07:26:08.548 --> 07:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
button and oppose the ought to pass
 
07:26:12.708 --> 07:26:12.718 align:start position:0%

07:26:35.510 --> 07:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
i know nothing in this bill prohibits
 
07:26:39.190 --> 07:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision of the state
 
07:26:41.510 --> 07:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
such as manchester or nashua from
 
07:26:43.670 --> 07:26:43.680 align:start position:0%

house bill 2022 as presented wants to
 
07:30:41.030 --> 07:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
give back 2.5 miles of state roadway
 
07:30:42.708 --> 07:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
back to the town of merrimack currently
 
07:30:44.948 --> 07:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
known as continental boulevard
 
07:30:46.708 --> 07:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
we don't want it
 
07:30:48.948 --> 07:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
this road came about in 1993 when the
 
07:30:50.868 --> 07:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
d.o.t acquired lands through eminent
 
07:30:53.750 --> 07:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
domain proceedings to build the road
 
07:30:55.670 --> 07:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack back then argued
 
07:30:57.430 --> 07:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
against eminent domain proceedings for
 
07:30:59.590 --> 07:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard but the d.o.t
 
07:31:02.868 --> 07:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
prevailed arguing that public necessity
 
07:31:04.628 --> 07:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
for the use of private property for this
 
07:31:07.190 --> 07:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
stretch of road was needed by the public
 
07:31:09.350 --> 07:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the region for the greater good
 
07:31:11.270 --> 07:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
some 30 odd years later continental
 
07:31:13.590 --> 07:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
boulevard continues to serve
 
07:31:16.150 --> 07:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
as a primary arterial connection for
 
07:31:18.230 --> 07:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
route 101a running west to east from
 
07:31:19.750 --> 07:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
milford to nashua
 
07:31:22.708 --> 07:31:22.718 align:start position:0%

daniel webster highway us-3
 
07:31:27.590 --> 07:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
this connection carries more than 17 000
 
07:31:29.590 --> 07:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles per day many of which are from
 
07:31:31.590 --> 07:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities
 
07:31:33.430 --> 07:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
more than 10 000 of those vehicles can
 
07:31:35.030 --> 07:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
be found in traffic counts along

boulevard
 
07:31:39.510 --> 07:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
the traffic volumes on the state section
 
07:31:41.750 --> 07:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
of continental boulevard exceed those of
 
07:31:43.670 --> 07:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
any merrimack public road
 
07:31:45.350 --> 07:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
including the urban compact section of
 
07:31:47.110 --> 07:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
daniel webster highway that carries a
 
07:31:51.750 --> 07:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
traffic volume of 14 550 cars daily
 
07:31:53.830 --> 07:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
the demand for a high level of service
 
07:31:55.830 --> 07:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
will be constant as this roadway remains
 
07:31:56.948 --> 07:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
a critical part of the state's
 
07:31:59.430 --> 07:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as a primary artery
 
07:32:01.670 --> 07:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
between the major east-west and

north-south route in southern new
 
07:32:05.270 --> 07:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire region
 
07:32:06.708 --> 07:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
now the argument is being made that the
 
07:32:09.030 --> 07:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
stretch of roadway is no longer
 
07:32:10.788 --> 07:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
needed as a public necessity to the
 
07:32:10.798 --> 07:32:11.990 align:start position:0%
needed as a public necessity to the
state

07:32:11.990 --> 07:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:32:14.070 --> 07:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
d.o.t seeks to abdicate its ownership
 
07:32:15.990 --> 07:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
from a roadway it richly wanted back in
 
07:32:16.000 --> 07:32:18.150 align:start position:0%
from a roadway it richly wanted back in
1993.

07:32:18.150 --> 07:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
1993.
 
07:32:20.468 --> 07:32:20.478 align:start position:0%
the town's absorption of this roadway to
 
07:32:22.310 --> 07:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
our town's budget is an additional 200
 
07:32:25.030 --> 07:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
000 annually with potential long-term
 
07:32:27.270 --> 07:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
capital costs exceeding 2.5 million
 
07:32:29.190 --> 07:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
dollars over the next 20 years and
 
07:32:31.350 --> 07:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's infrastructure not including
 
07:32:33.350 --> 07:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
staffing equipment and other ancillary
 
07:32:34.948 --> 07:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
components necessary to maintain the
 
07:32:34.958 --> 07:32:36.230 align:start position:0%
components necessary to maintain the
roadway

07:32:36.230 --> 07:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
roadway
 
07:32:37.990 --> 07:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
furthermore the road
 
07:32:40.708 --> 07:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
the town also gets the roadway in its
 
07:32:42.548 --> 07:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
supporting infrastructure
 
07:32:44.070 --> 07:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
as is
 
07:32:45.910 --> 07:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
no caveat emptor
 
07:32:47.750 --> 07:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
just the town being gifted a piece of
 
07:32:49.830 --> 07:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that the town didn't want
 
07:32:53.750 --> 07:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
in 1993 and still doesn't want today
 
07:32:55.510 --> 07:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
as you deliberate this amendment please
 
07:32:57.030 --> 07:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
consider that this application of
 
07:32:58.948 --> 07:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
content at the boulevard by the d.o.t to
 
07:33:01.270 --> 07:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack could also happen
 
07:33:02.708 --> 07:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
in your community
 
07:33:04.788 --> 07:33:04.798 align:start position:0%

um representative how much would this
 
07:34:01.030 --> 07:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
cost the town of merrimack to repave the
 
07:34:05.190 --> 07:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:07.190 --> 07:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
i thank the gentlelady for the question
 
07:34:09.430 --> 07:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
the maintenance cost
 
07:34:10.868 --> 07:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
potentially for paving the search of
 
07:34:14.150 --> 07:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
roadway is 200 000. what i can know that
 
07:34:16.310 --> 07:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
was brought up in testimony in committee
 
07:34:19.350 --> 07:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
was that the d.o.t in 2017 bonded the
 
07:34:20.628 --> 07:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
stretcher road for seven hundred
 
07:34:26.388 --> 07:34:26.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:28.070 --> 07:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
the member from hinsdale representative
 
07:34:30.388 --> 07:34:30.398 align:start position:0%
abbott is recognized to speak
 
07:34:34.500 --> 07:34:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:34.510 --> 07:34:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:34:36.230 --> 07:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:34:38.628 --> 07:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:34:41.750 --> 07:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's been asserted that this incident
 
07:34:43.990 --> 07:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
with continental boulevard was an
 
07:34:46.708 --> 07:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
attempt to downshift
 
07:34:49.990 --> 07:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
to the merrimack community
 
07:34:51.830 --> 07:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
the expense of this
 
07:34:51.840 --> 07:34:53.190 align:start position:0%
the expense of this
area

07:34:53.190 --> 07:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
area
 
07:34:56.548 --> 07:34:56.558 align:start position:0%
uh this if it was i would be voting
 
07:34:58.548 --> 07:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
for it
 
07:35:00.788 --> 07:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not voting for it
 
07:35:02.948 --> 07:35:02.958 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
07:35:04.468 --> 07:35:04.478 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
07:35:09.270 --> 07:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
the average cost according to the dot
 
07:35:11.030 --> 07:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
for this roadway
 
07:35:14.948 --> 07:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
that they plow and pave is 80 000
 
07:35:19.110 --> 07:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:21.430 --> 07:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
initially merrimack
 
07:35:24.388 --> 07:35:24.398 align:start position:0%
wanted to have continental boulevard it
 
07:35:26.868 --> 07:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
is not a state highway
 
07:35:30.468 --> 07:35:30.478 align:start position:0%
it is a municipal road
 
07:35:30.478 --> 07:35:31.350 align:start position:0%
it is a municipal road
and

07:35:31.350 --> 07:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:35:33.750 --> 07:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted it because they wanted to
 
07:35:36.548 --> 07:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
develop it they wanted to bring digital
 
07:35:39.750 --> 07:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
in they wanted to bring other industries
 
07:35:42.230 --> 07:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
into merrimack
 
07:35:44.548 --> 07:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
in exchange for that
 
07:35:47.670 --> 07:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike system
 
07:35:50.868 --> 07:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
exit 10 11 and 12
 
07:35:52.948 --> 07:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
in merrimack
 
07:35:52.958 --> 07:35:54.788 align:start position:0%
in merrimack
were

07:35:54.788 --> 07:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
were
 
07:35:54.798 --> 07:35:57.190 align:start position:0%
were
created

07:35:57.190 --> 07:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
created
 
07:36:00.388 --> 07:36:00.398 align:start position:0%
eventually this became a problem for the
 
07:36:02.788 --> 07:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
citizens of merrimack
 
07:36:06.070 --> 07:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to pay the tolls
 
07:36:08.868 --> 07:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
so it was eliminated
 
07:36:12.788 --> 07:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
the toll booth at exit 12
 
07:36:15.910 --> 07:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
and then with the exit 11 there was a
 
07:36:15.920 --> 07:36:17.590 align:start position:0%
and then with the exit 11 there was a
bill

07:36:17.590 --> 07:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:36:19.750 --> 07:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
presented to our committee
 
07:36:22.230 --> 07:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
to have
 
07:36:22.240 --> 07:36:23.110 align:start position:0%
to have
the

07:36:23.110 --> 07:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:36:26.708 --> 07:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
tolls eliminated at exit 11. that did
 
07:36:29.750 --> 07:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
not happen by vote 18 to 2 it was
 
07:36:29.760 --> 07:36:31.750 align:start position:0%
not happen by vote 18 to 2 it was
defeated

07:36:31.750 --> 07:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
07:36:32.868 --> 07:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
and then
 
07:36:34.708 --> 07:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
it went
 
07:36:36.788 --> 07:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
what they did is they went to the
 
07:36:39.030 --> 07:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
07:36:41.270 --> 07:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
who sets the tolls
 
07:36:44.948 --> 07:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
and got them to set the toll at exit 11
 
07:36:46.868 --> 07:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
at zero
 
07:36:48.708 --> 07:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
which eliminated
 
07:36:51.190 --> 07:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
that from the scheme
 
07:36:52.388 --> 07:36:52.398 align:start position:0%
and now
 
07:36:55.990 --> 07:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
they've passed a bill to get rid of the
 
07:36:58.150 --> 07:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
tolls at exit 10.
 
07:37:00.548 --> 07:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
so in other words they're getting no
 
07:37:02.230 --> 07:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
toll money
 
07:37:04.468 --> 07:37:04.478 align:start position:0%
and what you have to understand
 
07:37:06.628 --> 07:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
that all the total money
 
07:37:08.468 --> 07:37:08.478 align:start position:0%
from the turnpikes
 
07:37:12.548 --> 07:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
has to be spent on a turnpike
 
07:37:14.070 --> 07:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
and at the time
 
07:37:15.830 --> 07:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
when it first happened
 
07:37:18.150 --> 07:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
the salt sheds in the storage areas
 
07:37:19.830 --> 07:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
where the trucks
 
07:37:22.628 --> 07:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
the state trucks were a long continental
 
07:37:22.638 --> 07:37:24.070 align:start position:0%
the state trucks were a long continental
boulevard

07:37:24.070 --> 07:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
boulevard
 
07:37:27.350 --> 07:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
that has since gone away
 
07:37:27.360 --> 07:37:29.510 align:start position:0%
that has since gone away
so

07:37:29.510 --> 07:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:37:32.230 --> 07:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
what the expenses are now
 
07:37:35.350 --> 07:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
were the elimination of the tolls at
 
07:37:36.948 --> 07:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
exit 10
 
07:37:39.350 --> 07:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
and 11 and 12
 
07:37:41.270 --> 07:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
is 1.7
 
07:37:44.830 --> 07:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually again
 
07:37:49.750 --> 07:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
1.7 million dollars annually
 
07:37:53.030 --> 07:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
the cost to remove the toll plazas
 
07:37:58.948 --> 07:37:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:01.190 --> 07:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
the other point is
 
07:38:01.200 --> 07:38:02.388 align:start position:0%
the other point is
that

07:38:02.388 --> 07:38:02.398 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:38:04.708 --> 07:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
when the money that is collected from
 
07:38:06.230 --> 07:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
the tolls
 
07:38:09.190 --> 07:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
what it has to be used for and again
 
07:38:11.590 --> 07:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
only on the turnpike
 
07:38:14.070 --> 07:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
is for winter maintenance first that's
 
07:38:15.990 --> 07:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
the priority
 
07:38:18.388 --> 07:38:18.398 align:start position:0%
second is preservation
 
07:38:21.750 --> 07:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the third is any new projects
 
07:38:24.468 --> 07:38:24.478 align:start position:0%
so what this is mean that all these
 
07:38:24.478 --> 07:38:25.670 align:start position:0%
so what this is mean that all these
projects

07:38:25.670 --> 07:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
projects
 
07:38:27.750 --> 07:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be delayed
 
07:38:30.548 --> 07:38:30.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are going to be delayed
 
07:38:33.190 --> 07:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
because the money the revenue was not
 
07:38:33.200 --> 07:38:41.430 align:start position:0%
because the money the revenue was not
there

07:38:41.430 --> 07:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:44.830 --> 07:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
i think that it would make more sense
 
07:38:44.840 --> 07:38:46.628 align:start position:0%
i think that it would make more sense
for

07:38:46.628 --> 07:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:38:48.468 --> 07:38:48.478 align:start position:0%
and i question the fact
 
07:38:50.708 --> 07:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to cost merrick mack
 
07:38:53.590 --> 07:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
the sum that they said i will tell you
 
07:38:54.948 --> 07:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
07:38:54.958 --> 07:38:56.548 align:start position:0%
that it was
repaved

07:38:56.548 --> 07:38:56.558 align:start position:0%
repaved
 
07:39:00.150 --> 07:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
in 2017 and it's an average of five
 
07:39:02.868 --> 07:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
years for it to go
 
07:39:05.830 --> 07:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
and the cost to remove
 
07:39:07.830 --> 07:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
the total booth
 
07:39:10.070 --> 07:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
at exit 10
 
07:39:12.548 --> 07:39:12.558 align:start position:0%
which is in the 10-year plan
 
07:39:15.430 --> 07:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
is hundred thousand dollars
 
07:39:20.948 --> 07:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:22.628 --> 07:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
the member from merrimack representative
 
07:39:24.310 --> 07:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
wrong is recognized to speak in support
 
07:39:26.788 --> 07:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
07:39:29.190 --> 07:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:39:32.628 --> 07:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
i come before you in support of this
 
07:39:34.388 --> 07:39:34.398 align:start position:0%
minority amendment
 
07:39:36.150 --> 07:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
it removes from the 10-year
 
07:39:39.350 --> 07:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
transportation plan as we amended it
 
07:39:41.510 --> 07:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
the transfer of continental boulevard a
 
07:39:44.388 --> 07:39:44.398 align:start position:0%
state road to the town of merrimack
 
07:39:46.948 --> 07:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
the reasoning for making this transfer
 
07:39:49.350 --> 07:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
is that since merrimack no longer has
 
07:39:51.830 --> 07:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
the three ramp tolls which supported the
 
07:39:54.388 --> 07:39:54.398 align:start position:0%
everett turnpike we should take on the
 
07:39:56.868 --> 07:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
more than two hundred thousand dollars
 
07:39:58.548 --> 07:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
expense of maintaining this road
 
07:39:58.558 --> 07:39:59.670 align:start position:0%
expense of maintaining this road
annually

07:39:59.670 --> 07:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
annually
 
07:40:02.708 --> 07:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
it is outrageous and illogical as well
 
07:40:04.230 --> 07:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
as unjust
 
07:40:05.990 --> 07:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
here is why
 
07:40:08.150 --> 07:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
first off let me tell you about
 
07:40:11.430 --> 07:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard it is a connector
 
07:40:14.230 --> 07:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
planned and built by the state to join
 
07:40:17.910 --> 07:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
101a with the everett turnpikes exit 10
 
07:40:19.270 --> 07:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
and 11
 
07:40:21.350 --> 07:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
both state roads
 
07:40:23.670 --> 07:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
it is considered part of the turnpike
 
07:40:23.680 --> 07:40:25.190 align:start position:0%
it is considered part of the turnpike
system

07:40:25.190 --> 07:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:40:27.990 --> 07:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is not a road for townspeople to
 
07:40:29.670 --> 07:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
navigate merrimack
 
07:40:31.350 --> 07:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
there are no homes on continental
 
07:40:31.360 --> 07:40:32.548 align:start position:0%
there are no homes on continental
boulevard

07:40:32.548 --> 07:40:32.558 align:start position:0%
boulevard
 
07:40:35.430 --> 07:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
it is primarily used to get travelers
 
07:40:38.388 --> 07:40:38.398 align:start position:0%
from one state road to another
 
07:40:40.948 --> 07:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
it exists for the benefit of state
 
07:40:40.958 --> 07:40:42.628 align:start position:0%
it exists for the benefit of state
transportation

07:40:42.628 --> 07:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
07:40:45.310 --> 07:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
to think that a town should take over
 
07:40:47.430 --> 07:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this road is
 
07:40:47.440 --> 07:40:49.270 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this road is
ridiculous

07:40:49.270 --> 07:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
07:40:49.280 --> 07:40:50.388 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
second

07:40:50.388 --> 07:40:50.398 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:40:53.430 --> 07:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
to justify that this transfer
 
07:40:56.310 --> 07:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
to justify this transfer because of the
 
07:40:59.350 --> 07:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
closure of the merrimack ramp tools is
 
07:41:01.110 --> 07:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
also ridiculous
 
07:41:03.750 --> 07:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
for decades decades
 
07:41:07.110 --> 07:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
merrimack residents paid for the cost
 
07:41:10.310 --> 07:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
for the turnpike every time a merrimack
 
07:41:13.590 --> 07:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
resident got on or off to go to work or
 
07:41:14.868 --> 07:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
to go home
 
07:41:18.868 --> 07:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
while tens of thousands of drivers south
 
07:41:22.548 --> 07:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
of merrimack paid nothing
 
07:41:25.510 --> 07:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
tolls are user fees
 
07:41:32.388 --> 07:41:32.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:32.398 --> 07:41:33.430 align:start position:0%
 
not

07:41:33.430 --> 07:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:41:36.230 --> 07:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
just some others who get shouldered with
 
07:41:37.830 --> 07:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
the burden
 
07:41:39.750 --> 07:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have a toll booth
 
07:41:42.628 --> 07:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
at the northern boundary of the turnpike
 
07:41:44.150 --> 07:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
in hooksett
 
07:41:47.270 --> 07:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
but the state failed to put one in at
 
07:41:49.270 --> 07:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
the southern boundary
 
07:41:52.628 --> 07:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
even though that road the tunnel and
 
07:41:55.510 --> 07:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
other infrastructure is already in place
 
07:41:58.230 --> 07:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
for a toll booth in nashua
 
07:42:00.468 --> 07:42:00.478 align:start position:0%
so the heaviest eight miles of the
 
07:42:03.510 --> 07:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
turnpike from the state line through
 
07:42:03.520 --> 07:42:05.350 align:start position:0%
turnpike from the state line through
nashua

07:42:05.350 --> 07:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
07:42:07.030 --> 07:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
have not paid
 
07:42:10.388 --> 07:42:10.398 align:start position:0%
one penny for that use
 
07:42:12.548 --> 07:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
nor for the new ramps
 
07:42:14.150 --> 07:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
and bridge work
 
07:42:17.510 --> 07:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
nada zilch zero
 
07:42:20.628 --> 07:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
i would go as far to say that if the
 
07:42:23.750 --> 07:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
state kept to their plan to have a toll
 
07:42:26.708 --> 07:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
in nashua the turnpike system would be
 
07:42:29.350 --> 07:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
flush with money and we wouldn't be
 
07:42:32.150 --> 07:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
having this discussion today
 
07:42:35.430 --> 07:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
the last point i want to make is this
 
07:42:35.440 --> 07:42:36.388 align:start position:0%
the last point i want to make is this
plan

07:42:36.388 --> 07:42:36.398 align:start position:0%
plan
 
07:42:38.788 --> 07:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
is to dump the cost of continental
 
07:42:41.670 --> 07:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
boulevard on merrimack
 
07:42:43.910 --> 07:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
comes without any discussion with our
 
07:42:47.270 --> 07:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
town leaders or dpw department
 
07:42:48.990 --> 07:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
it takes what should be a
 
07:42:51.350 --> 07:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
state-supported cost
 
07:42:54.468 --> 07:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
and turns it into a property tax
 
07:42:58.070 --> 07:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
increase for the residents of merrimack
 
07:43:00.628 --> 07:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
so for all the people of my community
 
07:43:03.190 --> 07:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
who don't even travel to on continental
 
07:43:05.910 --> 07:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
boulevard will have their property taxes
 
07:43:05.920 --> 07:43:07.430 align:start position:0%
boulevard will have their property taxes
increased

07:43:07.430 --> 07:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
increased
 
07:43:09.670 --> 07:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
so the state can make up
 
07:43:13.030 --> 07:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
its turnpike revenue losses
 
07:43:15.750 --> 07:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is not a user fee that is not a
 
07:43:18.948 --> 07:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
toll it is an injustice of government
 
07:43:20.868 --> 07:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
don't allow it to happen
 
07:43:23.430 --> 07:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
please vote green in support of this
 
07:43:27.430 --> 07:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
amendment enough is enough thank you
 
07:43:30.628 --> 07:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
does the member yield for a question no
 
07:43:33.030 --> 07:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
member does not yield
 
07:43:34.548 --> 07:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
the member from bedford representative
 
07:43:36.150 --> 07:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
graham is recognized to speak against
 
07:43:39.590 --> 07:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:40.628 --> 07:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:43:43.110 --> 07:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
mr speaker mr speaker i rise in
 
07:43:45.830 --> 07:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to the minority amendment
 
07:43:47.590 --> 07:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what it does first i
 
07:43:49.990 --> 07:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody hit that
 
07:43:53.110 --> 07:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
it modifies the majority amendment by
 
07:43:55.190 --> 07:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
taking out one section
 
07:43:57.590 --> 07:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
it takes out the the very first section
 
07:43:59.910 --> 07:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
that says transfer of ownership of
 
07:44:03.030 --> 07:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard it re leaves the
 
07:44:05.590 --> 07:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the majority amendment in place
 
07:44:07.270 --> 07:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
i just want everybody to make sure they
 
07:44:09.030 --> 07:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
07:44:10.628 --> 07:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
when they're voting
 
07:44:12.868 --> 07:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background
 
07:44:15.270 --> 07:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
you've heard it here i'll recap the
 
07:44:18.230 --> 07:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
exits in merrimack were constructed by
 
07:44:19.990 --> 07:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
the turnpike
 
07:44:22.388 --> 07:44:22.398 align:start position:0%
some at the request of the town
 
07:44:24.948 --> 07:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
for development especially for digital
 
07:44:27.030 --> 07:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
corp now fidelity
 
07:44:29.190 --> 07:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
the town acknowledged that they would be
 
07:44:29.200 --> 07:44:30.388 align:start position:0%
the town acknowledged that they would be
told

07:44:30.388 --> 07:44:30.398 align:start position:0%
told
 
07:44:32.708 --> 07:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
but it led to the development of large
 
07:44:34.788 --> 07:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
sections of merrimack
 
07:44:36.948 --> 07:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
and it allowed both business and
 
07:44:39.670 --> 07:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
industrial development
 
07:44:42.388 --> 07:44:42.398 align:start position:0%
over the past several terms these sole
 
07:44:45.030 --> 07:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
plazas have been removed
 
07:44:47.830 --> 07:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
and bills that i deem must pass let me
 
07:44:50.788 --> 07:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
give you a couple examples in 2020 a
 
07:44:53.590 --> 07:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
democratic senator inserted the removal
 
07:44:55.750 --> 07:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
of one of the toll plazas and one of
 
07:44:57.270 --> 07:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
those infamous
 
07:44:59.510 --> 07:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills that the speaker and
 
07:45:02.070 --> 07:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
senate president agreed would not have a
 
07:45:06.230 --> 07:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee a conference last year 2021 a
 
07:45:08.788 --> 07:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
republican center added the removal of a
 
07:45:12.150 --> 07:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
toll plaza in the house bill 2
 
07:45:14.468 --> 07:45:14.478 align:start position:0%
while it was in the senate
 
07:45:16.708 --> 07:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
so the last messages of the grand
 
07:45:19.830 --> 07:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
agreement that opened up merrimack for
 
07:45:22.070 --> 07:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
development is the turnpike's ownership
 
07:45:24.548 --> 07:45:24.558 align:start position:0%
of a portion of continental boulevard
 
07:45:26.628 --> 07:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's to find the time to finish the
 
07:45:29.350 --> 07:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
breakup of this bargain
 
07:45:32.310 --> 07:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
by transferring the road to the town
 
07:45:34.310 --> 07:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard different costs
 
07:45:36.708 --> 07:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
i'll accept what my good colleague from
 
07:45:38.868 --> 07:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
merrimack said that it's two hundred
 
07:45:41.830 --> 07:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars maintenance and 2.5 in
 
07:45:44.310 --> 07:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
the in the longer term
 
07:45:46.948 --> 07:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
if that is the cost of the town that is
 
07:45:49.590 --> 07:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of the turnpike system
 
07:45:51.590 --> 07:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
and so everybody who goes through
 
07:45:54.548 --> 07:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
another toll plaza will be paying that
 
07:45:57.510 --> 07:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
amount for the next however long we
 
07:45:59.110 --> 07:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
maintain control of continental
 
07:46:02.388 --> 07:46:02.398 align:start position:0%
boulevard that's not cost downshifting
 
07:46:04.788 --> 07:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
per se to me that is cost shifting to
 
07:46:07.270 --> 07:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
every other person who uses the turnpike
 
07:46:07.280 --> 07:46:09.750 align:start position:0%
every other person who uses the turnpike
system

07:46:09.750 --> 07:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:46:11.830 --> 07:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
you've heard the talks about
 
07:46:13.910 --> 07:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
what it will cost to finish up the
 
07:46:16.310 --> 07:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
removal of the toll plazas but the other
 
07:46:17.990 --> 07:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
thing that has happened within the
 
07:46:19.670 --> 07:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
turnpike system
 
07:46:21.350 --> 07:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
is that because
 
07:46:22.788 --> 07:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
of this
 
07:46:25.510 --> 07:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures and others we've had to
 
07:46:28.150 --> 07:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
delay in this 10-year plan all of the
 
07:46:31.350 --> 07:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
major turnpike projects by at least two
 
07:46:31.360 --> 07:46:32.868 align:start position:0%
major turnpike projects by at least two
years

07:46:32.868 --> 07:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:46:35.510 --> 07:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
we can continue to do that
 
07:46:38.708 --> 07:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
that's up to this body to
 
07:46:42.388 --> 07:46:42.398 align:start position:0%
decide for me it is an equity
 
07:46:44.708 --> 07:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
issue should those drivers on the
 
07:46:47.110 --> 07:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
spaulding of the rest of the everett pay
 
07:46:48.868 --> 07:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
for what is now in my opinion
 
07:46:51.350 --> 07:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
essentially a town thoroughfare
 
07:46:53.110 --> 07:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee does not
 
07:46:55.830 --> 07:46:55.840 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker so i i have to feel
 
07:54:19.190 --> 07:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
really badly for our colleagues over in
 
07:54:21.110 --> 07:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
07:54:23.190 --> 07:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
mostly because of my friend from salem
 
07:54:24.868 --> 07:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
who i have to listen to
 
07:54:27.190 --> 07:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
every time we meet about it
 
07:54:28.788 --> 07:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
all their bills are at the end of the
 
07:54:30.548 --> 07:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
day after everyone's tired and no one
 
07:54:32.788 --> 07:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
wants to pay attention and so forth
 
07:54:34.628 --> 07:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
but more importantly i have a chairman
 
07:54:36.388 --> 07:54:36.398 align:start position:0%
who needs to leave
 
07:54:38.310 --> 07:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
early and we're not going to get to his
 
07:54:40.708 --> 07:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
bills before he has to leave so
 
07:54:43.110 --> 07:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
we really need to hear from him
 
07:54:45.510 --> 07:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill so if you could please vote
 
07:54:55.670 --> 07:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:57.030 --> 07:54:57.040 align:start position:0%

07:55:39.670 --> 07:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
same with the following amendment and
 
07:55:40.948 --> 07:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the bill ought
 
07:55:42.868 --> 07:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
to pass with amendment representative

the minority of the committee having
 
07:55:48.708 --> 07:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
considered the same and being unable to
 
07:55:50.628 --> 07:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
07:55:52.788 --> 07:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill be referred
 
07:55:55.270 --> 07:55:55.280 align:start position:0%

now on the recommendation of octopass
 
07:56:24.628 --> 07:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
with amendment the member from hanover
 
07:56:26.070 --> 07:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative hopkins phillips is
 
07:56:27.430 --> 07:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak against the
 
07:56:38.070 --> 07:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:41.030 --> 07:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:56:43.510 --> 07:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hb
 
07:56:45.910 --> 07:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
1097 as amended
 
07:56:47.750 --> 07:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
i agree with my distinguished colleagues
 
07:56:49.510 --> 07:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
on the ways and means committee
 
07:56:51.510 --> 07:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the matter of remote employment and
 
07:56:54.310 --> 07:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
multi-state income taxation is worthy of
 
07:56:56.310 --> 07:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
protecting new hampshire residents in
 
07:56:58.230 --> 07:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
fact i love the idea behind the bill
 
07:57:00.150 --> 07:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's a marvelous talking point for our
 
07:57:02.708 --> 07:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
campaigns after all who here among us
 
07:57:04.468 --> 07:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
does not want to support new hampshire
 
07:57:04.478 --> 07:57:06.070 align:start position:0%
does not want to support new hampshire
workers

07:57:06.070 --> 07:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
workers
 
07:57:06.080 --> 07:57:07.430 align:start position:0%
workers
but

07:57:07.430 --> 07:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:57:09.830 --> 07:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
we must be sure that this legislation
 
07:57:12.548 --> 07:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
actually protects new hampshire workers
 
07:57:14.670 --> 07:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
and this cautious committee has
 
07:57:16.788 --> 07:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
uncharacteristically rushed to legislate
 
07:57:19.190 --> 07:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
in an area where fiscal prudence
 
07:57:21.350 --> 07:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
patience and study should drive our
 
07:57:23.990 --> 07:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
policy making mr speaker i oppose this
 
07:57:26.548 --> 07:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
bill for two primary reasons first i
 
07:57:28.230 --> 07:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill because it fails to
 
07:57:30.868 --> 07:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
properly consider the legal complexities
 
07:57:32.388 --> 07:57:32.398 align:start position:0%
involved in crafting a litigation
 
07:57:32.398 --> 07:57:33.510 align:start position:0%
involved in crafting a litigation
strategy

07:57:33.510 --> 07:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
07:57:35.990 --> 07:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
the majority lists several guesses why
 
07:57:37.830 --> 07:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
the previous litigation of this very
 
07:57:40.150 --> 07:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
matter was unsuccessful before the
 
07:57:42.230 --> 07:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court
 
07:57:44.070 --> 07:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
then selectively focuses the language
 
07:57:45.670 --> 07:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
here on a limited issue rather
 
07:57:47.510 --> 07:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
developing rather than developing a
 
07:57:49.910 --> 07:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
broad litigation approach
 
07:57:52.150 --> 07:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
after the amended language was offered
 
07:57:54.150 --> 07:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
the committee did not gather substantive
 
07:57:55.910 --> 07:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from constitutional
 
07:57:58.868 --> 07:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
interpretation or legal experts
 
07:58:01.590 --> 07:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
policy experts or independent tax
 
07:58:01.600 --> 07:58:02.868 align:start position:0%
policy experts or independent tax
experts

07:58:02.868 --> 07:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
experts
 
07:58:04.388 --> 07:58:04.398 align:start position:0%
the committee did not study the most
 
07:58:06.230 --> 07:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
likely reasons for the previous denial
 
07:58:08.788 --> 07:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
by the u.s supreme court nor did they
 
07:58:11.030 --> 07:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
identify the most likely pathway forward
 
07:58:13.510 --> 07:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
for future success
 
07:58:15.750 --> 07:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
instead the committee heard an assertion
 
07:58:17.510 --> 07:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general's office
 
07:58:20.070 --> 07:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
approved of the language offered
 
07:58:22.310 --> 07:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
and that a promise
 
07:58:24.310 --> 07:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
that the amended bill encompassed the
 
07:58:26.310 --> 07:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
strongest legal position for the state
 
07:58:28.628 --> 07:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
to protect its citizens
 
07:58:29.990 --> 07:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
no representative from the attorney
 
07:58:31.750 --> 07:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
general's office was made available to
 
07:58:33.830 --> 07:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
comment on that proposed language
 
07:58:35.990 --> 07:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
no additional hearings were held to
 
07:58:39.270 --> 07:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
verify those assertions to ask questions
 
07:58:40.868 --> 07:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
or to confirm the soundness of that
 
07:58:42.708 --> 07:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
legal strategy
 
07:58:44.628 --> 07:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
no new facts were presented to suggest
 
07:58:46.310 --> 07:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
that the timing of this legislation is
 
07:58:48.548 --> 07:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
urgent right now
 
07:58:48.558 --> 07:58:49.590 align:start position:0%
urgent right now
so

07:58:49.590 --> 07:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:58:51.910 --> 07:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
what does the state gain by rushing this
 
07:58:53.910 --> 07:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislation through and the consequences
 
07:58:56.708 --> 07:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
of being improperly prepared for future
 
07:58:56.718 --> 07:58:58.548 align:start position:0%
of being improperly prepared for future
litigation

07:58:58.548 --> 07:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
07:59:01.190 --> 07:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
is a huge greater risk
 
07:59:03.510 --> 07:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
make no mistake this bill could leave
 
07:59:05.670 --> 07:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in a worse position to
 
07:59:08.230 --> 07:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
defend its remote workers in the future
 
07:59:09.670 --> 07:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
and we should acknowledge that new
 
07:59:12.150 --> 07:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire taxpayers will be responsible
 
07:59:14.310 --> 07:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
for the tens if not thousands or
 
07:59:15.830 --> 07:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands
 
07:59:17.510 --> 07:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
of dollars to litigate
 
07:59:19.750 --> 07:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
a sub-optimal position
 
07:59:22.310 --> 07:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
the minority urges cautions and caution
 
07:59:23.590 --> 07:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
in proceeding without further
 
07:59:25.110 --> 07:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
investigation into the legal
 
07:59:26.708 --> 07:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
complexities here
 
07:59:29.910 --> 07:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
and second i oppose this bill
 
07:59:32.150 --> 07:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
for its technical deficiencies and with
 
07:59:34.468 --> 07:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
a little bit of irish luck you'll just
 
07:59:36.948 --> 07:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
hear me for one more moment
 
07:59:38.708 --> 07:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
the majority revised the mandatory
 
07:59:40.548 --> 07:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
language of the original bill
 
07:59:42.230 --> 07:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
and replaced it with a permissive
 
07:59:43.990 --> 07:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the state's sovereign
 
07:59:44.000 --> 07:59:45.110 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the state's sovereign
power

07:59:45.110 --> 07:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
power
 
07:59:46.548 --> 07:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
see this is problematic because the
 
07:59:48.310 --> 07:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
language change may undermine the
 
07:59:50.468 --> 07:59:50.478 align:start position:0%
state's right to bring a lawsuit there
 
07:59:51.990 --> 07:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
is if there's no mandate for new
 
07:59:53.670 --> 07:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire to defend its student
 
07:59:53.680 --> 07:59:55.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire to defend its student
sovereignty

07:59:55.750 --> 07:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
sovereignty
 
07:59:56.868 --> 07:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
we never heard from the attorney
 
07:59:58.948 --> 07:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
general's office as to why the suggested
 
08:00:01.350 --> 08:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
language change to permissive was so
 
08:00:03.590 --> 08:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
important so we're left with answered
 
08:00:05.830 --> 08:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions
 
08:00:08.628 --> 08:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know does this undermine
 
08:00:10.548 --> 08:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
the position that we're intending to to
 
08:00:14.868 --> 08:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:16.788 --> 08:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
so second the bill also creates this
 
08:00:19.270 --> 08:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
problematic double taxation standard in
 
08:00:20.948 --> 08:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
one paragraph it stands for the
 
08:00:23.030 --> 08:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
principle that no other state may tax
 
08:00:24.948 --> 08:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens who work remotely
 
08:00:26.230 --> 08:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
08:00:28.868 --> 08:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
but then in another paragraph reaffirms
 
08:00:30.788 --> 08:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's right to tax another
 
08:00:33.030 --> 08:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
state's citizens located outside of new
 
08:00:34.708 --> 08:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire through our business profits
 
08:00:36.948 --> 08:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
and enterprises taxes
 
08:00:38.788 --> 08:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
the logical incongruency here of the
 
08:00:40.150 --> 08:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
double tax
 
08:00:42.468 --> 08:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
double standard and taxation cannot be
 
08:00:42.478 --> 08:00:44.150 align:start position:0%
double standard and taxation cannot be
ignored

08:00:44.150 --> 08:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
08:00:46.310 --> 08:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
and we also have to remember the state's
 
08:00:49.030 --> 08:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
shift to single sales factor taxation
 
08:00:52.070 --> 08:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
and determining those big business taxes
 
08:00:53.590 --> 08:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
you've got to wonder is this bill
 
08:00:55.430 --> 08:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
intention unintentionally harming our
 
08:00:57.830 --> 08:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
position by setting up our state to lose
 
08:00:59.750 --> 08:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
significant portion of its revenue
 
08:00:59.760 --> 08:01:01.910 align:start position:0%
significant portion of its revenue
stream

08:01:01.910 --> 08:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
stream
 
08:01:04.548 --> 08:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
this body has a responsibility
 
08:01:06.150 --> 08:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
to be prudent
 
08:01:09.190 --> 08:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
to be patient and to properly study the
 
08:01:10.548 --> 08:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
issue before us
 
08:01:12.468 --> 08:01:12.478 align:start position:0%
there are simply too many unanswered
 
08:01:14.468 --> 08:01:14.478 align:start position:0%
questions too many unknowns and too many
 
08:01:16.310 --> 08:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
risks to support this legislation as
 
08:01:18.388 --> 08:01:18.398 align:start position:0%
written for these reasons i urge my
 
08:01:19.990 --> 08:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote no on the motion for
 
08:01:23.670 --> 08:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment on hb 1097
 
08:01:25.670 --> 08:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
so that another motion may be put forth
 
08:01:27.670 --> 08:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and happy st
 
08:01:32.310 --> 08:01:32.320 align:start position:0%

08:01:35.110 --> 08:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry is recognized
 
08:01:36.388 --> 08:01:36.398 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of the committee
 
08:01:36.398 --> 08:01:41.190 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of the committee
report

08:01:41.190 --> 08:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:44.468 --> 08:01:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:48.468 --> 08:01:48.478 align:start position:0%
i make my maiden voyage to the well
 
08:01:52.948 --> 08:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
to urge your support of hb 1097.
 
08:01:54.548 --> 08:01:54.558 align:start position:0%
which has the
 
08:01:58.310 --> 08:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support of a 17-6 majority
 
08:02:02.230 --> 08:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:04.310 --> 08:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
i think everybody is generally familiar
 
08:02:06.868 --> 08:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
with the background so i won't labor it
 
08:02:08.708 --> 08:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
but we know that during the pandemic
 
08:02:11.430 --> 08:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts asserted a taxation power
 
08:02:14.070 --> 08:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't expect
 
08:02:15.910 --> 08:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
claiming that
 
08:02:17.990 --> 08:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
08:02:20.150 --> 08:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
while staying home and working
 
08:02:22.310 --> 08:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
exclusively in new hampshire
 
08:02:24.628 --> 08:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
would be subjected to massachusetts
 
08:02:28.788 --> 08:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
personal income tax and withholding
 
08:02:31.750 --> 08:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
i venture we all had a visceral reaction
 
08:02:33.590 --> 08:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
08:02:33.600 --> 08:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
that that was
illegitimate

08:02:35.750 --> 08:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
illegitimate
 
08:02:37.670 --> 08:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
our governor objected
 
08:02:37.680 --> 08:02:39.190 align:start position:0%
our governor objected
massachusetts

08:02:39.190 --> 08:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
08:02:41.110 --> 08:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
did not yield
 
08:02:44.230 --> 08:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
and the result was our attorney general
 
08:02:46.868 --> 08:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
took a case to the united states supreme
 
08:02:50.468 --> 08:02:50.478 align:start position:0%
court invoking original jurisdiction
 
08:02:52.388 --> 08:02:52.398 align:start position:0%
in which the court can take a case to
 
08:02:55.910 --> 08:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
resolve a conflict between two states
 
08:02:58.310 --> 08:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
but the supreme court declined to take
 
08:03:00.548 --> 08:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
the case
 
08:03:03.510 --> 08:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
there are theories that it's mandatory
 
08:03:06.468 --> 08:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
but when the supreme court chooses not
 
08:03:08.548 --> 08:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
to take a case it's under no obligation
 
08:03:11.030 --> 08:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
to explain why
 
08:03:13.590 --> 08:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
so once left to wonder why
 
08:03:15.750 --> 08:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire is left to wonder
 
08:03:18.150 --> 08:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
exactly how will we repel
 
08:03:20.150 --> 08:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
such an intrusion
 
08:03:22.468 --> 08:03:22.478 align:start position:0%
on our sovereign interests if it arises
 
08:03:24.468 --> 08:03:24.478 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
08:03:27.510 --> 08:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic came unexpectedly
 
08:03:29.590 --> 08:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
the reactions to the pandemic including
 
08:03:32.310 --> 08:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
this massachusetts taxation act
 
08:03:33.830 --> 08:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
were sudden
 
08:03:36.468 --> 08:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
and unanticipated
 
08:03:38.388 --> 08:03:38.398 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility whether it's a
 
08:03:38.398 --> 08:03:40.150 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility whether it's a
pandemic

08:03:40.150 --> 08:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
08:03:42.310 --> 08:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
or shifting
 
08:03:42.320 --> 08:03:43.830 align:start position:0%
or shifting
commuter

08:03:43.830 --> 08:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
commuter
 
08:03:46.070 --> 08:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
and work patterns
 
08:03:48.468 --> 08:03:48.478 align:start position:0%
or high gas prices
 
08:03:50.548 --> 08:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
helping to persuade employers to allow
 
08:03:53.190 --> 08:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
their workers to work from home there is
 
08:03:55.190 --> 08:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
a distinct possibility that this could
 
08:03:58.708 --> 08:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
arise at any time and unfortunately
 
08:04:02.388 --> 08:04:02.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:04.788 --> 08:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
without having been repelled
 
08:04:06.948 --> 08:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
is all too likely to be revoked to be
 
08:04:09.190 --> 08:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
invoked again
 
08:04:11.030 --> 08:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
from any one of our neighbors who all
 
08:04:13.510 --> 08:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
have income taxes
 
08:04:15.590 --> 08:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
and a vested interest in collecting as
 
08:04:18.388 --> 08:04:18.398 align:start position:0%
much as they can
 
08:04:22.310 --> 08:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
so hb 1097 is originally introduced
 
08:04:24.310 --> 08:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
essentially asserted that massachusetts
 
08:04:27.590 --> 08:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
or any other state has no power
 
08:04:29.350 --> 08:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
to tax in this way
 
08:04:31.590 --> 08:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
but we don't have actually the ability
 
08:04:33.510 --> 08:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
to tell another state what their power
 
08:04:36.070 --> 08:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
is what we can do though
 
08:04:37.910 --> 08:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
is we can
 
08:04:41.270 --> 08:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
directly place into law
 
08:04:45.030 --> 08:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
a clear statement of our taxation policy
 
08:04:47.350 --> 08:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
and our sovereign interest
 
08:04:50.310 --> 08:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
and thus arm the attorney general
 
08:04:53.190 --> 08:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
in the case they have to litigate again
 
08:04:57.510 --> 08:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
to establish the basis for standing
 
08:04:58.868 --> 08:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
the likely
 
08:05:01.190 --> 08:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
thinking of the supreme court was
 
08:05:03.190 --> 08:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's the individual taxpayer who's
 
08:05:03.200 --> 08:05:04.468 align:start position:0%
it's the individual taxpayer who's
aggrieved

08:05:04.468 --> 08:05:04.478 align:start position:0%
aggrieved
 
08:05:06.628 --> 08:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
and that taxpayer would have to file a
 
08:05:06.638 --> 08:05:08.230 align:start position:0%
and that taxpayer would have to file a
lawsuit

08:05:08.230 --> 08:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
08:05:08.240 --> 08:05:09.590 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
imagine

08:05:09.590 --> 08:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
08:05:13.030 --> 08:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
you're just a guy trying to bring home
 
08:05:15.750 --> 08:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
his income without massachusetts taking
 
08:05:17.510 --> 08:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
a portion of it and you're going to have
 
08:05:19.270 --> 08:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
to litigate to the united states supreme
 
08:05:19.280 --> 08:05:21.110 align:start position:0%
to litigate to the united states supreme
court

08:05:21.110 --> 08:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
court
 
08:05:23.990 --> 08:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
so in short
 
08:05:26.388 --> 08:05:26.398 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
08:05:28.628 --> 08:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
was co-drafted with attorneys from the
 
08:05:28.638 --> 08:05:30.070 align:start position:0%
was co-drafted with attorneys from the
dra

08:05:30.070 --> 08:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
dra
 
08:05:32.548 --> 08:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
who attended four or five sessions of
 
08:05:34.548 --> 08:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committee
 
08:05:37.270 --> 08:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
and attorneys from the
 
08:05:39.510 --> 08:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
08:05:41.510 --> 08:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
and when the draft was
 
08:05:41.520 --> 08:05:42.868 align:start position:0%
and when the draft was
completed

08:05:42.868 --> 08:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
completed
 
08:05:45.270 --> 08:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
it was placed directly under the eyes of
 
08:05:47.670 --> 08:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general formella
 
08:05:51.990 --> 08:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
who affirmed that he wants this in law
 
08:05:54.468 --> 08:05:54.478 align:start position:0%
so what the minority has basically told
 
08:05:54.478 --> 08:05:56.070 align:start position:0%
so what the minority has basically told
you

08:05:56.070 --> 08:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
08:05:59.670 --> 08:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
is that tax laws complex
 
08:06:01.430 --> 08:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
they think there might be a way to
 
08:06:02.948 --> 08:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
further perfect
 
08:06:02.958 --> 08:06:04.708 align:start position:0%
further perfect
and

08:06:04.708 --> 08:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:06:06.948 --> 08:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
develop a silver bullet
 
08:06:08.788 --> 08:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
but they have yet to tell us what
 
08:06:11.190 --> 08:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
changes they would make
 
08:06:13.030 --> 08:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion
 
08:06:14.310 --> 08:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
08:06:17.430 --> 08:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
embrace hb 1097
 
08:06:18.948 --> 08:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
with the blessing of the attorney
 
08:06:18.958 --> 08:06:20.070 align:start position:0%
with the blessing of the attorney
general

08:06:20.070 --> 08:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
general
 
08:06:22.310 --> 08:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
and if any of us comes up with an even
 
08:06:23.830 --> 08:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
better idea later
 
08:06:25.590 --> 08:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
i am sure the ways and means committee
 
08:06:27.590 --> 08:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
will gladly look at it
 
08:06:29.270 --> 08:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:06:32.468 --> 08:06:32.478 align:start position:0%
does remember yield for a question
 
08:06:37.830 --> 08:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:39.830 --> 08:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
the questions on the majority committee
 
08:06:43.030 --> 08:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
report of ought to pass with amendment
 
08:06:47.430 --> 08:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:48.868 --> 08:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members
 
08:07:13.510 --> 08:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:32.948 --> 08:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:35.190 --> 08:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative you know keller requests
 
08:07:36.788 --> 08:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
a roll call is that sufficiently
 
08:07:36.798 --> 08:07:38.548 align:start position:0%
a roll call is that sufficiently
seconded

08:07:38.548 --> 08:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
seconded
 
08:07:40.948 --> 08:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded now this
 
08:08:01.350 --> 08:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:01.360 --> 08:08:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

08:08:31.030 --> 08:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:31.040 --> 08:08:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

08:08:56.150 --> 08:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:00.070 --> 08:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:01.830 --> 08:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
i also come to order
 
08:09:05.110 --> 08:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
08:09:11.910 --> 08:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:13.750 --> 08:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
you ultimately have control over how
 
08:09:16.948 --> 08:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:19.190 --> 08:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote representative
 
08:09:20.868 --> 08:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
ames is recognized for parliamentary
 
08:09:20.878 --> 08:09:27.990 align:start position:0%

inquiry

08:09:27.990 --> 08:09:28.000 align:start position:0%

08:09:35.030 --> 08:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
if i know that personal income
 
08:09:37.510 --> 08:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
earned by new hampshire residents
 
08:09:40.628 --> 08:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
working entirely within new hampshire
 
08:09:43.430 --> 08:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
should be protected from unfair personal
 
08:09:45.190 --> 08:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
income taxation
 
08:09:47.430 --> 08:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
by other states
 
08:09:47.440 --> 08:09:48.708 align:start position:0%
by other states
but

08:09:48.708 --> 08:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:09:51.270 --> 08:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
if i believe that the proposal contained
 
08:09:54.070 --> 08:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
in hb 1097
 
08:09:55.910 --> 08:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
that is intended to protect new
 
08:09:58.788 --> 08:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire workers from such interstate
 
08:09:58.798 --> 08:10:00.468 align:start position:0%
hampshire workers from such interstate
taxation

taxation
 
08:10:00.478 --> 08:10:01.590 align:start position:0%

withholding
 
08:11:03.670 --> 08:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the committee
 
08:11:06.230 --> 08:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
believes that this bill addresses a very
 
08:11:07.830 --> 08:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
08:11:10.150 --> 08:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
that was offensive to new hampshire
 
08:11:12.868 --> 08:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
independent sovereignty and that this
 
08:11:14.868 --> 08:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
issue must be addressed
 
08:11:14.878 --> 08:11:16.310 align:start position:0%

arise again without recourse
 
08:11:23.110 --> 08:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
and if i know the committee concluded
 
08:11:25.670 --> 08:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
that the bill needed to be reframed
 
08:11:27.510 --> 08:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
so in connection with the attorney
 
08:11:27.520 --> 08:11:28.708 align:start position:0%

08:11:34.708 --> 08:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
re-aim the bill
 
08:11:38.070 --> 08:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
towards firmly and inequality
 
08:11:41.110 --> 08:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
establishing an explicit claim of policy
 
08:11:43.030 --> 08:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
and sovereign interest
 
08:11:45.910 --> 08:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
that will put other states on notice
 
08:11:48.310 --> 08:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
and clearly lay the foundation
 
08:11:50.708 --> 08:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
for successful litigation if it should
 
08:11:53.110 --> 08:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
ever become necessary

08:19:55.190 --> 08:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
provides tax relief for both the
 
08:19:57.510 --> 08:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
08:20:00.788 --> 08:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
and the business profits tax
 
08:20:03.750 --> 08:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
but that the committee amendment
 
08:20:06.150 --> 08:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
would only reduce the business profits
 
08:20:06.160 --> 08:20:07.750 align:start position:0%
would only reduce the business profits
tax

08:20:07.750 --> 08:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
tax
 
08:20:09.670 --> 08:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker
 
08:20:11.270 --> 08:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
if i also know
 
08:20:13.830 --> 08:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
that the business profits tax
 
08:20:17.350 --> 08:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
is mostly paid by larger companies
 
08:20:19.350 --> 08:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
while smaller businesses
 
08:20:21.510 --> 08:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
are much more likely to pay just the
 
08:20:24.468 --> 08:20:24.478 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
08:20:26.230 --> 08:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker
 
08:20:28.788 --> 08:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
if i further know
 
08:20:30.948 --> 08:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
that the small businesses were much more
 
08:20:33.590 --> 08:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
likely to be negatively impacted during
 
08:20:35.270 --> 08:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
08:20:37.670 --> 08:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
and they are at
 
08:20:40.230 --> 08:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
they are at least as deserving if not
 
08:20:42.948 --> 08:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
more deserving as larger businesses to
 
08:20:42.958 --> 08:20:43.830 align:start position:0%
more deserving as larger businesses to

tax relief
 
08:20:49.510 --> 08:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
08:20:52.468 --> 08:20:52.478 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire new hampshire has
 
08:20:55.190 --> 08:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
had several other rounds of business
 
08:20:55.200 --> 08:20:57.430 align:start position:0%
had several other rounds of business
relief

08:20:57.430 --> 08:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
relief
 
08:20:59.590 --> 08:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the past seven years
 
08:21:01.670 --> 08:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
and despite assertions that these cuts
 
08:21:03.910 --> 08:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
would undermine our business tax and
 
08:21:03.920 --> 08:21:05.430 align:start position:0%
would undermine our business tax and
revenues

08:21:05.430 --> 08:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
08:21:07.910 --> 08:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
our business taxes for this fiscal year
 
08:21:10.070 --> 08:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
are currently more than 88 percent
 
08:21:12.230 --> 08:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
higher than they were
 
08:21:15.830 --> 08:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
the final year at the highest rates
 
08:21:18.070 --> 08:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
finally mr speaker
 
08:21:20.708 --> 08:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
if i know that this fiscal year alone
 
08:21:23.030 --> 08:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
through just eight months
 
08:21:24.788 --> 08:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
our business taxes
 
08:21:27.270 --> 08:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
are already more than 91 million dollars
 
08:21:28.628 --> 08:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan
 
08:21:31.510 --> 08:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
and overall revenues are more than 191
 
08:21:33.510 --> 08:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars over plan
 
08:21:36.150 --> 08:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
so we can clearly afford to give relief
 
08:21:38.388 --> 08:21:38.398 align:start position:0%
for bet and b
 
08:21:38.398 --> 08:21:39.670 align:start position:0%
for bet and b
pt

08:21:39.670 --> 08:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
pt
 
08:21:39.680 --> 08:21:40.468 align:start position:0%
pt
then

08:21:40.468 --> 08:21:40.478 align:start position:0%
then
 
08:21:43.830 --> 08:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
what i now press the red button
 
08:21:46.628 --> 08:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
so that we can provide tax relief to all
 
08:21:48.948 --> 08:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
businesses this this is a parliamentary
 
08:21:48.958 --> 08:21:50.308 align:start position:0%
businesses this this is a parliamentary
inquiry

08:21:50.308 --> 08:21:50.318 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
08:21:53.830 --> 08:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
then would i press the red button
 
08:21:56.468 --> 08:21:56.478 align:start position:0%
so that we can provide
 
08:21:58.948 --> 08:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
tax relief to all businesses so that we
 
08:22:00.788 --> 08:22:00.798 align:start position:0%

08:22:19.110 --> 08:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:22:21.510 --> 08:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
08:22:21.520 --> 08:22:22.468 align:start position:0%
if i know
that

08:22:22.468 --> 08:22:22.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:22:24.948 --> 08:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
this bill originally
 
08:22:28.150 --> 08:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
was to reduce the business profits tax
 
08:22:30.628 --> 08:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
and the business enterprise tax
 
08:22:32.948 --> 08:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
and it would reduce income by a total of
 
08:22:35.590 --> 08:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
36 million dollars
 
08:22:36.830 --> 08:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
also if i
 
08:22:38.788 --> 08:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
know that
 
08:22:39.990 --> 08:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
08:22:40.000 --> 08:22:41.270 align:start position:0%
we have
instituted

08:22:41.270 --> 08:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
instituted
 
08:22:43.430 --> 08:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
through house bill 2 last year and
 
08:22:43.440 --> 08:22:44.868 align:start position:0%
through house bill 2 last year and
others

08:22:44.868 --> 08:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
others
 
08:22:46.628 --> 08:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
a reduction in the business and the
 
08:22:49.430 --> 08:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
price tax business profits tax meals and
 
08:22:51.030 --> 08:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
rooms tax
 
08:22:53.510 --> 08:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
and they're going to glide down to zero
 
08:22:56.070 --> 08:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
on the interest and dividend tax
 
08:22:58.468 --> 08:22:58.478 align:start position:0%
and we also raise the threshold for
 
08:23:01.110 --> 08:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
filing the business enterprise tax
 
08:23:03.430 --> 08:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
raise the threshold for filing the
 
08:23:04.708 --> 08:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
business tax
 
08:23:08.468 --> 08:23:08.478 align:start position:0%
and if i know that yes our
 
08:23:11.430 --> 08:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
business taxes are high
 
08:23:13.910 --> 08:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's two major reasons for that if i
 
08:23:13.920 --> 08:23:14.708 align:start position:0%
there's two major reasons for that if i
know

08:23:14.708 --> 08:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
08:23:17.510 --> 08:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're high because
 
08:23:19.270 --> 08:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't change the
 
08:23:22.308 --> 08:23:22.318 align:start position:0%
tax laws for ppp loans
 
08:23:23.670 --> 08:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
08:23:26.788 --> 08:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
the businesses had to pay taxes on those
 
08:23:28.628 --> 08:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be about 100 million
 
08:23:31.430 --> 08:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
dollars is going to have to be refunded
 
08:23:33.510 --> 08:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i also know
 
08:23:35.030 --> 08:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
that there's been a
 
08:23:37.670 --> 08:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
number of stimuluses over the last
 
08:23:38.540 --> 08:23:38.550 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
08:23:38.550 --> 08:23:39.670 align:start position:0%
couple of years

now
 
08:23:55.830 --> 08:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
that raises our profits and you we're
 
08:23:57.670 --> 08:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
seeing that now
 
08:23:59.510 --> 08:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
those are one-time things
 
08:24:02.388 --> 08:24:02.398 align:start position:0%
if the member will suspend this is a
 
08:24:04.230 --> 08:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
08:24:06.788 --> 08:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
okay if i know that that raises our
 
08:24:09.510 --> 08:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
profits and this is a one-time
 
08:24:09.520 --> 08:24:11.590 align:start position:0%
profits and this is a one-time
event

08:24:11.590 --> 08:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
event
 
08:24:13.830 --> 08:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that this amendment
 
08:24:13.840 --> 08:24:15.190 align:start position:0%
and that this amendment
reduces

08:24:15.190 --> 08:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
reduces
 
08:24:17.030 --> 08:24:17.040 align:start position:0%

something was said

that would indicate
 
08:27:31.190 --> 08:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
that the chair of ways and means

would be more likely
 
08:27:33.920 --> 08:27:35.350 align:start position:0%
would be more likely
to

08:27:35.350 --> 08:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
to

this body
 
08:27:50.788 --> 08:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
who is more honorable than the chair of
 
08:27:53.510 --> 08:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
wasteland if you were recognized for a
 
08:27:57.990 --> 08:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
question and my question is how do we
 
08:28:04.868 --> 08:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:28:07.270 --> 08:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
once once again representative i'm going
 
08:28:13.510 --> 08:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:28:16.070 --> 08:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us now is the majority

and consumers alike

08:34:47.510 --> 08:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
cuts given mostly to our largest

businesses over the last six years
 
08:34:52.230 --> 08:34:52.240 align:start position:0%

and as new recession threatens our
 
08:34:59.510 --> 08:34:59.520 align:start position:0%

08:35:10.788 --> 08:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
is mindless and senseless i hope that
 
08:35:13.270 --> 08:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
you will agree and join me in voting

08:35:35.670 --> 08:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded
 
08:35:37.670 --> 08:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
08:35:39.270 --> 08:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
will take your seats where you're on the

08:36:02.468 --> 08:36:02.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:36:05.270 --> 08:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker as several speakers before me
 
08:36:06.308 --> 08:36:06.318 align:start position:0%
have now
 
08:36:10.468 --> 08:36:10.478 align:start position:0%
announced the original hb 1221 proposed
 
08:36:12.468 --> 08:36:12.478 align:start position:0%
to cut the business enterprise tax and
 
08:36:14.628 --> 08:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax we all know
 
08:36:16.948 --> 08:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
that now it's been said more than once
 
08:36:18.788 --> 08:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just voted on and
 
08:36:20.628 --> 08:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
approved is only going to lower the
 
08:36:22.788 --> 08:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
business profits tax so the
 
08:36:25.030 --> 08:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
so any revenue hit to the state
 
08:36:27.590 --> 08:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
is very minimal it's it's estimated to
 
08:36:29.670 --> 08:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
be eight million dollars but the thing
 
08:36:32.070 --> 08:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
that we have seen is every time we have
 
08:36:33.750 --> 08:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
cut taxes
 
08:36:36.308 --> 08:36:36.318 align:start position:0%
we've seen an increase in tax revenue
 
08:36:38.388 --> 08:36:38.398 align:start position:0%
so who knows the eight million may
 
08:36:40.388 --> 08:36:40.398 align:start position:0%
it may actually be zero
 
08:36:40.398 --> 08:36:41.350 align:start position:0%
it may actually be zero
um

08:36:41.350 --> 08:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:36:46.388 --> 08:36:46.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:36:48.150 --> 08:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
the um
 
08:36:50.308 --> 08:36:50.318 align:start position:0%
many taxes were lowered in previous
 
08:36:50.318 --> 08:36:51.190 align:start position:0%
many taxes were lowered in previous
years

08:36:51.190 --> 08:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
08:36:52.948 --> 08:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
and so one of the that was one of the
 
08:36:55.030 --> 08:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
reasons as representative major
 
08:36:58.388 --> 08:36:58.398 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we focus just on the bpt
 
08:37:00.308 --> 08:37:00.318 align:start position:0%
right now is because we want things to
 
08:37:03.510 --> 08:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
settle down we want to see how the ppp
 
08:37:05.750 --> 08:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh loans and the coveted relief funds
 
08:37:08.468 --> 08:37:08.478 align:start position:0%
affect the tax in the end
 
08:37:10.948 --> 08:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
now some will say and some have already
 
08:37:10.958 --> 08:37:11.910 align:start position:0%
now some will say and some have already
said

08:37:11.910 --> 08:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
said
 
08:37:13.990 --> 08:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
that big business is going to profit
 
08:37:17.430 --> 08:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
from this i i disagree with that basic
 
08:37:19.910 --> 08:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
assertion there are a lot of small
 
08:37:22.070 --> 08:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
businesses that are paying the business
 
08:37:24.548 --> 08:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
profits tax and not paying the business
 
08:37:26.150 --> 08:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax
 
08:37:28.628 --> 08:37:28.638 align:start position:0%
both those uh thresholds were increased
 
08:37:31.030 --> 08:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax threshold and
 
08:37:33.190 --> 08:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
the business enterprise tax threshold
 
08:37:35.670 --> 08:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
have both both been raised and that's
 
08:37:37.510 --> 08:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
helping small business
 
08:37:40.308 --> 08:37:40.318 align:start position:0%
and i i beg to differ even a 0.1 percent
 
08:37:43.910 --> 08:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
decrease helps business
 
08:37:43.920 --> 08:37:45.910 align:start position:0%
decrease helps business
furthermore

08:37:45.910 --> 08:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
08:37:48.150 --> 08:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
when we think about those who are
 
08:37:50.308 --> 08:37:50.318 align:start position:0%
thinking about coming to new hampshire
 
08:37:51.670 --> 08:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
and bringing their business to new
 
08:37:51.680 --> 08:37:52.628 align:start position:0%
and bringing their business to new
hampshire

08:37:52.628 --> 08:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:37:54.308 --> 08:37:54.318 align:start position:0%
and those who are in new hampshire that
 
08:37:56.868 --> 08:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
want to we want them to stay here
 
08:38:00.308 --> 08:38:00.318 align:start position:0%
every point one matters
 
08:38:03.910 --> 08:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
now we compare very favorably to the
 
08:38:06.388 --> 08:38:06.398 align:start position:0%
other states massachusetts is at eight
 
08:38:06.398 --> 08:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
other states massachusetts is at eight
percent

08:38:07.670 --> 08:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
08:38:10.788 --> 08:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
so they'd compare with our 7.5 vermont
 
08:38:14.150 --> 08:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
is at 8.5 percent as soon as you net
 
08:38:16.468 --> 08:38:16.478 align:start position:0%
more than 25 dollars
 
08:38:17.910 --> 08:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna venture to say there's a lot
 
08:38:19.270 --> 08:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
of businesses that make more than twenty
 
08:38:20.628 --> 08:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
five thousand
 
08:38:20.638 --> 08:38:21.670 align:start position:0%
five thousand
so

08:38:21.670 --> 08:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:38:22.948 --> 08:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
in the end
 
08:38:24.548 --> 08:38:24.558 align:start position:0%
this tax reduction will be good for new
 
08:38:26.150 --> 08:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
 
08:38:27.910 --> 08:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
good for this state

as the chair
 
08:39:26.628 --> 08:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
as our chair said
 
08:39:26.638 --> 08:39:27.750 align:start position:0%
as our chair said
earlier

08:39:27.750 --> 08:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
08:39:30.150 --> 08:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
that there have been major changes to
 
08:39:31.750 --> 08:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
our tax rates
 
08:39:35.430 --> 08:39:35.440 align:start position:0%

as well as unforeseeable blows
 
08:39:41.840 --> 08:39:43.270 align:start position:0%
as well as unforeseeable blows
and

08:39:43.270 --> 08:39:43.280 align:start position:0%

one-time federal supports to our economy
 
08:39:49.670 --> 08:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
08:39:49.680 --> 08:39:50.628 align:start position:0%
and if i know
that

08:39:50.628 --> 08:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:39:52.628 --> 08:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
08:39:55.110 --> 08:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
which businesses as well as residents
 
08:39:56.628 --> 08:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
08:39:59.590 --> 08:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
rise even faster when the state deficits
 
08:40:03.190 --> 08:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
cause shortfalls in municipal or school
 
08:40:03.200 --> 08:40:03.990 align:start position:0%

08:40:09.830 --> 08:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know that our committee finds
 
08:40:12.548 --> 08:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
it exceedingly difficult to forecast
 
08:40:15.670 --> 08:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
whether we will find ourselves next year
 
08:40:18.150 --> 08:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
maybe even the end of this year
 
08:40:19.350 --> 08:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
or in
 
08:40:22.628 --> 08:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
several years to come in deficit or in
 
08:40:22.638 --> 08:40:24.308 align:start position:0%
several years to come in deficit or in
surplus

08:40:24.308 --> 08:40:24.318 align:start position:0%
surplus
 
08:40:26.788 --> 08:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
and finally if i believe that it is
 
08:40:30.230 --> 08:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
foolhardy to make this further totally
 
08:40:30.240 --> 08:40:31.670 align:start position:0%

if i know this bill originally proposed
 
08:41:02.868 --> 08:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
lowering the business profits tax and

the business enterprise tax

08:41:09.430 --> 08:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenues
 
08:41:11.590 --> 08:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know the bill was amended to
 
08:41:12.868 --> 08:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
only lower
 
08:41:15.830 --> 08:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax from 7.6
 
08:41:18.548 --> 08:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
percent to 7.5 percent
 
08:41:20.548 --> 08:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
which will lower the business taxes
 
08:41:23.510 --> 08:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
approximately eight million dollars
 
08:41:26.468 --> 08:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
and if i know this reduction in the b
 
08:41:29.510 --> 08:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
business profits tax rate will be good
 
08:41:32.150 --> 08:41:32.160 align:start position:0%

uh if i know that hb 1071 asks boaters
 
08:45:35.270 --> 08:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
to maintain a 250 clearance from shore
 
08:45:38.070 --> 08:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
docks and other vessels vessels
 
08:45:40.548 --> 08:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
only when wake surfing
 
08:45:42.868 --> 08:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
in order to moderate the effects of
 
08:45:45.590 --> 08:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
their powerful waves and wakes
 
08:45:49.030 --> 08:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
on other boats boaters bathers and the
 
08:45:49.040 --> 08:45:50.468 align:start position:0%
on other boats boaters bathers and the
shoreline

08:45:50.468 --> 08:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
shoreline
 
08:45:52.548 --> 08:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
and if i know the captain of marine

patrol
 
08:45:56.788 --> 08:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
stated this 100 foot increase is
 
08:46:00.628 --> 08:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
unlikely to preclude wake surfing on any
 
08:46:02.948 --> 08:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
water body in new hampshire
 
08:46:05.190 --> 08:46:05.200 align:start position:0%

agreed

08:46:07.628 --> 08:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
08:46:11.510 --> 08:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
250 feet is a distance that will protect
 
08:46:14.788 --> 08:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
the environment while allowing a very
 
08:46:17.590 --> 08:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
popular sport to continue
 
08:46:19.910 --> 08:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
and if i know that lake and river
 
08:46:19.920 --> 08:46:21.430 align:start position:0%
and if i know that lake and river
associations

08:46:21.430 --> 08:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
associations
 
08:46:25.670 --> 08:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
advocate 300 and to 500 feet clearance
 
08:46:27.990 --> 08:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
then would i agree
 
08:46:32.868 --> 08:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
that hb 1071 is a modest proposal that
 
08:46:34.750 --> 08:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
hits the sweet spot
 
08:46:36.708 --> 08:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
250 feet
 
08:46:39.190 --> 08:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
between what the wake surfing community
 
08:46:43.030 --> 08:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
wants education enforcement and no
 
08:46:43.040 --> 08:46:44.070 align:start position:0%

change

08:46:44.070 --> 08:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
change
 
08:46:47.030 --> 08:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
and what the concerned public wants the
 
08:46:49.910 --> 08:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for everyone to enjoy their
 
08:46:51.750 --> 08:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
lake experiences

now and into the future and if i know
 
08:46:57.670 --> 08:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
all this i would push the red button to
 
08:47:00.708 --> 08:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
overturn the itl and allow another
 
08:47:02.788 --> 08:47:02.798 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
08:47:13.110 --> 08:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
if i know that new hampshire boating

laws and coast guard regulations
 
08:47:17.350 --> 08:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
currently require boaters to be

responsible for their own wake
 
08:47:22.548 --> 08:47:22.558 align:start position:0%

fines

08:47:23.750 --> 08:47:23.760 align:start position:0%

bill
 
10:06:39.190 --> 10:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
would increase electricity costs at a
 
10:06:40.790 --> 10:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
time when we don't want to see
 
10:06:43.266 --> 10:06:43.276 align:start position:0%
electricity costs go any go up any more
 
10:06:46.230 --> 10:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
10:06:48.310 --> 10:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
and in addition mr speaker if i know
 
10:06:50.070 --> 10:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
that very few people expressed an
 
10:06:51.670 --> 10:06:51.680 align:start position:0%

would i now press the green button to

10:07:00.630 --> 10:07:00.640 align:start position:0%

christian for a parliamentary inquiry

thank you mr chair
 
10:07:06.790 --> 10:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill will help
 
10:07:08.870 --> 10:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
individuals and small businesses with
 
10:07:11.190 --> 10:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
multiple electricity meters who generate
 
10:07:13.586 --> 10:07:13.596 align:start position:0%
their own energy to budget and avoid
 
10:07:15.990 --> 10:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
taking on unnecessary debt by allowing
 
10:07:17.746 --> 10:07:17.756 align:start position:0%
them to apply the credit generated on
 
10:07:20.790 --> 10:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
one meter to the bill on another meter
 
10:07:22.710 --> 10:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
and if i know that utilities already
 
10:07:24.790 --> 10:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
administer these credits manually once a
 
10:07:26.390 --> 10:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
year meaning that this should not
 
10:07:28.390 --> 10:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
require substantial additional costs or
 
10:07:28.400 --> 10:07:30.150 align:start position:0%
require substantial additional costs or
complexity

10:07:30.150 --> 10:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
10:07:31.906 --> 10:07:31.916 align:start position:0%
and further if i know that allowing a
 
10:07:33.746 --> 10:07:33.756 align:start position:0%
utility to hold and collect interest
 
10:07:36.070 --> 10:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
from funds for a period of up to 11
 
10:07:39.266 --> 10:07:39.276 align:start position:0%
months that have already been earned by
 
10:07:42.070 --> 10:07:42.080 align:start position:0%

10:07:42.080 --> 10:07:43.266 align:start position:0%
and properly
sorry

10:07:43.266 --> 10:07:43.276 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
10:07:45.350 --> 10:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
and should be paid to granite staters is
 
10:07:47.190 --> 10:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
an illegal taking of funds that properly
 
10:07:49.350 --> 10:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
belong to the customer generators would
 
10:07:50.790 --> 10:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
i now press the red button so that
 
10:07:53.510 --> 10:07:53.520 align:start position:0%

state your motion
 
10:10:18.870 --> 10:10:18.880 align:start position:0%

hb 1148
 
10:11:05.110 --> 10:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh if you if you heard the description
 
10:11:07.586 --> 10:11:07.596 align:start position:0%
relative to prohibiting governmental
 
10:11:07.596 --> 10:11:08.390 align:start position:0%
relative to prohibiting governmental
entities

10:11:08.390 --> 10:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
entities
 
10:11:11.746 --> 10:11:11.756 align:start position:0%
subordinate to the state blah blah blah
 
10:11:13.746 --> 10:11:13.756 align:start position:0%
what it really boils down to
 
10:11:15.266 --> 10:11:15.276 align:start position:0%
is saying that
 
10:11:18.070 --> 10:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
local towns and cities
 
10:11:20.710 --> 10:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
are unable to determine whether there
 
10:11:23.426 --> 10:11:23.436 align:start position:0%
are certain fuel types that will not be
 
10:11:25.746 --> 10:11:25.756 align:start position:0%
used within their borders
 
10:11:28.150 --> 10:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
so the minority finds this to be an
 
10:11:30.230 --> 10:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
extremely disruptive bill to new
 
10:11:32.630 --> 10:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire energy planning
 
10:11:35.990 --> 10:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
hb 1148 not only removes local control
 
10:11:38.150 --> 10:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
for energy planning from those who are
 
10:11:40.630 --> 10:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
doing the work on town energy committees
 
10:11:42.470 --> 10:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
to help lower costs
 
10:11:44.630 --> 10:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
and emissions
 
10:11:47.350 --> 10:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
it voids decisions already made
 
10:11:48.870 --> 10:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
by towns
 
10:11:51.266 --> 10:11:51.276 align:start position:0%
who have adopted plans to eliminate
 
10:11:53.350 --> 10:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels from their municipal energy
 
10:11:56.230 --> 10:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
portfolios because the bill is also
 
10:11:56.240 --> 10:11:58.150 align:start position:0%
portfolios because the bill is also
retroactive

10:11:58.150 --> 10:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
retroactive
 
10:12:00.390 --> 10:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is an about face
 
10:12:02.390 --> 10:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
in direction setting that walks back
 
10:12:05.586 --> 10:12:05.596 align:start position:0%
support for local clean energy efforts
 
10:12:08.150 --> 10:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
to implement a mandate that says new
 
10:12:10.550 --> 10:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire counties and towns have no
 
10:12:13.586 --> 10:12:13.596 align:start position:0%
authority to exclude an energy source
 
10:12:15.350 --> 10:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
can only be seen as paving the way for
 
10:12:18.230 --> 10:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
continued fossil fuel dependence
 
10:12:20.470 --> 10:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is not the desire of many towns who
 
10:12:22.950 --> 10:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
have already invested in moving forward
 
10:12:24.790 --> 10:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
with clean energy targets and i know
 
10:12:26.950 --> 10:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
because i live in one of those towns in
 
10:12:29.906 --> 10:12:29.916 align:start position:0%
my town hollis over eight years ago
 
10:12:31.746 --> 10:12:31.756 align:start position:0%
we did a benchmarking study of all our
 
10:12:34.150 --> 10:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings and then we began
 
10:12:36.310 --> 10:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
investing in converting maybe some of
 
10:12:38.390 --> 10:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
you have had the same experience some of
 
10:12:41.990 --> 10:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
your town buildings to pellet burners
 
10:12:44.470 --> 10:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
we put solar panels on top of the
 
10:12:46.790 --> 10:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
elementary schools and all of these have
 
10:12:49.426 --> 10:12:49.436 align:start position:0%
resulted in hundreds of thousands a year
 
10:12:51.670 --> 10:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
of dollars going down in our energy
 
10:12:52.870 --> 10:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
costs so
 
10:12:55.586 --> 10:12:55.596 align:start position:0%
we believe the minority believes
 
10:12:57.190 --> 10:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
we should have the right to do that we
 
10:12:59.266 --> 10:12:59.276 align:start position:0%
should have the right to lower our costs
 
10:13:02.230 --> 10:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
and invest in which sources we want and
 
10:13:04.070 --> 10:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
if we want to set a target saying we
 
10:13:06.630 --> 10:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
will be fossil fuel free by 2050 which
 
10:13:08.790 --> 10:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
many towns in new hampshire already have
 
10:13:10.870 --> 10:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
we should be free to do that this bill
 
10:13:12.550 --> 10:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
would prohibit that
 
10:13:15.266 --> 10:13:15.276 align:start position:0%
so um this
 
10:13:17.510 --> 10:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is very much an issue of granite
 
10:13:19.190 --> 10:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
staters having greater control over
 
10:13:21.586 --> 10:13:21.596 align:start position:0%
their energy bills which we talk often
 
10:13:24.390 --> 10:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
is something we want uh creating savings
 
10:13:27.350 --> 10:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
through local generation hb 1148
 
10:13:29.670 --> 10:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
disrupts orderly planning for many
 
10:13:31.906 --> 10:13:31.916 align:start position:0%
municipalities and defies our
 
10:13:33.426 --> 10:13:33.436 align:start position:0%
long-standing tradition for local
 
10:13:36.150 --> 10:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
control please oppose the ought to pass
 
10:13:39.906 --> 10:13:39.916 align:start position:0%
 
10:13:43.110 --> 10:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative platt
 
10:13:45.746 --> 10:13:45.756 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and i thank the
 
10:13:47.510 --> 10:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues who came back
 
10:13:49.670 --> 10:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
from dinner tonight and i know you did
 
10:13:51.190 --> 10:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
it just to listen to my scintillating
 
10:13:51.200 --> 10:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
it just to listen to my scintillating
speech

10:13:55.110 --> 10:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
10:13:56.630 --> 10:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
10:13:58.070 --> 10:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
first of all has nothing to do with
 
10:13:59.746 --> 10:13:59.756 align:start position:0%
heating systems it was a senate bill
 
10:14:01.990 --> 10:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
last year which which uh
 
10:14:03.746 --> 10:14:03.756 align:start position:0%
stopped municipalities from uh
 
10:14:05.426 --> 10:14:05.436 align:start position:0%
prohibiting any kind of heating system
 
10:14:08.070 --> 10:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
this is power production or conversion
 
10:14:11.110 --> 10:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
and contrary to the minority speaker it
 
10:14:12.870 --> 10:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't block a municipality from
 
10:14:14.950 --> 10:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
investing their own money and solar what
 
10:14:16.790 --> 10:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
it does do is keep them
 
10:14:16.800 --> 10:14:17.670 align:start position:0%
it does do is keep them
from

10:14:17.670 --> 10:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
10:14:17.680 --> 10:14:18.950 align:start position:0%
from
prohibiting

10:14:18.950 --> 10:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
prohibiting
 
10:14:21.586 --> 10:14:21.596 align:start position:0%
generation of any sort or throwing
 
10:14:23.990 --> 10:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances in the way of them changing
 
10:14:24.000 --> 10:14:25.586 align:start position:0%
ordinances in the way of them changing
zoning

10:14:25.586 --> 10:14:25.596 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
10:14:27.426 --> 10:14:27.436 align:start position:0%
power production has to follow local
 
10:14:29.110 --> 10:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
zoning unless accepted by the site
 
10:14:31.350 --> 10:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee but
 
10:14:33.266 --> 10:14:33.276 align:start position:0%
but the ordinance that the town or
 
10:14:36.390 --> 10:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
municipality cannot change zoning to
 
10:14:39.110 --> 10:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
throw roadblocks in the way of
 
10:14:39.120 --> 10:14:40.310 align:start position:0%
throw roadblocks in the way of
production

10:14:40.310 --> 10:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
production
 
10:14:42.630 --> 10:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
so this is a state responsibility before
 
10:14:45.190 --> 10:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee any kind
 
10:14:45.200 --> 10:14:46.550 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee any kind
of

10:14:46.550 --> 10:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
10:14:48.550 --> 10:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
generation that's proposed
 
10:14:50.710 --> 10:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
is an automatic opposition from a lot of
 
10:14:52.630 --> 10:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
people no matter what it is it's not in
 
10:14:53.990 --> 10:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
my backyard
 
10:14:55.990 --> 10:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh or or it's uh
 
10:14:58.470 --> 10:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
ideologically driven but it is an
 
10:15:01.266 --> 10:15:01.276 align:start position:0%
automatic negative reaction some cases
 
10:15:03.426 --> 10:15:03.436 align:start position:0%
is positive site evaluation committee
 
10:15:05.266 --> 10:15:05.276 align:start position:0%
the municipality can go there and argue
 
10:15:07.030 --> 10:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
for pro or con but it should be at the
 
10:15:08.950 --> 10:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee
 
10:15:15.350 --> 10:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
10:15:18.150 --> 10:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
the motion before us on house bill 1148
 
10:15:21.586 --> 10:15:21.596 align:start position:0%
is a majority report about to pass
 
10:15:23.990 --> 10:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
10:15:25.510 --> 10:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
will take their seats this will be a
 
10:15:40.550 --> 10:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
10:15:42.230 --> 10:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting for everybody to
 
10:15:44.470 --> 10:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
take a seat
 
10:15:46.870 --> 10:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
i would remind members
 
10:15:46.880 --> 10:15:48.870 align:start position:0%
i would remind members
that

10:15:48.870 --> 10:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
10:15:51.350 --> 10:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiries
 
10:15:54.150 --> 10:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be short
 
10:15:56.150 --> 10:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
and to the point
 
10:16:04.870 --> 10:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
10:16:08.230 --> 10:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
we actually we have a form up here
 
10:16:09.906 --> 10:16:09.916 align:start position:0%
to tell everyone how to do a
 
10:16:11.830 --> 10:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
10:16:14.470 --> 10:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're getting way too long
 
10:16:16.150 --> 10:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
and way too involved in what a
 
10:16:18.550 --> 10:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry is supposed to be
 
10:16:20.390 --> 10:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm addressing it to both sides of
 
10:16:28.950 --> 10:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
10:16:30.710 --> 10:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
the question before us is a majority
 
10:16:33.110 --> 10:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
report of ought to pass on house bill
 
10:16:35.990 --> 10:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
1148 this is a division vote the chair
 
10:16:38.310 --> 10:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative mcgee for a
 
10:16:41.830 --> 10:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
10:16:43.426 --> 10:16:43.436 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
10:16:44.390 --> 10:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
10:16:46.550 --> 10:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
that prohibiting cities and towns from
 
10:16:49.110 --> 10:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
saying no to any type of fuel means
 
10:16:50.790 --> 10:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
pulling the rug out from under towns
 
10:16:52.630 --> 10:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
with climate action plans who are doing
 
10:16:54.790 --> 10:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
great work to lower the costs of their
 
10:16:57.110 --> 10:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and if i know
 
10:16:58.710 --> 10:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
that this kind of reversal of
 
10:17:00.710 --> 10:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
long-standing state policy creates
 
10:17:03.586 --> 10:17:03.596 align:start position:0%
economic uncertainty and hurts the clean
 
10:17:05.746 --> 10:17:05.756 align:start position:0%
energy sector just as defunding new
 
10:17:07.426 --> 10:17:07.436 align:start position:0%
hampshire saves hurt the weatherization
 
10:17:09.830 --> 10:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
sector these are new hampshire jobs and
 
10:17:12.390 --> 10:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
finally if i know that this type of
 
10:17:14.550 --> 10:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
mandate runs counter to long-standing
 
10:17:15.830 --> 10:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
efforts to
 
10:17:17.830 --> 10:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
make new hampshire's energy economy
 
10:17:20.310 --> 10:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
competitive in the region and sends poor
 
10:17:22.310 --> 10:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
pricing signals to new companies looking
 
10:17:24.870 --> 10:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
to do business in the area
 
10:17:26.710 --> 10:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
then would i now press the red button to
 
10:17:28.630 --> 10:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
reject the ought to pass motion so that
 
10:17:31.110 --> 10:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank you

if i know
that

10:17:41.586 --> 10:17:41.596 align:start position:0%
that
 
10:17:43.190 --> 10:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
this is not a home rule state and that
 
10:17:45.190 --> 10:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities should not
 
10:17:48.470 --> 10:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
be restricting types of fuels to use to
 
10:17:48.480 --> 10:17:49.190 align:start position:0%

10:17:53.586 --> 10:17:53.596 align:start position:0%
job of the sec to decide matters like
 
10:17:53.596 --> 10:17:54.470 align:start position:0%

10:31:52.550 --> 10:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
if i believe that we are currently in an
 
10:31:55.510 --> 10:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
energy crisis and if i believe that we
 
10:31:58.870 --> 10:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
you the way we use and obtain energy
 
10:32:01.510 --> 10:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
is in transition and that transition is
 
10:32:02.630 --> 10:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
not over
 
10:32:05.586 --> 10:32:05.596 align:start position:0%
and the work of the oversight committee
 
10:32:07.586 --> 10:32:07.596 align:start position:0%
is far from over
 
10:32:09.586 --> 10:32:09.596 align:start position:0%
if i believe that
 
10:32:12.470 --> 10:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
we need a comprehensive
 
10:32:15.426 --> 10:32:15.436 align:start position:0%
study of all the reports that we get
 
10:32:17.990 --> 10:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
and all the information that we get
 
10:32:20.310 --> 10:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
and that we can't get that in committee
 
10:32:22.390 --> 10:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
many times
 
10:32:25.426 --> 10:32:25.436 align:start position:0%
i believe that we should continue with
 
10:32:28.230 --> 10:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee which does not
 
10:32:31.426 --> 10:32:31.436 align:start position:0%
hurt anything and if i know that this
 
10:32:34.630 --> 10:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
committee has not met
 
10:32:38.870 --> 10:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that it was due to coven
 
10:32:38.880 --> 10:32:40.630 align:start position:0%
i believe that it was due to coven
so

10:32:40.630 --> 10:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
10:32:43.266 --> 10:32:43.276 align:start position:0%
my information was that the
 
10:32:46.070 --> 10:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee had come out with an itl
 
10:32:48.310 --> 10:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
but i believe that this is an odd to
 
10:32:48.320 --> 10:32:49.510 align:start position:0%
but i believe that this is an odd to
pass

10:32:49.510 --> 10:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
pass
 
10:32:52.870 --> 10:32:52.880 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
10:33:33.510 --> 10:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
a new bill was passed to repurpose the
 
10:33:37.030 --> 10:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee but its language was vague
 
10:33:40.550 --> 10:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
and didn't really do the job of defining
 
10:33:43.586 --> 10:33:43.596 align:start position:0%
what the new committee's role would be
 
10:33:45.350 --> 10:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
as a result the committee hasn't met for
 
10:33:47.670 --> 10:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
two or three years
 
10:33:50.550 --> 10:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
if i knew all that mr speaker would i
 
10:33:55.110 --> 10:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
10:33:57.110 --> 10:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill ought to pass as
 
10:35:34.870 --> 10:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
10:35:39.746 --> 10:35:39.756 align:start position:0%
 
10:35:41.830 --> 10:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office has reviewed the
 
10:35:44.230 --> 10:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
video and
 
10:35:45.746 --> 10:35:45.756 align:start position:0%
it is right
 
10:35:47.190 --> 10:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the
 
10:36:01.746 --> 10:36:01.756 align:start position:0%
 
10:36:01.756 --> 10:36:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

10:36:03.110 --> 10:36:03.120 align:start position:0%

10:36:04.550 --> 10:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to take up the amendment
 
10:36:11.266 --> 10:36:11.276 align:start position:0%

and if i know that this requirement
 
10:41:34.950 --> 10:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
means that incumbent telecommunications

service providers
 
10:41:40.710 --> 10:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
must ensure the continuing availability

of life-saving communication services
 
10:41:45.746 --> 10:41:45.756 align:start position:0%
to all

their customers not just 95 percent or
 
10:41:52.150 --> 10:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
97 percent of them
 
10:41:54.390 --> 10:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
and if i recognize that many areas of
 
10:41:57.266 --> 10:41:57.276 align:start position:0%
our state still do not have either
 
10:42:00.950 --> 10:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
reliable broadband service or cell phone
 
10:42:00.960 --> 10:42:02.310 align:start position:0%

that
 
10:56:00.710 --> 10:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is a growing problem the solar
 
10:56:04.070 --> 10:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
panels in in new hampshire that's 153
 
10:56:07.106 --> 10:56:07.116 align:start position:0%
megawatts installed already and by 2025
 
10:56:09.906 --> 10:56:09.916 align:start position:0%
there'll be 389 megawatts and if i know
 
10:56:11.670 --> 10:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
every time i mention megawatts people
 
10:56:13.106 --> 10:56:13.116 align:start position:0%
fall asleep
 
10:56:15.906 --> 10:56:15.916 align:start position:0%
but so i'll turn it into other terms
 
10:56:17.350 --> 10:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
380 my
 
10:56:19.586 --> 10:56:19.596 align:start position:0%
megawatts rent rounding up to 400 that's
 
10:56:22.390 --> 10:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
2 000 2 million panels and if i know
 
10:56:25.106 --> 10:56:25.116 align:start position:0%
that that's 400 acres of panels
 
10:56:27.906 --> 10:56:27.916 align:start position:0%
and if i know that other production
 
10:56:29.990 --> 10:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to site evaluation committee has a
 
10:56:32.550 --> 10:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
re has a plan at end of life but most
 
10:56:34.950 --> 10:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
solar does not go to the recycle
 
10:56:37.266 --> 10:56:37.276 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and if i know
 
10:56:39.426 --> 10:56:39.436 align:start position:0%
that small electronics can handle by a
 
10:56:42.230 --> 10:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
dpw for nominal fees but for the solar
 
10:56:43.746 --> 10:56:43.756 align:start position:0%
panels it can run to thousands of
 
10:56:46.390 --> 10:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
dollars then when i pass this important
 
10:56:50.070 --> 10:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
bill i i also know that califor that
 
10:56:52.630 --> 10:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's modeled after washington bill uh
 
10:56:55.190 --> 10:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
law rather than work representatives
 
10:56:57.670 --> 10:56:57.680 align:start position:0%

the effect

like them
 
11:02:04.150 --> 11:02:04.160 align:start position:0%

pump i visit
 
11:02:11.106 --> 11:02:11.116 align:start position:0%
would i not now push the red button so
 
11:02:12.390 --> 11:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
that another motion may be brought
 
11:02:14.710 --> 11:02:14.720 align:start position:0%

representatives i know that that
 
11:07:31.586 --> 11:07:31.596 align:start position:0%

that this bill fixes the missing money
 
11:07:54.310 --> 11:07:54.320 align:start position:0%

chair recognizes representative mcgee
 
11:18:20.630 --> 11:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
 
11:18:22.790 --> 11:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
speaker colleagues
 
11:18:25.426 --> 11:18:25.436 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill seeks to adjust
 
11:18:28.070 --> 11:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
net metering rates by removing all
 
11:18:30.790 --> 11:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
current charges ex that make up the rate
 
11:18:33.266 --> 11:18:33.276 align:start position:0%
except for the energy itself
 
11:18:36.710 --> 11:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
basically this bill says the wholesale
 
11:18:38.710 --> 11:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
rate of energy is what we should use for
 
11:18:40.150 --> 11:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
net metering credit
 
11:18:41.990 --> 11:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
but if i further know that this is not a
 
11:18:43.990 --> 11:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate method of evaluating the
 
11:18:46.070 --> 11:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
value of net metered energy
 
11:18:48.230 --> 11:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
and that a long pending public utilities
 
11:18:50.710 --> 11:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
commission study on this very topic is
 
11:18:53.350 --> 11:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
due out any day to let us know what that
 
11:18:54.550 --> 11:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
rate should be
 
11:18:56.950 --> 11:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that it is
 
11:18:59.990 --> 11:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
fiscally irresponsible to knowingly
 
11:19:01.990 --> 11:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
create an adverse effect on existing
 
11:19:04.390 --> 11:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facilities and slow
 
11:19:06.790 --> 11:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
planned adoption of new projects by
 
11:19:08.230 --> 11:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
throwing this kind of wrench into the
 
11:19:10.230 --> 11:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
mix when there is no evidence that this
 
11:19:12.470 --> 11:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary calculation is the right price
 
11:19:14.870 --> 11:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
point for a complex market
 
11:19:16.390 --> 11:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
then would i now press
 
11:19:18.790 --> 11:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
the green the red button to stop this
 
11:19:21.586 --> 11:19:21.596 align:start position:0%
bad bill becoming law thank you

11:19:27.906 --> 11:19:27.916 align:start position:0%
speaker mr speaker if i know that the
 
11:19:31.106 --> 11:19:31.116 align:start position:0%
rate being paid to net metering involves
 
11:19:33.266 --> 11:19:33.276 align:start position:0%
lots of costs that they don't see such
 
11:19:35.266 --> 11:19:35.276 align:start position:0%
as risk premiums and on the go i could
 
11:19:37.030 --> 11:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
list a whole mess of them there's a lot
 
11:19:39.030 --> 11:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
of them it raises your electric rates
 
11:19:40.950 --> 11:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
but you know what nothing more i say is
 
11:19:42.390 --> 11:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
going to change a single vote so just
 
11:19:53.030 --> 11:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
11:19:55.106 --> 11:19:55.116 align:start position:0%

11:24:55.746 --> 11:24:55.756 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
11:24:57.350 --> 11:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
that there have been bills aimed at
 
11:25:00.230 --> 11:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
eliminating wreck sweeping for years and
 
11:25:03.106 --> 11:25:03.116 align:start position:0%
in the last session we passed the bill
 
11:25:05.350 --> 11:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
the other body passed the bill
 
11:25:08.550 --> 11:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
but the governor vetoed it
 
11:25:10.630 --> 11:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
thereby violating the new hampshire
 
11:25:13.106 --> 11:25:13.116 align:start position:0%
constitution's guarantees of property
 
11:25:16.630 --> 11:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
rights protection due process and equal
 
11:25:20.230 --> 11:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
protection under the law
 
11:25:22.630 --> 11:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
and if i know that via rex sweeping the
 
11:25:24.550 --> 11:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is seizing the
 
11:25:26.230 --> 11:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
property rights of new hampshire
 
11:25:28.150 --> 11:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
citizens and businesses
 
11:25:29.906 --> 11:25:29.916 align:start position:0%
without their knowledge
 
11:25:32.830 --> 11:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
and without any
 
11:25:35.266 --> 11:25:35.276 align:start position:0%
compensation and if i know that this
 
11:25:37.266 --> 11:25:37.276 align:start position:0%
practice has transferred millions of
 
11:25:39.350 --> 11:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
dollars from new hampshire residents and
 
11:25:42.230 --> 11:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
businesses to private corporations
 
11:25:44.310 --> 11:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
with roughly half yes going to the
 
11:25:46.070 --> 11:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
utilities and
 
11:25:49.266 --> 11:25:49.276 align:start position:0%
pennies on your rate going down but with
 
11:25:50.710 --> 11:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
the other half
 
11:25:52.230 --> 11:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
going to out-of-state private
 
11:25:54.950 --> 11:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
corporations like constellation energy
 
11:25:57.106 --> 11:25:57.116 align:start position:0%
and direct energy
 
11:25:59.106 --> 11:25:59.116 align:start position:0%
thereby placing the state of new
 
11:26:02.070 --> 11:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire in legal jeopardy
 
11:26:04.950 --> 11:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
and lastly if i know that this bill
 
11:26:04.960 --> 11:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
and lastly if i know that this bill
simply

11:26:05.990 --> 11:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
simply
 
11:26:09.586 --> 11:26:09.596 align:start position:0%
informs those customer generators who
 
11:26:12.950 --> 11:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
are being harmed and have been harmed by
 
11:26:14.310 --> 11:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
this practice
 
11:26:17.586 --> 11:26:17.596 align:start position:0%
of the fact of the taking and the means
 
11:26:20.150 --> 11:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
they can take to protect their property
 
11:26:21.990 --> 11:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
from further seizure
 
11:26:24.870 --> 11:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
would i now push the red button
 
11:26:28.070 --> 11:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
11:26:30.150 --> 11:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative thomas
 
11:26:32.630 --> 11:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
11:26:34.390 --> 11:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
11:26:36.870 --> 11:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the state
 
11:26:38.950 --> 11:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
created these wrecks
 
11:26:41.510 --> 11:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
and the state can also take them away
 
11:26:44.070 --> 11:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
but if i also know that these wrecks
 
11:26:46.230 --> 11:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
these unclaimed wrecks are used by the
 
11:26:48.550 --> 11:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
electric utilities to reduce your
 
11:26:49.830 --> 11:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
11:26:52.230 --> 11:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
and if i know that if we stop letting
 
11:26:54.470 --> 11:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
them use these unclaimed rates it will
 
11:26:56.630 --> 11:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
be raising your electric bill and if i
 
11:26:59.266 --> 11:26:59.276 align:start position:0%
believe that's wrong let's press
 
11:26:59.276 --> 11:27:00.550 align:start position:0%
believe that's wrong let's press
the

11:27:00.550 --> 11:27:00.560 align:start position:0%

red button on the green button and get
 
11:27:10.550 --> 11:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
11:27:18.710 --> 11:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
11:27:20.790 --> 11:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
11:27:22.870 --> 11:27:22.880 align:start position:0%

is a division vote you're in favor
 
11:27:26.230 --> 11:27:26.240 align:start position:0%

11:27:51.116 --> 11:28:01.106 align:start position:0%
 
so

11:28:01.106 --> 11:28:01.116 align:start position:0%
 
11:28:01.116 --> 11:28:19.106 align:start position:0%
 
so

11:28:19.106 --> 11:28:19.116 align:start position:0%
 
11:28:42.950 --> 11:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
11:28:44.470 --> 11:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
if all members president had an
 
11:28:46.550 --> 11:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote house will tend to
 
11:28:50.990 --> 11:28:51.000 align:start position:0%

11:29:12.230 --> 11:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
will call it a parliamentary inquiry

of my colleagues would acknowledge that
 
11:29:20.470 --> 11:29:20.480 align:start position:0%

tired and bleary-eyed as we all are
 
11:29:26.790 --> 11:29:26.800 align:start position:0%

honorable colleagues
 
11:37:42.790 --> 11:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
i rise today to offer an amendment
 
11:37:44.310 --> 11:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
located in your seat pockets if you'd
 
11:37:45.830 --> 11:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
like to read along
 
11:37:48.150 --> 11:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
to house concurrent resolution 7
 
11:37:50.070 --> 11:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
reaffirming our support for the nation
 
11:37:51.906 --> 11:37:51.916 align:start position:0%
of israel and the location of the
 
11:37:53.906 --> 11:37:53.916 align:start position:0%
embassy therein
 
11:37:56.310 --> 11:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
what my amendment seeks to do is make
 
11:37:59.190 --> 11:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
this resolution less controversial by
 
11:38:00.630 --> 11:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
removing the section relating to the
 
11:38:03.190 --> 11:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
moving of the embassy to jerusalem and
 
11:38:04.950 --> 11:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
by adding a section about supporting the
 
11:38:09.510 --> 11:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
israel israeli-palestinian peace process
 
11:38:11.830 --> 11:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
the moving of the embassy to jerusalem
 
11:38:13.990 --> 11:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
was a very controversial one
 
11:38:16.790 --> 11:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
as jerusalem is claimed by both israel
 
11:38:18.550 --> 11:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
and palestine
 
11:38:20.150 --> 11:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
the united states should not be picking
 
11:38:22.470 --> 11:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
aside in this decades-long conflict and
 
11:38:24.950 --> 11:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
should serve instead as a neutral
 
11:38:24.960 --> 11:38:26.070 align:start position:0%
should serve instead as a neutral
arbiter

11:38:26.070 --> 11:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
arbiter
 
11:38:28.470 --> 11:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
the united states cannot be considered a
 
11:38:31.266 --> 11:38:31.276 align:start position:0%
neutral arbiter if it is picking a side
 
11:38:34.070 --> 11:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
on who owns jerusalem
 
11:38:36.870 --> 11:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
secondly it adds after the section about
 
11:38:39.586 --> 11:38:39.596 align:start position:0%
reaffirming our support for israel and i
 
11:38:39.596 --> 11:38:40.470 align:start position:0%
reaffirming our support for israel and i
quote

11:38:40.470 --> 11:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
quote
 
11:38:42.390 --> 11:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire general court
 
11:38:44.310 --> 11:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes the right of the palestinian
 
11:38:46.550 --> 11:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
people to exist and that the new
 
11:38:48.950 --> 11:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire general court supports the
 
11:38:48.960 --> 11:38:50.630 align:start position:0%
hampshire general court supports the
israeli-palestinian

11:38:50.630 --> 11:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
israeli-palestinian
 
11:38:52.870 --> 11:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
peace process
 
11:38:55.190 --> 11:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
now i believe that every member in this
 
11:38:58.310 --> 11:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
house can agree that we support peace in
 
11:39:00.150 --> 11:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
the middle east and for a peaceful
 
11:39:02.310 --> 11:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
resolution to this conflict
 
11:39:04.870 --> 11:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is why i ask for a roll call so
 
11:39:07.350 --> 11:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
that we can see who stands for peace and
 
11:39:09.030 --> 11:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
who does not
 
11:39:10.870 --> 11:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that if this amendment were to
 
11:39:13.266 --> 11:39:13.276 align:start position:0%
pass that we would pass this underlying
 
11:39:15.586 --> 11:39:15.596 align:start position:0%
resolution unanimously
 
11:39:17.670 --> 11:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
that is why i ask for your support on
 
11:39:19.746 --> 11:39:19.756 align:start position:0%
this important amendment and to please
 
11:39:24.070 --> 11:39:24.080 align:start position:0%

11:39:30.310 --> 11:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
some of the branches requested a roll
 
11:39:33.830 --> 11:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
calls that sufficiently seconded
 
11:39:35.586 --> 11:39:35.596 align:start position:0%
is sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
11:39:37.426 --> 11:39:37.436 align:start position:0%
roll call vote we're on our final
 
11:39:40.310 --> 11:39:40.320 align:start position:0%

for decades essentially since shortly
 
11:40:28.710 --> 11:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
after the founding of the state of

11:40:34.390 --> 11:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
the move to the embassy
 
11:40:36.230 --> 11:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
was voted by the congress of the united

many years ago
 
11:40:40.150 --> 11:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
under several administrations and

finally was implemented under the trump

finally was implemented under the trump
administration

11:40:44.230 --> 11:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
administration
 
11:40:46.550 --> 11:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
before the embassy and before israel
 
11:40:49.350 --> 11:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
took back control of jerusalem
 
11:40:51.586 --> 11:40:51.596 align:start position:0%
in the 67 war when it was under the

control of jordan
 
11:40:55.586 --> 11:40:55.596 align:start position:0%

11:41:07.586 --> 11:41:07.596 align:start position:0%
if you look at this amendment
 
11:41:10.470 --> 11:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
it basically guts the underlying
 
11:41:13.426 --> 11:41:13.436 align:start position:0%
resolution completely
 
11:41:16.230 --> 11:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
for a peace process to work
 
11:41:19.030 --> 11:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
the parties involved in the conflict
 
11:41:21.670 --> 11:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
all the parties involved in the conflict
 
11:41:23.426 --> 11:41:23.436 align:start position:0%
must want peace
 
11:41:28.230 --> 11:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
11:41:30.070 --> 11:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
that is not the case with the so-called
 
11:41:32.310 --> 11:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
palestinian people
 
11:41:32.320 --> 11:41:33.426 align:start position:0%
palestinian people
they

11:41:33.426 --> 11:41:33.436 align:start position:0%
they
 
11:41:35.990 --> 11:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
their principal spokesman
 
11:41:38.070 --> 11:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
are from a designated terrorist
 
11:41:41.266 --> 11:41:41.276 align:start position:0%
organization called hamas
 
11:41:44.390 --> 11:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
hamas has in its charter
 
11:41:46.390 --> 11:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
its goal of the destruction of the state
 
11:41:47.670 --> 11:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
of israel
 
11:41:49.510 --> 11:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
fails to recognize the right of the
 
11:41:52.070 --> 11:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
state of israel to exist
 
11:41:54.950 --> 11:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
controls the gaza strip from which it
 
11:41:57.510 --> 11:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
builds underground tunnels to infiltrate
 
11:42:00.230 --> 11:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
terrorists into the state of israel
 
11:42:02.310 --> 11:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
reigns rockets down
 
11:42:09.030 --> 11:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
11:42:10.710 --> 11:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend stage
 
11:42:10.720 --> 11:42:11.906 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend stage
appointment

11:42:11.906 --> 11:42:11.916 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
11:42:14.870 --> 11:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
stage a point of order i believe uh the
 
11:42:17.906 --> 11:42:17.916 align:start position:0%
member uh unfairly generalized a whole
 
11:42:19.586 --> 11:42:19.596 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
11:42:22.470 --> 11:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
into a one terrorist organization
 
11:42:24.950 --> 11:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's fair there's
 
11:42:30.310 --> 11:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
11:42:31.906 --> 11:42:31.916 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it's a matter of fact that
 
11:42:34.230 --> 11:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
the hamas is the principal spokesman of
 
11:42:37.586 --> 11:42:37.596 align:start position:0%
the palestinian people
 
11:42:37.596 --> 11:42:38.870 align:start position:0%
the palestinian people
the

11:42:38.870 --> 11:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
11:42:41.030 --> 11:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
hamas hamas
 
11:42:41.040 --> 11:42:44.470 align:start position:0%
hamas hamas
hamas's

11:42:44.470 --> 11:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
11:42:46.310 --> 11:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
hamas statement
 
11:42:48.070 --> 11:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
which has been repeated
 
11:42:50.550 --> 11:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
which has been repeated publicly
 
11:42:53.106 --> 11:42:53.116 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of months by a member
 
11:42:54.950 --> 11:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
of this very house
 
11:42:58.070 --> 11:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
from the river to the sea palestine will
 
11:42:59.190 --> 11:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
be free
 
11:43:02.230 --> 11:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
