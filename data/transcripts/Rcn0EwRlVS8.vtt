00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative oxen here
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
and representative McWilliams and
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
all right that's it
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
so the subject of this particular
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is to discuss whether to
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation or not
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation uh
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
the items in Senate Bill 259 and what
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
that that bill does is adds to the
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
definition of a municipal host uh
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
political subdivision the state of New
 
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.970 align:start position:0%
political subdivision the state of New
Hampshire

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:54.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
uh housing authorities
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
quasi-public entities and the peas
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
Development Authority
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
so I open this for discussion from any
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
oh what's up
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
all right uh members of the committee as
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
well as members of our broader committee
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
any any comments on the appropriateness
 
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:36.860 align:start position:0%
of moving this legislation forward
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
but I do uh I'm getting that way after
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
retirement watch
 
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
but I I really believe that this this
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
should move forward at least for
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
discussion I would recommend that the
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
committee take further action on it
 
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.630 align:start position:0%
committee take further action on it
because

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
we are now where I think everybody is
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
this morning I saw two people down there
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
and the governor would say it we're
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
talking about expanding wind power and I
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
know in Rockingham County we're talking
 
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
about expanding
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
solar so I think it's very important to
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
expand our definitions that doesn't
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean
 
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
that they have to but I think that this
 
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
is worthy of future action
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative action thank you very
 
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
much we discuss this matter in the late
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
spring a chair votes agree and and his
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
Works were we need to fix those
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important for us to go
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
forward and allow the amendment which we
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
were not able to pass at that time to
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
come to the floor of the house in
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
January so that we can expand this
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
definition to make sure that we're all
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with the with the chart with
 
00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.330 align:start position:0%
familiar with the with the chart with
the

00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
boundary lines we need to take the
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
handcuffs and the obstacles off we need
 
00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:06.539 align:start position:0%
we need to get out of the way so we can
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
have the expansion of solar wind our
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
homegrown natural resources for our
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
energy use and I think this this bill
 
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
would be an important vehicle for this
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
not in its present form but with the
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
amendment that we discussed uh it could
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
make a positive contribution so I would
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
support Passage
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
recommending that it go forward with the
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
understanding of the amendment would be
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
brought forward can I just
 
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.990 align:start position:0%
brought forward can I just
yes

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
we're informal here there's no there's
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
no we're not we're not by the
 
00:23:42.659 --> 00:23:43.970 align:start position:0%
no we're not we're not by the
um

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
I don't believe
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
what you're going to have to do is draft
 
00:23:50.409 --> 00:23:50.419 align:start position:0%
a whole new piece of legislation for
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
January and you can't you know
 
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
incorporate the amendment or do what you
 
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
need to do but you have to draw a whole
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
new piece of legislation anything that
 
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
was in study right now is kind of dead
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
we'll report out on what we recommend
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
but a whole new bill has to be brought
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
in in January and I think that's worthy
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
of doing
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to add a PS a post-script
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
governor also mentioned hydroxide so
 
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
he's he's really he's really interested
 
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
in uh expanding what we need because the
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
I agree I agree we can look at the um
 
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
you know and with the amendment which
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
never was officially brought forward if
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
I remember correct right because it was
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
too late or oh it was there but the
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
prior amendment that had been voted on
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
and it was not the chair did not
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
entertain the amendment that's what I
 
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
thought I'm trying to remember that I
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
did say we need to fix yes yes so
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
my recollection on this bill is yes we
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
need to fix it uh this bill is currently
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
written I agree with representative
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
Kelly Pitts that this this cannot go
 
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
forward as as is currently written uh I
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
think there was General agreement that
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
expanding the definition of a political
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
subdivision to include the states made
 
00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:20.950 align:start position:0%
subdivision to include the states made
sense

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
and representative oxenhams
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
comments on dealing with the municipal
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
boundary issues is another concern that
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
is relevant for legislative action
 
00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.710 align:start position:0%
is relevant for legislative action
um

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
housing authorities and quasi
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
development or quasi-public entities and
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
whatnot was I
 
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.130 align:start position:0%
whatnot was I
I

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:45.140 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
recollect not much of a of of didn't
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have much traction and it
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't with me because the
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
definition of what that meant was not
 
00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:58.580 align:start position:0%
there and
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
I really am sensitive to to the Whole
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
Net metering passing costs off from one
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
group to another
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to a whole municipality
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue because everybody in
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
municipality is benefiting from that
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the state everybody in
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
the state benefits from that but if we
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
start selecting up little subgroups now
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's not as clean so that's kind of
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
where I am on this
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
because I drove 110 miles an hour
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I I didn't just say
 
00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
I want to refer to Rockingham County
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
which is putting up a 4.9 megawatt solar
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
array which will take care of the
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
complex the complex
 
00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:48.299 align:start position:0%
Dover Stratford county is going to build
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
a new nursing home
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
and they have plenty of land out there
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
they can do something similar
 
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.330 align:start position:0%
they can do something similar
and

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
take care of that complex so don't uh
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate in your discussion in your
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion keep housing
 
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.549 align:start position:0%
further discussion keep housing
authorities

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
and counties
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
in my housing authorities
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
are in trouble because of the high
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
electric rates and a lot of those
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
contracts that they had are going to run
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
out so keep that in mind and
 
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could have some ppos with
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
those who are usually contained within
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
the municipality but not really part of
 
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.289 align:start position:0%
the municipality but not really part of
it

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
so think about that when you when you
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
move forward but but it in all
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
move forward yeah I I think those terms
 
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.149 align:start position:0%
move forward yeah I I think those terms
need

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
cleaner definition because as as you
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
talked about uh County Services for a
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
County Complex
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
where it's all self-contained that's one
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:03.299 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:19.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I do firmly believe that we're going
 
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
to be given the data that shows how
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
Pair by reducing load so yeah the notion
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
that we want to be careful about
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
expanding I think maybe less of an issue
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
once once we have that data
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
and the notion that I want to support
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
firmly and it's expanding our access to
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
low-cost home-grown resources
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if this is best to help
 
00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
with that but it has a sufficient
 
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.289 align:start position:0%
with that but it has a sufficient
sufficient

00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
beneficial aspects that I would still
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
support the bill going forward with the
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
notion that someone could bring forth
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
and on the floor in January I understand
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
you can't imagine it
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
you can't even bring the bill back you
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
have to write a whole new bill right so
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
what what we have to recommend is this
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
this bill is recommended to be brought
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
forward as further legislation so you
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
essentially refile it and if we're going
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
to refile it I would
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
seriously consider that you fix the
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
issues in it because so you don't refile
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
it as as is or we don't recommend as it
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
is it's recommended for for the
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislation which is where I think this
 
00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:48.419 align:start position:0%
bill is as is currently written
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
in this form it's not it shouldn't be
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
recommended if we're going to go do
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
then we recommend that whatever that
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
I won't be here I
 
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
will vote for the one thing that I can
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:18.490 align:start position:0%
have to say
um

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
um the state
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
was added to the law
 
00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:54.830 align:start position:0%
was added to the law
um

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
I don't remember it might have been a
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
house bill that the senate had where
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
they added it and then yes yes that was
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes it is here it was the first
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
amendment and then this went back to
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
this or came from the Senate and they
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
added these other items which are less
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
well defined that's the problem with
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
this bill in my mind but the state is I
 
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
so the state we don't have to be
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
concerned about it with this bill
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
whether this bill is recommended or it
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
isn't because it's already been part of
 
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:42.980 align:start position:0%
an agreements
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
I don't have that field number where
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.529 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
then I would suggest that we vote on
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
whether we are going to recommend this
 
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
bill as it currently exists
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
to be refiled for or recommended for
 
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
future legislation or not recommended as
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
it currently exists for future
 
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.470 align:start position:0%
it currently exists for future
legislation

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
to call a role first of all I like to
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
make a I like to make a motion that we
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
do we do have to do that I make a motion
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
that we uh
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
make this considered for future
 
00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:46.430 align:start position:0%
make this considered for future
legislation

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.950 align:start position:0%
okay

all right uh we have no further business
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
than this
