00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 align:start position:0%

didn't get any more than that
 
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's added on to what we have
 
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit less than what we had
 
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
last year where we had 130 39 bills
 
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 align:start position:0%

the implementation of the alternative

dispute resolution processes fall within
 
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
the purview of the Department of
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
education's office of dispute resolution
 
00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 align:start position:0%
and constituent complaints
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
the Department's alternative dispute
 
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
resolution processes are flexible
 
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
confidential and informal processes in
 
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
which an impartial third party assess
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
parents and school districts to resolve

a conflict
 
00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
the trained alternative dispute
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
resolution officer's goal is to help the
 
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
parties to explore the issues and
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
ultimately where possible to resolve the
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
issues the goal throughout is to open up
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
communication and reduce conflict
 
00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 align:start position:0%
between the parties
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 135 would add in a provision
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
that would allow for a continuance of
 
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
the relevant process if mutually agreed
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
to buy the parties this will provide for
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
more flexibility in scheduling sessions
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
as the current 30-day limitation can
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
hinder successful resolution
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%

support with them if they choose to do
so

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes what this does is it causes
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
the timelines to
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
in doubt needing to be extended because
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
you have so many people that want to be
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
part of the mediation
 
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
the desired outcome throughout is to
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
open up communication reduce conflict
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
between the parties and ultimately for
 
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
the parties to resolve the problem and
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
put their agreement in writing
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
the change in language to Senate Bill
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
135 to include the opportunity for
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
parties to mutually agree to schedule it
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
to continue a schedule will be
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the parties there are
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
times when one day of mediation for
 
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
example does not afford the parties
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
enough time to dissolve resolve the
 
00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
enough time to dissolve resolve the
dispute

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
for example a second day of mediation
 
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
beyond the established 30-day window may
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
be all that is needed to resolve the
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
dispute additionally parties are often
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
accompanied by Council who for whatever
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
reason previous case or Court
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
commitments is unavailable for dates
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
previously agreed to by the parties
 
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
other times a rescheduled beyond the
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
statutory 30-day time frame may be
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
required due to a necessary expert or
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
School official on leave or other
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
required commitments or a parent with
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
work of family constraints
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes a follow-up session or
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
sessions is necessary to hammer out
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
details on especially difficult cases
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
involving IEP individualized education
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
plans placement and compensatory
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
Services there are instances where
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
parties are in agreement on a placement
 
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
of program but before final signatures
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
can be applied to the final agreement
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
they are waiting on Expert reports or
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
openings to an approved non-public
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
school placement that may take more than
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
the change to RSA 186c 23 would remedy
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
those challenges to the limitations of
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
the 30-day time frame
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all I have
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
anything else from the Department I'm
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
really just playing the role of a potted
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
plant it's really nice when
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
um Stephen and I work together and he's
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
just so incredibly competent there's not
 
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
much more for me to say or do here but I
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
think it's great when we the department
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to bring people
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
forward to these committees so that you
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
can see the the faces behind the behind
 
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
all the hard work Stephen has done an
 
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
amazing job building up this program and
 
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
facilitating this program and he's happy
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that this
 
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
committee thank you I do have one
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
um when we have to go this route to get
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
some resolution by the term parties who
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
are the parties is it's who's bringing
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
this forward uh the school district or
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
the mediator can you explain what's your
 
00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
definition of parties is sure that's a
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
fair question uh generally speaking it's
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
parents our party and the school
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
district so they're the two main parties
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
to the hearing or it to the mediation a
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
lot of times mediation is is through the
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
due process hearing process but a lot of
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
times it's Standalone as well and they
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
can have neutral conference moderator
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
session or mediation it depends upon
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
what they want so back to the initial
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
question yes party is largely the
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
parents the student and the school
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
district so those would be the parties
 
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:42.740 align:start position:0%
it is is
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
the legal advice being given to the par
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
of the parent part of the party or is in
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
other words if the attorney can't be
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
there at the scheduled time is that
 
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
cause for moving this beyond the 30 days
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes that does happen a lot where parent
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
attorneys are unavailable and so they
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
ask for continuance however that's also
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
true that school district attorneys
 
00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
true that school district attorneys
sometimes

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
need an extension because they're not
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
able to make it on that time
 
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
having said that when they file the
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
request for mediation if it's Standalone
 
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
mediation they are requested to provide
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
three to four mutually agreed upon dates
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
and then with those dates we reach out
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
to whoever the person is it's going to
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
be the mediator the neutral or the
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
moderator to see whether they can meet
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
on those dates and if so it gets
 
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.530 align:start position:0%
on those dates and if so it gets
scheduled

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:36.860 align:start position:0%
so what happens with the request for
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
continuances sometimes comes about after
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's already been scheduled
 
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:44.180 align:start position:0%
maybe because of the question about
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
largely these are placement issues there
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
could be assessment issues whether the
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
child needs a different coding
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
um so there's a variety of reasons why
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
they reschedule
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we like at the
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
department because we like to have
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
things done as soon as possible but this
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
is for the parties that's the reason
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
we're bringing it forward for for
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
parents as well as school districts
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Steve are there questions
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Miler well thank you Mr
 
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here and
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question I really have three
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
questions one is who are the mediators
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
during these sessions uh one two how
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
many uh incidents do you have how many
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
of these interventions do you have in a
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
given year and what percent of those
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
interventions need this extended period
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
so the mediators also act as hearing
 
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
officers but if they are
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
assigned as mediators they will not be
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer in the case
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
you currently we have six individuals
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
they're all attorneys
 
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.730 align:start position:0%
they're all attorneys
uh

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
and some of them have been with us for a
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
number of years some are new
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
um contract is coming up in July so
 
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
we'll have an additional and then two uh
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
well actually one has passed away
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh we'll have one less two less actually
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of what was the second question
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
of these types of matters come forward
 
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
every year I would say we have about 30
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
to 40. alternative dispute resolution I
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
can get those numbers to you that's fine
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and I would say that the majority
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
like how many actually need a
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
continuance percentage-wise the
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise how many need a
 
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
continuance probably 85 to 90 percent
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
really yeah thank you very much
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent Belcher
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:51.470 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
I think the
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
the heart of this that I that I don't
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
fully understand
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
is that if there's because the way the
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
way the law reads us currently we're
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
talking about students whose parents
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
have rejected either an IEP educational
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
placement identification or evaluation
 
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
of a child so I'm I'm trying to
 
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
understand is this something that is
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
utilized when the school wants to move
 
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
forward with these and the parent does
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
not want any of these or is it or is it
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
more along the lines of the school wants
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
to move forward and the parents want to
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
move forward but with a different plan
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
so I think largely it's initiated by
 
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.750 align:start position:0%
so I think largely it's initiated by
parents

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
because they want something that the
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
school district does not want to agree
 
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.250 align:start position:0%
school district does not want to agree
to

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
and so under under the law they have a
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
right to mediation through due process
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
hearing as well as Standalone so for
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
example parent wants their child to not
 
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.310 align:start position:0%
example parent wants their child to not
be

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.449 align:start position:0%
be
um

00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
placed in the school district they want
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
their child to go to another school that
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
may be better you know an outside
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
placement and that would be subject to a
 
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.970 align:start position:0%
placement and that would be subject to a
mediation

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh or for example the IEP there's
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
something that the parent wants in the
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
IEP or some services and the school
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
district says no or reading Specialists
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
or things like that and so apparent that
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
can be open for mediation what we try to
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
do because the federal government the
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
U.S Department of Education is really
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
keen on trying to negotiate instead of
 
00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
going through a full due process hearing
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
that whenever you have the opportunity
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
to try to negotiate to resolve disputes
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
that's their goal and they make we at
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
the state have to set goals every year
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
to what
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
um you know 80 percent of the cases need
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
to be mediated that's the goal of the
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily what occurs sure
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
if I if I may because I think I heard
 
00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:56.339 align:start position:0%
the the important answer and I want to
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
make sure I heard it correctly so these
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
are these are initiated by parents not
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
by schools no they're by parents and
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
schools but largely by parents that have
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
a dispute with the school district
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
because the school district does not
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
want uh to for example pay for
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
replacement or if reading Specialists or
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
a special assessment a sec you know
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
outside uh I'm not an expert with
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
special ed so I I just have to be either
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
too much
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
yeah either party but in large part what
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
we see are parents filing if I may just
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
please once more just to clarify further
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
so the circumstances under which a
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
school might file to go through this
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
process would it be a circumstance
 
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
perhaps where a parent does not want
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
their child evaluated or placed in an
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
IED IEP program but the school wants to
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
move forward with it
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
and negotiate with them towards that end
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
no sometimes what happens is that like
 
00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:57.419 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
um there is a safety issue the school
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
district May request a hearing and
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
mediation could be part of that
 
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.330 align:start position:0%
mediation could be part of that
um

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
I I have to be cautious because I'm not
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
like again Natasha lupiani my my
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
colleague that handles special ed
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
complaints is the expert in Special Ed I
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
do everything so I can't like I do
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship I do all
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh regular education issues but
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
special education is not my forte
 
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
special education is not my forte
although

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
although
 
00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:35.059 align:start position:0%
um you know clearly as administrator
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
overseeing the hearings process I have
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
that role I will say that what I see
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
largely are IEP issues service issues
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
placement and it's largely parents that
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
are requesting
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cascadden do
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
you have a question just wanted to add
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
that it's not necessarily
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
um in a special ed situation it's the
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
school district tries to develop a
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
program or provide Personnel that's
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
going to meet the needs of that child
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
for them to make progress and if the
 
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
parents have their mindset on something
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's where you need a hearing officer
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
but generally the school really bends
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
over backwards to accommodate the needs
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
of the child but the parents might have
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
an idea that the needs of the child are
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
something different
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
so and no evaluation can be done without
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
parent permission so I just wanted to
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
add that representative cordelli
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you both for being here
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
on a Monday morning
 
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
um we've had discussions about who are
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
allowable participants in an IEP meeting
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
have there been issues as to
 
00:19:47.529 --> 00:19:47.539 align:start position:0%
um who can participate in mediation
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
discussions thinking particularly you
 
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the parents can bring an
 
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.950 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the parents can bring an
activist

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
activist
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
an advocate or a lawyer have there been
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
issues in that regard that you're aware
 
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.890 align:start position:0%
issues in that regard that you're aware
of

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
so we changed the form
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
and added a box on the form for all of
 
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.950 align:start position:0%
and added a box on the form for all of
our

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:12.500 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution processes
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
that parents can sign I I want to attend
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
mediation with an attorney or I want to
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
have a mediation for example without an
 
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.669 align:start position:0%
have a mediation for example without an
attorney

00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
and the hope of that is that then the
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
school district may see that and say
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
well if they're not going to bring an
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
attorney we won't
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
but we can't require that the answer is
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
they can bring whoever they wish
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
um so if they if they want to have an
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
advocate or if they want to have their
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
grandparent and sometimes that's
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
happened before
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
they can bring whomever they want
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
they just at the initiation of a
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
mediation will request that they file
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
out the pay file the paperwork that
 
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
states who the parties are and then who
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
is going to be with the parties to speak
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
yes I just wonder can we get a copy of
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
that form
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you further questions from
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
Nancy thank you very much thank you
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome thank you and I
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
don't have any other pink cards up here
 
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
on SB 135 so with that I'm going to
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
close the hearing
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
and we will be opening up uh SB 151 in
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
we're going through one of these up in
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
Haverhill right now where the parent
 
00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead with this
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
relative to mental health education and
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
I welcome Senator Waters well good
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
the committee nice to see you all I'm
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters from District Four
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
to introduce Senate Bill
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
151 relative to mental health uh
 
00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:50.630 align:start position:0%
151 relative to mental health uh
education

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
um the bill simply adds mental health
 
00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:55.820 align:start position:0%
explicitly to our adequate education
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
statutes on sound Wellness
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
and health
 
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
and let me just give a little background
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
about how this bill came
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
um to be it certainly is in part of
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
response to what we're hearing from our
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
schools and from our youth about
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
increasing issues not just from from
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
covert times because these have been
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
some trend lines about issues around
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
mental health that have been noticed in
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
our in our schools
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and you know we know that about one
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
in six United States youth experience a
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
mental health disorder
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
each year we've dealt with issues of
 
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
bullying certainly uh in the in the
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
legislature that can that contributes um
 
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
we know the tragic statistics about
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
youth suicide and attempted
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
um suicides and if you look to the youth
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey you get a little
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
finer grid on what our students are are
 
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.250 align:start position:0%
finer grid on what our students are are
reporting

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.330 align:start position:0%
reporting
um

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
34 felt sad or hopeless 18 seriously
 
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
considered suicide seven percent
 
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.430 align:start position:0%
considered suicide seven percent
attempted

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
attempted
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
suicide these are affected by the
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
substantial rates we have in the state
 
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:10.700 align:start position:0%
of substance
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
misuse drugs and alcohol
 
00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.289 align:start position:0%
misuse drugs and alcohol
um

00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
and 23 percent experience fully on
 
00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
campus 20 percent
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
um excuse me a 10 experienced sexual
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
violence uh seven percent were
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
physically forced to have
 
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
sexual intercourse so these are fact
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
these are factors and uh you know
 
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:33.299 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of a lot of
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
difficulties that our youth are
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
are um facing and we do teach Health in
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
schools and so it seems that schools are
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
very effective and efficient place in
 
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
order for us to make sure that we're
 
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.070 align:start position:0%
order for us to make sure that we're
providing

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
um students with the understanding need
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
of mental health uh just disorders
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
um but also so they can recognize
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
um these issues in themselves and
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
perhaps in their in their peers I've
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
gone to school in some ways on the
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer program some Dover for
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
example Dover High has a student Club
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
where they do daily check-ins with other
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
students and ask the kind of questions
 
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:12.299 align:start position:0%
about how you doing today and and they
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
are trained to understand what some of
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
the signs may be and they can offer
 
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
some conversation or or some reference
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
to help the students might be able to
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
get if they're if they're having certain
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
feelings or haven't had certain
 
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
feelings or haven't had certain
experiences

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
I think particularly because of the
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
contributing factor of uh drug and
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
alcohol misuse disorders which are high
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
in this in this state I serve on the
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
governor's commission alcohol and and
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
other drugs and we regularly do fund
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
groups in the schools that try to help
 
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
with peer-to-peer counseling and
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
educational programs and those factors
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
so as we all know you know mental health
 
00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
and other factors are are combined here
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
one of the real Inspirations for this um
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
has been in some ways the governor's
 
00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:57.169 align:start position:0%
has been in some ways the governor's
leadership

00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
um he had conversations with his
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
Governor's youth advisory commission and
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
um they brought up the issue of what
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
they're hearing about mental health and
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
the government was particularly
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
concerned and asked kind of asked the
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
council to look into mental health
 
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.169 align:start position:0%
council to look into mental health
issues

00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
um and to in their report to him to make
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
some recommendations about what what
 
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:19.940 align:start position:0%
could be done to address mental health
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
uh education in the schools so that
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
report was sent to the to the governor
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
in accordance with his desire to work on
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
this and again I want emphasize because
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
my work with the governor on Alcohol and
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs and mental health issues
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
that you know this is something that
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
he's really concerned about for our
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
youth and so that's that's the um the
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
origin of the bill so let's turn to the
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill itself and I'll I'll just talk
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
through the approach that is taken
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
um I think it's going to be very helpful
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
to us to have mental health here in
 
00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:51.539 align:start position:0%
these two places in the inadequacy
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
um yes under education rules there is a
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
discussion of mental health in the
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
Health curriculum but what was reported
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
in the investigations that the
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
governor's youth advisory council did at
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
the behest of the governor was that it
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
was very spotty as to whether mental
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
health was being treated in health
 
00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:15.110 align:start position:0%
health was being treated in health
education

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
whether the teachers had adequate
 
00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.529 align:start position:0%
whether the teachers had adequate
information

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
and capacity to teach it whether they
 
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
had accurate information up to date
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
information on the issues that the youth
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
are are facing so as we have done with
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
other aspects of um adequacy uh having
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
it in here and then directing that there
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
be a curriculum made available is a way
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're helping our our
 
00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.110 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're helping our our
students

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.830 align:start position:0%
students
um

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
then what it asks here is for the
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
Department to make the rules and you'll
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
see there's a rather comprehensive list
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
here of the issues that emerge around
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
mental health so that the curriculum
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
that is provided can provide good
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
accurate information for the schools on
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
these on these subjects
 
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
the bill was also structured this way
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
kind of looking back to what we did on
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse prevention education
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
we're wanting to avoid an unfunded
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
mandate for our local schools we took
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
this similar path
 
00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
and though on a different subject a
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
couple years ago the chairman and I
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
worked on outdoor recreation being
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
included in adequacy but the same
 
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
pattern it was not requiring the local
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
student districts to Bear the expense of
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
developing that curriculum but
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
established a pattern where by it could
 
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
be done in cooperation with the
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
community college system and and other
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
folks as well so that was the that was
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
the model here
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
um to have the the rule making
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
um that that would that would be done
 
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk a little bit more about
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
the FI the fiscal note in a moment and I
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
think very importantly at the bottom of
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
um the first page here the parental
 
00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:53.690 align:start position:0%
um the first page here the parental
consent

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm really very grateful to Senator
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
gendro and Senators Lang in Senate
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
education along the other members there
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
who said well let's button this up about
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
parental rights you know we already have
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
in statute as you see here the parents
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
have to be able to have the right to opt
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
into this or you know into this
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum and so the idea as you'll see
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
in the bowl there at the very end this
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph shall specifically apply to
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
any course material mental health now
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
one might say that's a little redundant
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
but I think it's useful I mean I I you
 
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
know having been a parent myself and
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
parental consent
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
parental rights we have a lot of
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
conversation about that and I think
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
particularly in this area that's
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
important to have you want to make sure
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
that the parents know and parents want
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
their their children to have good mental
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
health education but they want to know
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
what that's going to involve and whether
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know how they how their own family
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
beliefs and culture would feel about
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
that so that's what's that's what's
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
there uh in the substance of it let me
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
talk about the the physical note
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
and um you know I want to start with
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
that I this bill derived from a lot of
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
conversations with commissioner Ada blue
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
and others
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
um with nami and various folks about and
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
with the governor's youth advisory
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
Council about how how do we do and what
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
do we include and um I really appreciate
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
the guidance of commissioner adabu and
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
others on how to get this bill to a
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
place that it would it would work for
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
um I will say that I had not anticipated
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
the physical note that's why I had not
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
put an appropriation here I wanted to
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
avoid any unfunded mandate and um
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
thought there would not be necessarily
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
such a cost in finding available
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
curricula online that then then could be
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
posted as a link for educators to use
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
with some with some guidance as I said
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
we've done before
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
since the time the um additional
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with Department of
 
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
Education about about the cost and
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
um and just in order it came through
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
fine Senate Finance we knew about this
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh unanimously as well as the policy
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
um committee and um since that time I
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
started to look around and see okay what
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
what is being provided out there across
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
the country and you may have a letter
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
from Meet marrow
 
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and that is one company I've had some
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
conversation with that provides online
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh and education before
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
teachers in how to deliver that
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum and they are have a capacity
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
in what they do to tailor and to look at
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
what state statute is what to require
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
what they can do what they can't do and
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
to tailor their any curriculum they
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
offer electronically to the actual
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
requirements of the state there are
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
other places to do this so I think the
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity is there
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and I've had conversation with a
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
member of Senate Finance we have his in
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
the house we have an add-on with list
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
where things that emerge between the
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
beginning of the budget and when the
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
Senate deals with it we have add-ons and
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I have the conversation about we'll
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
put this on the add-on list so that um
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
that that funding can be provided into
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
that said I will say that
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's a small price to pay
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
for mental health education
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
if we can help one student
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
not contemplate suicide or act on those
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
feelings if we can help some students
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
deal with substance abuse or disorder or
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
help students deal with the other issues
 
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:27.140 align:start position:0%
that they're seeing or with their peers
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
I I think that's that we've done
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
something very good and and also you
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
know mental health education like health
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
education is is Lifetime education isn't
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
it the school the skills that they're
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
going to learn in school will help them
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their lives so Saturday
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
once along Mr chairman but I wanted to
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
kind of address each of those issues
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much before I take any
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
questions I do have one
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to determine where the line
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
is here between the responsibilities of
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
the school psychologist
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that of the classroom teacher now I
 
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
looked at Ed 306 that's our education
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
rules for and it says School
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
psychologists shall provide
 
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:11.660 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Psychological Services
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
throughout various environments and it
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
goes on and it identifies those and the
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
school psychologist is also trained of
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
course and and a member of the National
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
Association of school psychologist as
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
its reference in the 8306 which has
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
principles for professional ethics
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
these individuals are very well
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
qualified and that's to deal with
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
students with mental issues and I agree
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
that mental issues in our schools is is
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
growing and it's an issue that has to be
 
00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:46.430 align:start position:0%
growing and it's an issue that has to be
addressed

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
is this bill opening up the door however
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
to allow a classroom teacher to take on
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
some of these responsibilities that
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
they're not trained for
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's my question and how
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
how can we find out where that line is
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
so that we don't end up with
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
teachers saying well you know I I was
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
just trying to address this at any basic
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
component of an adequate education
 
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
and then somebody come back and say well
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have the skill to do
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
that yeah so let's answer your question
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
and it really is an essential question
 
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
and I'll say a couple things about it
 
00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:23.630 align:start position:0%
and I'll say a couple things about it
um

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
I think education and treatment are
 
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely different and there should be
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
a bright line between the two
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
and the school psycho psychologists is
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
someone who I think is there to help
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
students find treatment
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
this is about educational understanding
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
what mental health is
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
about educational understanding
 
00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
some of the kind of issues that you may
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
notice in yourself or in others and to
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
give you a way of of go you know each of
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
those topics there to understand what
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
psychological impacts may be about that
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
if someone
 
00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:04.130 align:start position:0%
if someone
exhibits

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
exhibits
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
a condition
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
or feels that they are trouble by
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
condition that's not for a teacher
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
Heavens no
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
um it's for the school psychologist
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
school psychologist is not going to be
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
able to teach how many thousands of
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
students or hundreds of students of a
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
curriculum in the classroom so I I think
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
I agree with you if you if you feel that
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
necessary to add a line here that says
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
that curriculum shall not involve nor
 
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
shall teachers be involved in the in the
 
00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.349 align:start position:0%
shall teachers be involved in the in the
um

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
advising or treating of students for
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
mental health issues of course
 
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
but you know it's like we have health
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
education I mean there are physical
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
therapists right you know that somebody
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
in the football teams gets hurt physical
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
therapist but they're not doing the
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
health education for him so I think it's
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
kind of an equivalent there Mr chairman
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much either questions
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
represent Myler
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Aladdin
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I want
 
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
to kind of follow up on on the previous
 
00:42:05.339 --> 00:42:06.890 align:start position:0%
to kind of follow up on on the previous
question

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for bringing this
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill before us today
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
how do you respond to those who say
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
mental health is not should not be an
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
issue within schools you kind of
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
indicated that you know teachers aren't
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
qualified to be mental health
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
professionals Etc so how do you respond
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
to that to the senator
 
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
bro come thanks for the question and you
 
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.990 align:start position:0%
bro come thanks for the question and you
know

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.890 align:start position:0%
know
um

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
whether we wanted to be in the schools
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
mental health issues are affecting our
 
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.950 align:start position:0%
mental health issues are affecting our
students

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
and as an educator
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
no matter what really you know we're
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
talking about health education but any
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
kind of education I think we can our
 
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
idea is to provide the tools in adequate
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
education that a student is going to
 
00:42:56.579 --> 00:42:58.190 align:start position:0%
education that a student is going to
need

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
um to succeed academically but also with
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
life skills that's why we do outdoor
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
recreation that's why we do Wellness
 
00:43:06.359 --> 00:43:07.849 align:start position:0%
recreation that's why we do Wellness
right

00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that it's inevitable but
 
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
also I as I suggested earlier the school
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
is a very good place to provide this
 
00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:17.210 align:start position:0%
is a very good place to provide this
education

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
and you know I we heard very strongly
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
from students that the teaching that is
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
being done now under existing rules is
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
not adequate it in some cases we heard
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
from students who in their
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
entire time in school had never had any
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
instruction in mental health and
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
precious little
 
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
in other kinds of health or Wellness
 
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.770 align:start position:0%
in other kinds of health or Wellness
so

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I think we can improve that without
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
expecting teachers to be experts in
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment but certainly
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
teachers know how to how to teach if
 
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
they're given the curricular resources
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
that they that they need
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cascadden thank
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you senator for
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking through this as a lens
 
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
that there is another it's another bill
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
to add another social service within the
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
public school system and that's how I'm
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
worried about it being received on that
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
end because the school day has not
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
gotten any longer and God knows in the
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
last 10 15 years how many more
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
requirements have been put on public
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
school staff and then transition that to
 
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
an area that is low socioeconomic where
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
a psychologist and a guidance counselor
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
is not always on staff or is shared with
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
multiple buildings
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking where is this going to be
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
implemented so so I'm thinking okay one
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
you need to be able to have access to a
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
psychologist who works with children or
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
I mean that the standards say one
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
Elementary School can have up to 500
 
00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
students in a day of 500 students that
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
counselor has a zero type plus they're
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
not trained as therapists like a school
 
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.329 align:start position:0%
not trained as therapists like a school
psychologist

00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
psychologist
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that raises a question for me as to
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
how can how how do you propose that this
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
be done in schools who don't have the
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
funding for the bare minimums of
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
optional Services based on statute I
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
mean School psychologists and school
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors are optional
 
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
Services by Statute
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I I have that question
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then I'd rather I have to tell you
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'd rather see a bill that requires all
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
teachers to be trained in youth Mental
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
Health First Aid
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
um yeah but yeah how would we staff that
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
in a yeah you know I just see where and
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
the state should provide that that
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
training thank you and oh I'm sorry
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
you know I I
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
I you know lifetime I don't know there's
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
a question but how would this happen 44
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
years in the classroom you know and uh
 
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
and um you know worked on education in
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
my 14 years up here and I think you're
 
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
pointing to a a real kind of struggle
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
about how how our what capacity to our
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
schools have to deliver education and um
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
I would like to note that given what we
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
know about what's happening with our
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
youth definitely we've got to do
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
something yeah it definitely and I think
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
what's important about this is just
 
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
again to reiterate that we are not
 
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.809 align:start position:0%
again to reiterate that we are not
expecting

00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
expecting
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
a creation of a treatment system
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
we're not expecting schools for this
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
bill to become a Social Service Agency
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
we are saying schools do what you do
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
teach students so they have the facts
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
about mental health about wellness and
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
about these factors
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
um about drug and alcohol use about
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
violence of various of various sorts
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
about suicide per se or you know or or
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
really the positive sides of Wellness
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know I mean the things you can do to
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
feel better you know and um uh and and I
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
think that that's a curricular issue
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
and I wanted very much as I said to
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
structure this so we are not asking
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
schools with unfunded mandate to hire
 
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
lots of new teachers to train them to
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
make them go through this and that I
 
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
think that this model works very well if
 
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
you provide teachers with a really good
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
online curriculum and again I say you
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
know did meet Mero is just what I know
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
about because I want them played around
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
on their website but there are others
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
you can find out there and you'll see
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
this is a they can provide a good
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
curriculum and um that's why but what's
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
important is it goes through the funnel
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
which I have full confidence in can
 
00:47:49.609 --> 00:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
develop you know and post the model
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
curriculum and they're willing to put
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
some effort into it with a hundred
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars you know to make sure
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
that we get what can work for our
 
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.589 align:start position:0%
that we get what can work for our
teachers

00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
um I think clearly we all know the
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis in the state we've
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
got to do a whole lot more about all
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of services and so on and that's a
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
big issue and I will say the governor is
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
working hard on that one too but here in
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
the schools we can we can do this I
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
think this can work
 
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes go ahead
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
um so is the intent of the bill to add
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
this in adequacy so that it
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
follows that adequacy formula as a yeah
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
so if you're part of adequate education
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
yeah if you look at the um if you look
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
at the bill on um
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
you see the existing language yep the
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
sound wellness and as the chair pointed
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
out well and had they had rules that was
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
you know there's some talk about mental
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
health but sound Wellness but then
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
adding mental health explicitly there
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
and then a little bit further down
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
Health wellness and mental health
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
so in in um
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
those those places it what it does is it
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
Keys up
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
that their new spirit curriculum
 
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
then it needs to be taught and we're
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
going to provide you with the tools you
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
need to do that so that that's the way
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
the bill structured
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
okay luno and then represent cordiello
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
very much Senator
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
um why did the um I was looking at the
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
at the bills amended by the Senate and
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill is introduced and um
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
and given that it's got a I think a long
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
slate of bipartisan you know sponsors
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
why was um why was the original section
 
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.170 align:start position:0%
why was um why was the original section
one

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
um removed from the bilicas that looks
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
like it provided a lot of context for
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
this well thanks for the question and
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know findings are findings they
 
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
don't go into statute and um the
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
committee thought that really the heart
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill is in the list of topics
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
that you're asking the Department of
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
Education to include when they make
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
their rules and you know also in that
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
those findings uh since the time I wrote
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
the Bill
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
who are based on the 2019 risk use
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
Behavior survey guess what about three
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
weeks ago the 2021
 
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
numbers came out and things are pretty
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
much the same kind of difference so I
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
think it made some some sense that you
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
know the findings
 
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:22.730 align:start position:0%
know the findings
um

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
were seen as a little extraneous and I
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
think that also the Senate education you
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
know Senator Lyon Senator General were
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about not to be
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
distracted in some ways by topics and
 
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
the findings and to because here's what
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
we want to actually be done and here it
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think most importantly was the
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
parental consent
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
that those were the issues that became
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
the core of the bill and the rest of it
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
kind of fell away there you go represent
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
cordiall yes thank you Mr chair um if
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
it's okay I sort of have a two-part
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
question about two different phrases
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
here so um thank you senator for taking
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
um on the first page of the actual bill
 
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
line 28 there is a phrase
 
00:51:09.049 --> 00:51:09.059 align:start position:0%
at the parents expense and this is in
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
regards to if a parent opts out in
 
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.130 align:start position:0%
regards to if a parent opts out in
writing

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh um in objection to some material they
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.849 align:start position:0%
have to
um

00:51:18.849 --> 00:51:18.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
requires them an alternative agreed upon
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
by the school district and the parents
 
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.130 align:start position:0%
by the school district and the parents
so

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
the parent if
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
if a parent UPS their child out they're
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
required to provide a different
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
curriculum at their at their expense and
 
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't this place a barrier to those of
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
a lower income that's a motivation for
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
that that's that's existing statute
 
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's this bill doesn't change that at
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
all okay well maybe we need to change
 
00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:47.210 align:start position:0%
all okay well maybe we need to change
there

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
um okay so then maybe I'm new at this so
 
00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.829 align:start position:0%
um okay so then maybe I'm new at this so
just

00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
um is this is the same the case with to
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
the extent practicable on page two then
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
because that's where the school district
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
shall make curriculum course materials
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
available to parents or legal Guardians
 
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
my question was going to be in what sort
 
00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
of situation would it be impractical to
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
provide these materials but if this also
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
is an existing statute I guess that goes
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
beyond this hearing and
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
yeah but let us know that what's
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
important here is that you know the
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
Senate felt that it was important to
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that parents knew that as they
 
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
do in general in health education but
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
particularly here to make sure parents
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
know that's why the bullet is there
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
here's the existing and we put it here's
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
the existing language
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
that protects parents and their rights
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
and just to button it up by saying that
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
also includes Mental Health
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
so but that is existing statute I'm sure
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
the chairman can tell you the many many
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
years in which we struggled to come up
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
with that language and and extend
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
practicable and why that phrase and um
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but it's existing represent
 
00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.510 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but it's existing represent
Belcher

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.190 align:start position:0%
for being here
um

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
so uh just to briefly follow up on rip
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
portiello and her question yeah the the
 
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
expense of a new curriculum that may be
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
existing language but this new
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
requirement would be applicable under
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
that existing language would that be
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
correct So It ultimately would then
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
require a parent to substitute their own
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
curriculum if they opt out okay like
 
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
anything else perfect we want to provide
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
that up top but they gotta you know they
 
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
gotta they gotta pass the interest
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
they've got to demonstrate they have an
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
adequate education so excellent if I may
 
00:53:43.849 --> 00:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
do my original question
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
um the new language specifically calls
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
for the teaching
 
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
on line 17 Page One mental health coping
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
strategies including personal practices
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
um would you agree that that constitutes
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
the practice of mental health within the
 
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.510 align:start position:0%
the practice of mental health within the
classroom

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question you see
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
that section is the things that deal we
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
ought to consider in making their rules
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
and selecting the curriculum so that's
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
why I entrust this to doe to figure out
 
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.069 align:start position:0%
why I entrust this to doe to figure out
what

00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know I mean these are these are good
 
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
questions it's good to have coping
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
skills huh
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh and so
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
um this is a a way as we do and you know
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
as in physical health education right I
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
mean we teach student skills how to keep
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
themselves physically hit and um so I I
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
am entrusting doe here to look at this
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
kind of laundry list and figure out okay
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
how do how do we
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
put online a curriculum that touches on
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
his issues and then of course a teacher
 
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
is going to have the freedom and this
 
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
local school board to decide how to use
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
that curriculum and how to apply it to
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do in the
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
classrooms if I made just one more one
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
last question um
 
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
he brought up physical education and I I
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
totally agree and that's a that's a
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
solid thing we always need to be
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
teaching students but would you agree
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
that unlike physical education
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
requirements mental health requirements
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
is much more liable to be bumping up
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
against ideological and potential
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
religious objections that parents could
 
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.690 align:start position:0%
religious objections that parents could
have

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
well thank you um
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
I worry about it and that's why that's
 
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
why the solution that Senator gender and
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
Lang came in here is just to make it
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
make it sure that that Stu the parents
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
that may have some concerns about that
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
to see that and um and I think the
 
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will be very
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that as as well and um
 
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.130 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that as as well and um
so

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
yes I mean let's let's do it so the
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
parents can understand that this is this
 
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
is this is serving we call it it's
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
mental health and
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
but it is education and it's education
 
00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
that we is believed will help your we
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
help your children out
 
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
um with their life skills
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
and with their knowledge base I mean
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stigma around mental
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
health right there's a lot of autonomous
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
information around it autonomous
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
information around alcohol and drug
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
abuse a lot of
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
maybe not enough information about
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
Suicidal Thoughts so anyhow I mean I I
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
Let's help our Let's Help the students
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
out and um I really again as I can't
 
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
emphasize how much I trust commissary
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
double and the doe staff to figure out
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
on a curriculum that's appropriate to
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
help our our young people out thank you
 
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
for that are the questions from the
 
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.910 align:start position:0%
for that are the questions from the
committee

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's yes representative Cascade
 
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
just to get your perspective Senator
 
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.230 align:start position:0%
just to get your perspective Senator
um

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
if it's an added curriculum
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
to the school
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
I mean where do you draw the line on
 
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.609 align:start position:0%
I mean where do you draw the line on
what's

00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
parents should be doing versus what the
 
00:56:59.809 --> 00:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
school would be doing do you see any
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
well that's the question and I mean that
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is kind of always
 
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
I mean in almost any form of Education
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
that's always an issue because you want
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
parents to be involved and um and
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
parents want to be involved and uh
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
and um you know you want these people to
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
be mutually reinforcing and informative
 
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.890 align:start position:0%
be mutually reinforcing and informative
um

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill is a fairly light
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
touch by incorporating mental health as
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
an articulated aspect of health
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
education so it's not saying replace
 
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
health education it's an aspect of it
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
right and within that context
 
00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:41.210 align:start position:0%
right and within that context
um teachers

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
um teachers
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
through the doe kind of guidance because
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
of what is going to be the online
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
curriculum that's made available to them
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
can develop in the context of the local
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
schools the appropriate balance there
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I don't see in some ways I
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
mean you ask great questions because in
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
some ways but it's not I'm just trying
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
to not a whole lot different from what
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
we face in all areas of the curriculum
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
just about lately yes
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you again
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question would um
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
would you object to um maybe and I know
 
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:18.740 align:start position:0%
we're executing this later this morning
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
maybe adding the term other or the
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
condition Eating Disorders to somewhere
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
on line 16.
 
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
which which is the area where it lists a
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know I I uh I I obviously it's an
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
important aspect and for young people
 
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.670 align:start position:0%
important aspect and for young people
certainly

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
um as I said I this became I went to
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
sources an educational source to make
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
this list it may not be comprehensive if
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
the committee thinks that it's good to
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
articulate that
 
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I suspect health professionals would
 
00:58:59.210 --> 00:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
think that's a pretty good idea but you
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
know I the wisdom of this committee look
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
let me just say Mr chairman
 
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:06.140 align:start position:0%
I hope we pass the Bill okay
 
00:59:09.609 --> 00:59:09.619 align:start position:0%
we're gonna help our spoon salad
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
the committee feels that there's some
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
some things that need to be done to
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
increase your comfort level
 
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
um then I'm I'm you know I'm certainly
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
going to be open Senator do you want to
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
read the only reason I'm asking is
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
because I think there's two numbers on
 
00:59:24.049 --> 00:59:24.059 align:start position:0%
the back of student ID cards one of them
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
is The Suicide Prevention Hotline and
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
the second one may be eating disorders
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
hey so so I mean I'm comfortable with
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
the bill as is but I think it should be
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
consistent I appreciate that that is in
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
our mission and thank you and and I do
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
have one last one for you because this
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
is something that you as the sponsor
 
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
decided to do you decided to put this in
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
193 E2 adequacy in our statutes why did
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
you not opt to put it in 189 10 studies
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
where we already mentioned health
 
00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.289 align:start position:0%
where we already mentioned health
education

00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:57.299 align:start position:0%
education

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%

speak in support of SB 151
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
earlier this session I came before the
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee to speak in support of a
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
similar bill hb505 which the committee
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
then retained while we still support HP
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
505 we believe that the differences in
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
SB 151 May successfully address concerns
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
the committee had regarding the prior
 
01:01:17.339 --> 01:01:18.589 align:start position:0%
the committee had regarding the prior
bill

01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
despite mental health education being
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
required by administrative rule the Nami
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has heard from several
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
students who indicate that they've had
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
zero mental health education within the
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
health education program in their
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
schools considering our current youth
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis this education must
 
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
be provided
 
01:01:36.049 --> 01:01:36.059 align:start position:0%
one in six U.S youth ages 6 to 17
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
experience a mental health disorder each
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%

further emerging New Hampshire data

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
grade students from 2019 to 2021. I
 
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
won't go over those exact numbers but
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
they are there
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
by codifying these adequate education
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
requirements SB 151 would ensure that
 
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
every school provides this critical
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
with regards to HP 505 the committee was
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
concerned with the use of the word
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and that the bill did not
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
provide specific guidance on what topics
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
should be included SB 151 however does
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
not use the word comprehensive and
 
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
provides a list of specific mental
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
health subjects to be addressed in the
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
curriculum additionally this bill
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
specifically includes an opt-out option
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
for parents and families who find the
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
content objectionable
 
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
to improve the well-being and future of
 
01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Youth and Young adults we
 
01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
need all hands on deck including the
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
state schools by requiring mental health
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
education and statute this bill is one
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
tool that can be used to help address
 
01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:38.579 align:start position:0%
the youth Mental Health crisis New
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is experiencing therefore we
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote OTP on SB 151
 
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
taking a question
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
um I was reading the comments from the
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
hearing in the Senate and Holly Stevens
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
testified behalf of your organization
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
there and
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
um Senator Ward asked uh how much time
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
would be proper for a course or lecture
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
like this and how over how long a basis
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
which would this be is this one year one
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
class one quarter one semester and the
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
response was that they'd find out and
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
get back to the committee so I wondered
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
if they'd done that I'm not sure if if
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
Holly did that I can connect with her
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
and ask though and if we have that
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation I can pass it on to you
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%

01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%

thank you for being here
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
um as an organization that has expertise
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the matter of mental health I just
 
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask if if there would be any
 
01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
reason for concern
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
over calling to teach children
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
specifically skills to recognize
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
personal mental health issues in
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
themselves and peers
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
kind of sounds like maybe
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
self-diagnosing and diagnosing each
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
other and does that introduce any
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
possibility of um social contagion and
 
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.309 align:start position:0%
possibility of um social contagion and
such

01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question I don't
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
personally have any concerns regarding
 
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
that I know from my personal life a lot
 
01:04:03.289 --> 01:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
of people who lived with mental illness
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
for a long time were not able to
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
recognize it and pursue treatment
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know what they were
 
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
going through uh I
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
if they have the tools to uh recognize
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
that and then pursue professional help
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
they would receive that professional
 
01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
help thank you
 
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:21.660 align:start position:0%

um phrase that we're just talking about
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
on line 19 recognizing personal mental
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
01:04:36.359 --> 01:04:36.890 align:start position:0%
health issues
um

01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
we have a chapter in statute about
 
01:04:43.089 --> 01:04:43.099 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention education
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
and part of that includes education of
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
faculty and students and
 
01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:53.339 align:start position:0%

to student education includes warning
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
signs of mental disorders and suicide so
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
how is that that's already in statute
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
different than what we're talking about
 
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.130 align:start position:0%
different than what we're talking about
here

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:10.140 align:start position:0%

seen the statute so I can only speak to
 
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
it based off your question of course
 
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
mental health disorders go beyond
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
depression and suicide this includes a
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
more exhaustive list of what would be
 
01:05:24.359 --> 01:05:25.549 align:start position:0%
more exhaustive list of what would be
covered

01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
covered

chairman and honor honorable members of
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
the House Education committee for the
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
record my name is Anne-Marie Banfield
 
01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'm a parental rights Advocate focused
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
on academic excellence and education
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
just making sure okay
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
um SB 151 would add mental health to the
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
definition of an adequate education
 
01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
by the way I posed this while everyone
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
would agree that a good mental health
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
would be priority for all of us for our
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
students what exactly does this mean in
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
our schools for instance does it mean
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
that you have good mental health if you
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
are religious because there are studies
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
out there that would suggest that
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
spirituality and religious beliefs
 
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
contribute to good mental health
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
would that be included in the mental
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
health standards would it be excluded
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
from Nami mental health benefits of
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
religion religion gives people Something
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
to Believe In provides a sense of
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
structure and typically offers a group
 
01:06:52.849 --> 01:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
of people to connect with over similar
 
01:06:52.859 --> 01:06:54.529 align:start position:0%
of people to connect with over similar
beliefs

01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
so there is a there is a component I
 
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
guess the question would be would that
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
be included in the standards or would
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
they be excluded
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
who will teach mental health in class A
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
teacher who has never been educated or
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
trained in the field of Mental Health
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
nothing in this law describes who is
 
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
qualified to teach children in the area
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
of Mental Health mental health addresses
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
serious issues like depression anxiety
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
and even suicide are they subjects left
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
up to those without a doctorate in child
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
psychology shouldn't you include the
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
credentials of someone
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
who is educated and clinically trained
 
01:07:32.809 --> 01:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
in the field of child psychology
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
would you want a teacher covering the
 
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
subject of cancer in a public school
 
01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:39.299 align:start position:0%
even the nurse school nurse wouldn't be
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
qualified to cover that subject
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
we have an illiteracy problem in our
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
schools and now there is an attempt to
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
shift more Focus away from mourning the
 
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:50.339 align:start position:0%
core academic subjects what will take
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
the place of mental health education in
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
our schools what will this be replaced
 
01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:57.299 align:start position:0%
by will the Arts or Civics education be
 
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299 align:start position:0%
eliminated or diluted again
 
01:08:02.569 --> 01:08:02.579 align:start position:0%
there have been attempts to deal with
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
mental health of students in our public
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
schools and some of it has been a
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
literal disaster
 
01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
I remind you of the deaf education that
 
01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
was taught in Columbine High School
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
years ago where they thought that they
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
could help children who were struggling
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
with loved ones who had died
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
mental health education had children
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
writing their obituaries visiting the
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
local morgue to see dead people and
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
telling children about what it was like
 
01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
after they died
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
when 2020 covered the story one of the
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
students talked about how she was led to
 
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
contemplate suicide
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
you can do Google death education 2020
 
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
in Columbine to watch the story it's
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
still on YouTube
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
several years ago in Indiana school
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
administrators administered mental
 
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
health screenings to students the mental
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
health screening tool was called teen
 
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.769 align:start position:0%
health screening tool was called teen
screen

01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
screen
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
one mother reported that her
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
fifteen-year-old daughter was physically
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
upset after taking the mental health
 
01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:57.769 align:start position:0%
upset after taking the mental health
assessment

01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
when her daughter came home she asked
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
her parents what OCD and social anxiety
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
disorder was the people at school told
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
her daughter that she was mentally ill
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
based on a computer test that took 10
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
minutes to answer
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
at that time no parent consented
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
consented to the assessment
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
parents the parents wanted to know why
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
their daughter was flagged for being
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
mentally ill here is what the parent
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
reported her daughter answered no when
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
she was asked if she went out a lot
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
this was what a question on on the
 
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
assessment the daughter answered no
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
because she wasn't allowed to go out on
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
school nights another question was do
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
you ever feel anxious or nervous when
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
you are in a with a group of your peers
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
she answered yes because she was she had
 
01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
to get up in front of her class to give
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
a book report so she got nervous many
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
people come here before this committee
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
and are very nervous
 
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't make a mentally ill
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
why would a school district give
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
children their an assessment a screening
 
01:09:59.810 --> 01:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
like this according to Harvard Medical
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
School and author of the truth about
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
drug companies by Marsha angel
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
it was just a way to put more people on
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs the pharmaceutical
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry was behind the
 
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
teen screen
 
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
parents through the school district but
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
you can see how sometimes this process
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
can be corrupted and that can happen
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
when mental health screenings are
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
administered at school by people who
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't know who are not properly educated
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
or trained
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
and now we have the same thing happening
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
in our schools in New Hampshire mental
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
health data on New Hampshire students
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
are now shared with evaluators so they
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
can report back to the federal
 
01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.250 align:start position:0%
can report back to the federal
government

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State Antioch University and
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
now Keen State have all had access to
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
mental health records on New Hampshire
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
students without informed consent by the
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
student or their parents this violates
 
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
basic mental health codes of ethics
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
when a parent takes their child to a
 
01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
licensed child psychologist for an
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
assessment or treatment the child
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
psychologist must follow a strict code
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
of ethics that includes informed consent
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
before assessing trading or disclosing
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
the sensitive data
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
if a child enters a public school in New
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school counselors and school
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
social workers have made their
 
01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:17.060 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
available to the staff of those
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
universities for reporting purposes
 
01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
according to their own contracts with
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Schools they're asking
 
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:29.300 align:start position:0%
for the child's social security number
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
political affiliations
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
and religious beliefs just to name a few
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
it is shocking that many of those in the
 
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
mental health field are ignoring basic
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
guidelines but they are
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
it was finally finally to follow up or
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
to conclude it was before this commit
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee a few weeks ago that many of
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
you asked how Civics education was
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
narrowed down or even eliminated in some
 
01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
of our schools maybe the answer lies
 
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
with the laws that are passed that Force
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
schools to eliminate instruction in the
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
core academic subjects
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I urge you to vote itl
 
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
on SB 151
 
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.709 align:start position:0%
on SB 151
um

01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest contributors to the
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
mental health problem amongst teens in
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
in children in school was the school
 
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.610 align:start position:0%
in children in school was the school
shutdowns

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
shutdowns
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
I worked with parents across the state
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
trying begging pleading School
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
administrators to open up the schools
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
I worked with parents who were writing
 
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner and copying me about
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
serious mental health issues suicidal
 
01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.270 align:start position:0%
serious mental health issues suicidal
attempts

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
attempts
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
by some of these kids
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
because the schools were shut down by
 
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
the individuals you want to put in
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
charge of their Mental Health
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know what works gym class
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
address bullying the things that you
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
guys have worked on a lot of that makes
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
it for a good environment within the
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
and finally I was talking to an
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
individual driving here about a book
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
that because books are so controversial
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
in schools right now there's a book in a
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
school and um
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's bad it's bad it's very dark
 
01:13:11.159 --> 01:13:12.530 align:start position:0%
it's bad it's bad it's very dark
and

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
um talks about trauma kids that have
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
gone through trauma and and we both
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
agreed that if a child who's gone
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
through trauma reads this book
 
01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's going to reignite trauma there are
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
things that are problems in these
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
schools right now and and and and so my
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
concern is you're asking people who are
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
not trained and educated clinically
 
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
trained in the field of child psychology
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
to once again delve into this topic I
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening thank you very
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
much other questions yes represent
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
you for being here and taking my
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
question you identified yourself as a
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
parental rights advocate so are you less
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill after it came out
 
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
of the Senate with the amendment
 
01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:00.260 align:start position:0%
beginning on line 24 which
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
clarifies that parents have the right to
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
object to the material
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
I do I think certainly it's it's a it's
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
a Improvement
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
um I talked to the Senators and I had
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
and when this was in committee
 
01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:15.770 align:start position:0%
and when this was in committee
um

01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
certainly any time that you can make
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
something transparent it helps but I
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
think you know I think either
 
01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd when he was first
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
questioning Senator Waters brought up
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
some excellent points representative you
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
brought up some excellent points I think
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
that this is such a big issue and please
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
understand that I think that mental
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
health amongst our kids is extremely
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
important but I've seen the bad side too
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
I've seen you know the problems that
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
come from good intention teachers or
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
individuals working in the schools
 
01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
who do not have that expertise and I do
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
work with PhD level child psychologists
 
01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
and I learn from them and I know the
 
01:14:59.689 --> 01:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
dangers because a lot of them get the
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
kids out of the school and into their
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
private practice to help these kids who
 
01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
who dealt with trauma so you bring up
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
trauma in class you know you never know
 
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
where this conversation is going to go
 
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
in a classroom if you if you say Okay
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
teacher I want you to teach mental
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
health you don't know what kind of
 
01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
subjects are going to come up what you
 
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
know are you going to Define that for a
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
teacher and you're going to say you have
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
to strict to state to the script and and
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
suicide comes up or something traumatic
 
01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
comes up where does that discussion go
 
01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
it's it's very difficult I know I
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
probably rambled on about that yeah I do
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
think that that improved it sorry
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I'm just
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
curious because
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
it seems like over the years through
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
education we've we've tried to implement
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
various programs over different periods
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
of time are you aware of any Trends as
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
far as tracking students mental health
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
as we have implemented programs that
 
01:15:59.689 --> 01:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
attempt to address these issues such as
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning and other
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
things and how that trend line over time
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
has affected students
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
um what do you mean by tracking as far
 
01:16:09.179 --> 01:16:09.950 align:start position:0%
um what do you mean by tracking as far
as

01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
um it basically has mental health gotten
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
better worse stayed the same over time
 
01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know that answer I don't know I
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
think you would have to look at
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
independent peer-reviewed studies to get
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
that information I think sometimes we I
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
think especially in education sorry but
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information that's
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
brought that's not peer-reviewed or
 
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
independent and so as as legislators I
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
would caution you I caution everybody
 
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
and I think in the field of medicine
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's always going to be peer-reviewed
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
and independent but a lot of times what
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
comes into education is not peer
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
reviewed it's not independent so for
 
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
instance the report that has to go back
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
to the federal government on on the
 
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
mtssb program that's in the school right
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
now that's our peer-reviewed that's not
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
independent it looks more like a sales
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
brochure on the mtssb program and yet
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
um all that data that's coming in to to
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
these evaluators
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
parents don't know that their child's
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
mental health has been shared with with
 
01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
um so you know I see so many problems
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
already that I you know unless again
 
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
this is specifically defined and you you
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
you go through this and you you want to
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
add things it's got to be well defined
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
who gets to teach this
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
um you know because these subjects are
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to come up you know somebody you
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
know representative Luna brought up um
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders I can tell you that
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
that there are girls that you just bring
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
up that subject it plants a seed oh I
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
need to lose weight
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
oh I can go make myself throw up in the
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
bathroom and lose weight I mean we had
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
the survey years ago that asked kids on
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
these surveys
 
01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.490 align:start position:0%
these surveys
did

01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
did you or have you ever sniffed glue to
 
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
get high guess what all these kids were
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
learning now that they get to get high
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
from sniffing glue off of a survey so
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
you you you teach what you're trying to
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
do to help can oftentimes backfire and
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
that's my concern thank you I don't know
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
if that answered your question sorry
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
my question I actually have two
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
um as a preface I spent a 40 40-year
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
career as a dietitian specializing in
 
01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to say this as a
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
question so I'm just going to state that
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is not factual that talking about
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
eating disorders creates them
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
my second part is a question
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
are you aware that it is widely
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that not talking about
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
suicide increases the risk of suicide
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
I I'm not aware of that particular but
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
again who's talking about it in this
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
instance I would be you're talking about
 
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
a teacher so and what is what's the
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
conversation because if you go back and
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
you look at Columbine they were talking
 
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
about that and then it led that student
 
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
to to then contemplate suicide I mean
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
that that was the that was a fact so I
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
don't know that's your conclusion that
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
that was perfect that's not a known fact
 
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
I do have one more question and I'm just
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
going to parallel the question to my
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
experience as a elementary school
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
teacher at Elementary School principal
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
and administrator uh over the years in
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
Maine in Alaska
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
I observed that one of the trends that
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
we had back then was ADD ADHD
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
and teachers when they heard about ADHD
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
this kid's hyper so we got to throw
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
another pill in them is this the type of
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
activity that could could come about if
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have these people that are
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
dealing and trying to deal with a
 
01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
curriculum dealing with mental health
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
could we have another
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know direction that we're having uh
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
information conveyed to Children which
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
maybe needed to be done through a school
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
psychologist rather than and parent
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
rather than through the teacher in a
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
classroom I'm a little bit concerned of
 
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
where we're going with this that's
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
exactly when you were speaking earlier
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what my concern was
 
01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:34.970 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what my concern was
because

01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's not that you know I'm opposed to
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
helping a child with their mental health
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
I think we can all I know everybody on
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
this committee is concerned about that
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's more about who we're putting in
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
charge and and I do work with PhD level
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
child psychologists I don't comment this
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
with just me I look at what they are
 
01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
saying what they are telling me and
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
and you're absolutely right I mean I
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put myself in front of a child
 
01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
and and even with some training and
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
think that I can do what they can do so
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
yes I I mean I think that there's a
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why they are clinically
 
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
trained there's a reason why they have a
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
code of ethics uh if they if they if
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
they don't follow their code of ethics
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know as a parent I can go and I can
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
ask for their license to be removed I
 
01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
can go to licensing board
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
um how do you deal with somebody who's
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
going in that direction in a classroom
 
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
that may put a child in danger and it's
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
happened we have examples where this has
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
happened so it's not like something you
 
01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
know that I'm making up it we we have
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
examples of where that has happened
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
um you know you hope that that's not
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen and you in you and I do
 
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
believe that most of these teachers have
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
their best interest at heart but I can
 
01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
have their best interests at heart but I
 
01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
can tell you that I don't know what a
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
child psychologist knows
 
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions thank you
 
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:21.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
House Education committee thank you so
 
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
much for having me here today
 
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
my name is Laura Lee Godfrey and I am 18
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
years old from Portsmouth New Hampshire
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
I am the chair of the governor's youth
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
advisory Council on substance misuse and
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
prevention our Council advises the
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
governor on New Hampshire's opioid
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
crisis from a youth perspective after
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
collaborating with my peers on this
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
Council I helped author this legislation
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
with Senator Waters to address a
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
pressing need within New Hampshire and
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to ask you to vote ought
 
01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
to pass with Amendment on SB 151
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
so last winter my best friend had her
 
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
first panic attack while I was driving
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the car with her I immediately pulled
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
over to the side of the road neither of
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
us had any experience dealing with a
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
panic attack before and as I clutched
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
her hand I frantically tapped out a
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
Google search to help her and I did tell
 
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
my best friend that I wasn't ignoring
 
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
her through her panic attack but instead
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
looking up how to help her
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
my friend is just one of many teenagers
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
undergoing what's been called a mental
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
health crisis in the United States
 
01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
countless young adults face
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
deteriorating mental health in the midst
 
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
of neurodivergence conflict or high
 
01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
familial or academic demands and all my
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
friends have struggled in one way or
 
01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
another bottling mental health issues
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
that they don't know how to respond to
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they simply lack the knowledge on
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
how to take care of themselves
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a New Hampshire student I've never
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
once been taught how to take care of my
 
01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
mental health and in a situation where
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
my best friend needed my help I did not
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
know how to help her
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
I posed this question to my peers from
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
across the state in the governor's
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
Council and across a range of public
 
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
private and Charter Schools few of us
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
actually underwent mental health
 
01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:17.209 align:start position:0%
actually underwent mental health
education

01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:17.219 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
our students met with Governor sununa
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
where we mutually agreed this issue
 
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed like us Governor
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
sununu is concerned about mental health
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and he encouraged us to
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
write a report summarizing our findings
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
I emailed that reports the committee
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
this morning and I also have passed
 
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
around several physical copies as well
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
and our recommendations concluded that
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
legislative action was necessary
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
right now New Hampshire's only inclusion
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
of mental health education is in
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
recommended guidelines from 2007. they
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
are not required they're outdated and
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're simply not being taught to
 
01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:56.780 align:start position:0%
students that needs to change
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
sp-151 can improve this
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
if we look to other states like Illinois
 
01:25:03.169 --> 01:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
in Prior New Hampshire legislation
 
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
similar educational initiatives have
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
been tackled without infringing upon
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities when drafting this
 
01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:11.699 align:start position:0%
legislation our Council specifically
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
worked as to not pass an unfunded
 
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
mandate to our schools and to our
 
01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:16.669 align:start position:0%
mandate to our schools and to our
teachers

01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
in this legislation the Department of
 
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
Education can Define mental health as a
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
characteristic of an essential education
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
and write model curriculum for school
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
implementation with the doe support in
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
establishing clear-cut competencies
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
lesson plans and resources schools will
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
already have the tools they need to
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
engage students
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate amendment to SB 151fn
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
eliminates the findings which is
 
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
non-essential to the intents of this
 
01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
legislation and it also reinforces that
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
parents can opt out of this instruction
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
for their children as is the case in
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
existing statute and I am in strong
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
support of this amendment
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
now this policy isn't a Panacea it's not
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
the Silver Bullet that's going to end
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
mental health disorders as we know them
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
updating these standards from 2007 to
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
2023 will should stat students on the
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
path to being better prepared citizens
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
and leaders by empowering youth through
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
education and resource accessibility New
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can prevent slides in the
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and break the stigma
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
around Mental Health
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
our state can do its part to keep youth
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
safe and healthy
 
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
if this policy can help just one girl
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
pulled over to the side of the road with
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
her own or with her friends mental
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
health it'll be worth it
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration and I
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
humbly ask you about ought to pass with
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment on SB 151 I will take any
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much questions
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
represent paternal
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
presenting this legislation it's quite a
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
daunting task I appreciate it I have a
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
question as a high school student what
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
you must have a vision of what this
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
education would look like
 
01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.750 align:start position:0%
education would look like
and

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:58.450 --> 01:26:58.460 align:start position:0%
I'll start there
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely thank you so much for
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
your question so as outlined in our
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
health education report we do have a
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
vision of certain aspects that we want
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
taught mainly certain types of mental
 
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
disorders that aren't currently taught
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
as well as mental health coming
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
strategies but there are more specifics
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
in the report that I emailed to you
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead how early
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
um in your education do you think this
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum would begin
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
I think sooner rather than later but
 
01:27:29.689 --> 01:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
definitely should be an essential part
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
of a high school education for sure
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.120 --> 01:28:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
interesting

01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Emma savini I am
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
the children's Behavioral Health policy
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
coordinator at new Futures new Futures
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
is a non-partisan non-profit
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
organization that Advocates educates and
 
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
collaborates for the health and wellness
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
of all Granite Staters we are here in
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
strong support of house Senate Bill 151
 
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
today because it would emphasize the
 
01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:22.139 align:start position:0%
importance of mental health through
 
01:28:24.169 --> 01:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
Youth and teach them basic tools and
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
techniques that could help reduce the
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
stressors they face in their everyday
 
01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.610 align:start position:0%
stressors they face in their everyday
lives

01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
as you just heard so eloquently put by
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
this the young woman who assisted
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill teens are facing a
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis and they don't
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
really know what to do in certain
 
01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.610 align:start position:0%
really know what to do in certain
circumstances

01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
having this is a part of an adequate
 
01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
education we give them those tools to
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
adequately address
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
those emergent circumstances that pop up
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
when you're driving in a car when you're
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
walking between class and it also will
 
01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
give students the ability to have an
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
open conversation with trusted adults in
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
their lifetime in their life to reach
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
out for help so that they can be
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
connected with those mental health
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
professionals to provide treatment when
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate I want to be so clear
 
01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
this bill is not asking teachers to
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
provide mental health treatment to
 
01:29:15.649 --> 01:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
students this is simply asking that
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
teachers provide students with education
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
about what mental health is and give
 
01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
them the tools to adequately address the
 
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
stressors in their life
 
01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
by giving them the tools to either reach
 
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
out for further treatment from a mental
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
health provider or by giving them the
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
coping strategies they can use in a
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
day-to-day life just like deep breathing
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
techniques or something similar
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
as we've heard this bill would
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
um give the Department of Education the
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
ability to change its rules to better
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
address what this looks like and so any
 
01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.050 align:start position:0%
address what this looks like and so any
um

01:29:53.050 --> 01:29:53.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
specifics that may not be addressed in
 
01:29:57.410 --> 01:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
this legislature could be addressed in
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
those rules for instance who is teaching
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
this curriculum and those types of
 
01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:03.110 align:start position:0%
this curriculum and those types of
questions

01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:03.890 align:start position:0%
questions
um

01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
finally new features supports this
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
because children's Behavioral Health
 
01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
isn't a severe crisis right now students
 
01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
across our state are suffering as
 
01:30:17.530 --> 01:30:17.540 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the most recent yrbs data
 
01:30:20.689 --> 01:30:20.699 align:start position:0%
mental health concerns are increasing or
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
at least staying the same anything we
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
can do to help give our students the
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
tools to help reduce those concerns and
 
01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
issues they're facing is a step in the
 
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
right direction and so I ask that you
 
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
vote Senate Bill 151 ought to pass and
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions thank
 
01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
you very much other questions yes
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you and
 
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I like
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
the way that you separated you know what
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
might happen in schools versus actual
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
therapy and and you know in-depth
 
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
treatment and I was wondering if um you
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
see that the school's role is more is
 
01:30:58.370 --> 01:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
teaching Mental Health First Aid
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't catch what the last
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
phrase Mental Health First Aid oh
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think that school should
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely consider teaching that as
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
well and I think it is a program that um
 
01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:13.139 align:start position:0%
it's been shown to work and is really
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the students who have
 
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
taken it
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
um so I'd be more than open to having
 
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
encouraging schools to provide that
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
instruction to their students as well
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
I do have one question
 
01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
um the the uh adding of this into the
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula it says mental health
 
01:31:30.179 --> 01:31:32.030 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula it says mental health
education

01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
and there's rules which develop a
 
01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.050 align:start position:0%
and there's rules which develop a
curriculum

01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
but I also see a timeline in which this
 
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
goes in effect 60 days after signage is
 
01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
that enough time for teachers to be
 
01:31:47.229 --> 01:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
properly prepared
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
and what they should teach where the
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
line is where I'm doing the first aid
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
aspect of this or where I'm getting into
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
the psychologist aspects of it
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
is realistic that we put this in place
 
01:32:01.199 --> 01:32:02.390 align:start position:0%
is realistic that we put this in place
immediately

01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question I'm
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
not an expert on how information is
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
disseminated to teachers in school
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
districts so that may be a better asked
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
by some to someone from the Department
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
of Education or school districts thank
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you further questions just
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for for
 
01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
answering these questions
 
01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.250 align:start position:0%
answering these questions
uh

01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
where's the role of of parents in the
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
middle of teaching and recognizing and
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
bringing in resources
 
01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so much for your
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
question that's a really great Point
 
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
um as we've seen with other initiatives
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
in schools that involve teachers and
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
parents working cohesively outcomes are
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
exponentially better for instance with
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
the mtssb program that program
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
emphasizes uh parents working with the
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
schools in tandem to incorporate
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health supports both in
 
01:32:59.450 --> 01:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
school and at home that program is
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and has been shown to be
 
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
extremely effective in providing better
 
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health outcomes both in
 
01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
schools and at home so we know that that
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
works I think that this bill does not
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
prohibit that by any stretch prohibit
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
parents from being involved and I think
 
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
most schools would actually encourage
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
parents to work with their teacher their
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
students teachers or the school
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
administration to
 
01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
you know learn what their students are
 
01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:28.139 align:start position:0%
learning and also help you know
 
01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
incorporate those coping strategies or
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health supports at the their
 
01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:34.139 align:start position:0%
home as well
 
01:33:34.139 --> 01:33:35.810 align:start position:0%
home as well
yes

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh the multi-tiered system of supports
 
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
for Behavioral Health
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
a tiered structure framework that is
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
implemented in some schools in New
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's again an evidence-based
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
program and it provides some level of
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health supports to all
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
students you know in the anti-bullying
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
campaign or helping to include improved
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
School climate and then for students who
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
need higher levels of support the levels
 
01:34:04.729 --> 01:34:04.739 align:start position:0%
of support goes up and it's fewer
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
students naturally as you go up the
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
chain for what level of support they
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
need but at all levels parents are
 
01:34:13.209 --> 01:34:13.219 align:start position:0%
involved and aware that this is going on
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:34:32.410 --> 01:34:32.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
good morning Melissa white New Hampshire
 
01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
Department of Education division of
 
01:34:38.209 --> 01:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
learner support director and I'm
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions you
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
might have okay I do have one for you
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
then if we're going to be talking doe
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
now great
 
01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
um this is an area we're putting this
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill in wood in 193 E2 which is
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
identifies excuse me the criteria that
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
make up the the learning areas of study
 
01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
but there it's also supposed to be
 
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
replicated again we've seen this
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
disconnect when we saw another bill come
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
in from the Department where it's
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned here but it's not mentioned in
 
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
193 E2
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh or E3 where we have the
 
01:35:19.689 --> 01:35:19.699 align:start position:0%
accountability for the delivery of this
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
and so how would the department uh
 
01:35:26.410 --> 01:35:26.420 align:start position:0%
because all areas of adequacy require
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
accountability and I don't see this
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
referencing that section of law at all
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh how are we going to have an
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
accountability model built in on this
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
component of this that becomes also
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
challenging is that the you know we look
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
further down into 193 E2
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral five the Department of
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
Education and the State Board of
 
01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:52.729 align:start position:0%
Education and the State Board of
Education

01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
Institute the procedures for maintaining
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
updating improving and refining the
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
01:35:57.719 --> 01:35:59.270 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
approval

01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
approval
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
however the curriculum each School
 
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:04.139 align:start position:0%
District shall be responsible for
 
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
maintaining updating improving and
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
refining curriculum
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
so that's the piece where we it becomes
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
a little bit challenging because this
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
state specifically the department shall
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
adopt rules regarding the provision of
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
mental health curriculum so we're
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
running into
 
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
one statute that's saying curriculum
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
lives with the local level
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
but then this is stating it lives with
 
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a piece that we might
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
want to just clarify the Department of
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
Education could
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
um you know do an RFP procure the
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
um the curriculum specified on Mental
 
01:36:43.679 --> 01:36:44.450 align:start position:0%
um the curriculum specified on Mental
Health

01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
and so we could run that we could
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
purchase the curriculum we could make
 
01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:49.820 align:start position:0%
that curriculum available
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
across the state to all of our local
 
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
education agencies agencies schools and
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
all of the chartered Public Schools we
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
can make that available and do that
 
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
portion of it but as far as the
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
accountability piece for ensuring that
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
it has been the curriculum is
 
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
implemented in the school that would not
 
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
fall under the department of education's
 
01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:14.090 align:start position:0%
fall under the department of education's
ability

01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
ability
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
well then I'll follow that up because
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
all areas of adequacy which we have in
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
193 E2 appear also in in the section
 
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
accountability for the opportunity for
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
an adequate education 193 e3b and it
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
lists all those areas now we have a
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
little disconnect because some of them
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
we've changed and hasn't been reflected
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
that was caught by 266 and we're being
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
asked to rewrite that also but it
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
appears to me if we're going to be
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
putting this in underneath adequacy
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
where the criteria is listed and not
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
putting it in the other area we're going
 
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
to get in the same boat we are with 266
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay so that needs to be looked up as
 
01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:01.219 align:start position:0%
well then
 
01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so um I
 
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
just want to you know sort of be clear
 
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
on what uh what you were just um
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
referring to Ms White so looking on line
 
01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:15.229 align:start position:0%
referring to Ms White so looking on line
13

01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
13
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
continuing from line 12. rule making on
 
01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:22.139 align:start position:0%
the provision of mental health
 
01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:24.179 align:start position:0%
curriculum it doesn't say development of
 
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
mental health curriculum so so wouldn't
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that read on provision which
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
would mean for public schools to to
 
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.270 align:start position:0%
would mean for public schools to to
provide

01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
um uh mental health curriculum as
 
01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
identified in paragraph one and uh
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
including all the things that are that
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
are listed below and wouldn't that
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
provision also have accountability uh uh
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.490 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
so I I don't I I don't see this as as
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
requiring the department to develop a
 
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
curriculum certainly not in 60 days
 
01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:06.590 align:start position:0%
curriculum certainly not in 60 days
um

01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
but make sure that that school districts
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
are following rules to provide said
 
01:39:11.699 --> 01:39:12.950 align:start position:0%
are following rules to provide said
curriculum

01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
see what I'm saying so I'm looking at 24
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
and it says the Department of Education
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
shall make available electronically
 
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
model curriculum on mental health
 
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
education so I think that's the piece I
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
was where were you looking line number
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
24 number five where it states the
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education shall make
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
available electronically model
 
01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:35.780 align:start position:0%
curriculum mental health education
 
01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
mind learning all right sir
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
all right let's not be in the amendment
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm sorry section four right
 
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:47.830 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm sorry section four right
right

01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
right and oh I apologize I was looking
 
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
at the introduced I wasn't looking at
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.689 --> 01:39:59.699 align:start position:0%
so school districts shall make
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
curriculum course materials available
 
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that piece of it I thought was about
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
the objectionable
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
material but that's replacing section
 
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
section five I believe is the prime
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
sponsors that is the is the the right of
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
a parent to opt out of curriculum and
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
and basically extends that to to this
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum but uh but I don't see any
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
requirement in here unless you're you're
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
seeing it in any version of this bill
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
that requires the State Board to develop
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
curriculum that you do think that was
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
the previous she'll make available
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
electric electronically model curriculum
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
as the department does in so many areas
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
right now yes and we could make that
 
01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
available we just couldn't require them
 
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
to it right right
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you Mr
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Melissa for being here
 
01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:14.510 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Melissa for being here
um

01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
parts of this on 20 says that the
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
department is going to make available an
 
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
electronic model curriculum
 
01:41:23.689 --> 01:41:23.699 align:start position:0%
so do you ever see that a teacher in a
 
01:41:23.699 --> 01:41:25.729 align:start position:0%
so do you ever see that a teacher in a
classroom

01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
could assign that as a homework so that
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's done at home or and then they can
 
01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
check the box that they've done it or
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
will the department have to hire someone
 
01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:41.219 align:start position:0%
you know go out in the field and figure
 
01:41:42.649 --> 01:41:42.659 align:start position:0%
this out
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how it would like I'm not
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
sure how the local level would implement
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
it and then
 
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
that would be an option based on this do
 
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
you think
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean you don't have to
 
01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
have it's not a right answer I'm looking
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
to see well what you know
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
what can a classroom teacher do
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
if they are now mandated to provide this
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
instruction that would be determined at
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
the local level
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
how it's done well it has to be done
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
according to the RSA yes okay according
 
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
to the I'm sorry the people's
 
01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:18.659 align:start position:0%
legislation yes
 
01:42:21.129 --> 01:42:21.139 align:start position:0%
all right thanks
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
but this does say that Doe make
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
available electronic model curriculum so
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
how much is that going to cost you as a
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
department to make a model for
 
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
curriculum so we would run an RFP to uh
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
accept in those proposals and then of
 
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
course score them based on that when we
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
use the 100 000 estimate that's based on
 
01:42:42.770 --> 01:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
an average across the board that we look
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
at model curriculums if we're purchasing
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
a curriculum for any type of content
 
01:42:49.729 --> 01:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
area so it can range you know from you
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
know ten thousand dollars to the
 
01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
millions and so when we kind of average
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
in uh purchases of curriculum to
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
implement Statewide our average is
 
01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:00.659 align:start position:0%
around somewhere in the middle we got
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
trying to try to choose a hundred
 
01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
thousand it is usually around there um
 
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
for example a
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
um stem Career and Technical education
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
learningblade online platform that we
 
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
implemented that was uh at the cost of a
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
one hundred thousand dollars how much
 
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
was that one hundred thousand dollars so
 
01:43:22.609 --> 01:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
that we kind of looks there's some that
 
01:43:24.169 --> 01:43:24.179 align:start position:0%
we were looking particularly when we
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
were analyzing the dyslexia screening
 
01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
some of those screening on some of those
 
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
curriculums were running you know up to
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
eight hundred thousand dollars so there
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
is you know a variance but we would
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
definitely go through that um
 
01:43:37.729 --> 01:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
procurement process of running that RFP
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
and then taking in those proposals and
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
up scoring and of course being prudent
 
01:43:41.639 --> 01:43:42.590 align:start position:0%
up scoring and of course being prudent
with

01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
and when would you have all this
 
01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:47.149 align:start position:0%
and when would you have all this
completed

01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
completed
 
01:43:47.159 --> 01:43:48.950 align:start position:0%
completed
so

01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
Steve days I don't know if we could have
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
it implemented quite that because we do
 
01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.169 align:start position:0%
it implemented quite that because we do
have

01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:54.179 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
do Hangout to be over ten thousand
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
dollars we would have to go through
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
Governor Council and go through the
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
process so it would be a tight
 
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
turnaround but we we could we could do
 
01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.370 align:start position:0%
turnaround but we we could we could do
that

01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if the schools could
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
implement it in 60 days that's the piece
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
of it that I don't think is possible for
 
01:44:12.169 --> 01:44:12.179 align:start position:0%
example if we look at the changes that
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
we made recently
 
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
um with the uh legislation that
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
implemented the Civics education
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
assessment and having to take the
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
naturalization test and all of the um
 
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
collection of data and all that piece of
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
IT schools were able to implement that
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
it took over a year so they're looking
 
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
at implementing this year but that
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
passed a year ago
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
so that's an example of to implement new
 
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
curriculum usually it takes about
 
01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:43.250 align:start position:0%
curriculum usually it takes about
representative

01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
do you know if there exists now model
 
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that's out there that is
 
01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
free that the doe the curriculum I'm
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
sorry that the doe could just put
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
pointers to to say there's this uh and
 
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
this and this you know if there are
 
01:45:04.729 --> 01:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
multiple things and let the school
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
districts then choose
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
sure I mean we could research all of the
 
01:45:10.609 --> 01:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
free materials that are available out
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
there and then just provide links so
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
that schools are aware of what those
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
could be and they could access them if
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
they needed to we could do that so and
 
01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:21.659 align:start position:0%
that would cut down that hundred
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
thousand correct but if we were yes
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
purchasing a curriculum to implement
 
01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.470 align:start position:0%
purchasing a curriculum to implement
Statewide

01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I think that's the piece of it that
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
we'd have to actually pay for it I think
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
vendors are careful about so much free
 
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
how much of their free material they
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
being here to take these questions
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify a little bit
 
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
of testimony we heard earlier in your
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
opinion on it
 
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
um starting with line 12 under C here
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
um we heard uh some testimony earlier
 
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
that the items listed would be optional
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
for what the department chose to adopt
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that the use of the
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
word shall adopt and in consideration of
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
the following
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that could be
 
01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
reasonably interpreted to mean it needs
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
to include these things would that be a
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
reasonable way that you might interpret
 
01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
including a consideration of the
 
01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
including a consideration of the
following

01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
following
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
do I have the correct language I believe
 
01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
in my opinion including a consideration
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
of the following
 
01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:36.770 align:start position:0%
of the following
seems

01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
seems
 
01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:38.649 align:start position:0%
seems
vague

01:46:38.649 --> 01:46:38.659 align:start position:0%
vague
 
01:46:42.250 --> 01:46:42.260 align:start position:0%
fear it's a consideration of
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
we could look at it and then just not
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
included or take that to mean yes it has
 
01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
to be included so I guess it's
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I was interested in
 
01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you uh for
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
so are we looking at a Statewide
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum that every school should be
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
using and how would we incorporate
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
different grades if it's a curriculum my
 
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
understanding the proposed legislation
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
is looking at adding mental health to
 
01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
the adequate public education components
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
so there's like that that piece of it
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
and then there's another piece of it
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's looking specifically at
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
the making available that electronic
 
01:47:35.689 --> 01:47:35.699 align:start position:0%
making the electronically available
 
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
curriculum to uh
 
01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
there's nothing saying the schools have
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
to use that curriculum it's just saying
 
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
that the department would have to make
 
01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
follow up yes so the schools wouldn't
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
have to okay but schools would have to
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
adopt something
 
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
I would think so yes
 
01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:15.530 align:start position:0%
I would think so yes
adequate

01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
for example I know that with health and
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
wellness currently
 
01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.450 align:start position:0%
wellness currently
um

01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they'll have like a separate
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
at least at the elementary level where
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
my kids are at
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
um they'll have a wellness period so
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
they have their PE class and then
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's also a wellness class that they
 
01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
take once a week and then a lot of the
 
01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.129 align:start position:0%
take once a week and then a lot of the
um

01:48:39.129 --> 01:48:39.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
components or content pieces for that
 
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
Wellness is delivered during that time
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
so they learn about taking care of
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
themselves hygiene that type of thing so
 
01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.930 align:start position:0%
themselves hygiene that type of thing so
I

01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
Health wellness and then mental health
 
01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
kind of into that category so I guess
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
schools could
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
deliver it
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
and deliver that the uh content or the
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
the learning curriculum around the
 
01:49:10.729 --> 01:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
learning components around that
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
particular you know with their own
 
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
chosen curriculum during those blocks
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
but I mean this would be up to the local
 
01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:19.139 align:start position:0%
Education Agency to decide how they want
 
01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
to deliver it how they want to meet the
 
01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:24.350 align:start position:0%
to deliver it how they want to meet the
requirements

01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
so I I have one last question for you
 
01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned about the professional
 
01:49:32.689 --> 01:49:32.699 align:start position:0%
development of ensuring that our
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
teachers are well prepared to venture
 
01:49:38.109 --> 01:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
into this domain
 
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:41.699 align:start position:0%
and if you develop a
 
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
a framework or a guideline through this
 
01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
electronic type version
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it be best as to do what we
 
01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
did with the math learning communities
 
01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
where we worked with the community
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
college system New Hampshire to have
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
summer training for folks from the
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
school districts come down become
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
qualified to teach understand ask the
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
questions and then go back to the
 
01:50:09.649 --> 01:50:09.659 align:start position:0%
classroom and with there's also support
 
01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
coming from the community college to
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that if there's questions while
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
they're in the classroom they have that
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
resource to call I'm I'm real concerned
 
01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:19.139 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have an
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
implementation date here we're going to
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
throw something at and the teacher is
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
going to be said teach this
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
and I as a teacher would be very leery
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
about where that line is and what I can
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
do what I can't do we've had that
 
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
question asked of us in other areas in
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
the classroom just recently our old
 
01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:38.699 align:start position:0%
version of that but we all know where
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
I'm driving home there so I just don't
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
want to create something that's going to
 
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
cause another real significant issue
 
01:50:48.050 --> 01:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
unless we have good strong professional
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
development available for our staff our
 
01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
teachers correct and then would the Lea
 
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
be responsible for paying for that
 
01:50:59.330 --> 01:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
professional development for their
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
teachers or would that be I don't know
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say within the bill here and
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's not yeah and you folks said you
 
01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
couldn't determine other than maybe the
 
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
preparation that developed the
 
01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
electronic version
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
so there's no mention of training at all
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
within this which is a concern to me
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if we implemented a training which
 
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
could be of course done there just would
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
be the cost associated with that and
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's going to be more than the 100 000
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's just an issue to we all have
 
01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
to think about here
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
further yes representative Tanner
 
01:51:32.159 --> 01:51:32.990 align:start position:0%
further yes representative Tanner
yeah

01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
um a couple of I I have a couple of
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
issues uh one is that as a former health
 
01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.109 align:start position:0%
issues uh one is that as a former health
teacher

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
um if I were to get this uh and look at
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
it and say that I had to teach about
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
anxiety depression panic attacks of
 
01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
cells you know etc etc
 
01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:50.510 align:start position:0%
cells you know etc etc
um

01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's not the way
 
01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:56.219 align:start position:0%
uh it's not the way I would do it and it
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
seems it seems
 
01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.689 align:start position:0%
seems it seems
um

01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
almost counterproductive to do that it's
 
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
like an old adage in the first aid and
 
01:52:08.090 --> 01:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
EMT world where they had an ambulance
 
01:52:09.609 --> 01:52:09.619 align:start position:0%
that came to the bottom of a cliff
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
repeatedly to pick up people that had
 
01:52:14.450 --> 01:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
fallen over the cliff and then finally
 
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
somebody decided that maybe somebody
 
01:52:17.930 --> 01:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
should go to the top of the cliff and
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
put a fence so people don't go over the
 
01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:21.609 align:start position:0%
put a fence so people don't go over the
cliff

01:52:21.609 --> 01:52:21.619 align:start position:0%
cliff
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
Stress Management most of these
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
disorders or most of the panic attack
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
that with a child had talked about
 
01:52:28.679 --> 01:52:30.070 align:start position:0%
that with a child had talked about
before

01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
our result of the tremendous stress that
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
kids are under this these days
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me and I think that
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
to try to itemize things like this
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
rather than talk about the actual cause
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
and to talk about
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
presenting skills to students to deal
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
with the stress that they get whether
 
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's anxiety over a test or a panic
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
attack that they you know are are
 
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing because of a relationship
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
um that having those skills are really
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
more important than them knowing what an
 
01:53:09.010 --> 01:53:09.020 align:start position:0%
obsessive compulsive person looks like
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
or what they actually do so
 
01:53:15.649 --> 01:53:15.659 align:start position:0%
and and certainly as I talked about
 
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
before Mental Health First Aid Nami has
 
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
a great program that's available that I
 
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
think every teacher should have to take
 
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm the last person that likes to
 
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
require things like that but I also
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
think that we need to look at that
 
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
section and really look at
 
01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
um like I said Stress Management and how
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
how to give kids the skills to deal with
 
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
the stress that they have so that it
 
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't develop into a lot of these
 
01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
mental health issues already so I I know
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
that's not a question but I would like
 
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
to see the state
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
um you know look at that and and
 
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
certainly I think that's one thing when
 
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
we look at this bill that I will offer
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative luno you had
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
well yeah thank you thank you very much
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so um it sort of it it
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
occurrency as we're sort of having this
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh this hearing and this conversation
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
that that we're looking at the text of
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
the of the bill is amended in the Senate
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
um without the context of the uh the law
 
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
that it seeks to amend so so
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I I guess
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't some of the concerns that that
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
have been expressed by members around
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
the table here with respect to things
 
01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
like professional development and who's
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
creating the curriculum and and all
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
these things potentially be uh be
 
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
covered in the um
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
the paragraph the or the the section of
 
01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:50.219 align:start position:0%
the law that um that
 
01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:53.219 align:start position:0%
Section 3 amends
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
and and what what this what the Bill's
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
doing is is adding to paragraph five
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
apparel a sub paragraph C but there's
 
01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
also a sub paragraph b and a sub
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
paragraph a and five a
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
talks about developing curriculum 5A
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
talks about making sure that that
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
teachers are following following State
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
instructional standards and curriculum
 
01:55:27.649 --> 01:55:27.659 align:start position:0%
standards and are prepared to um to
 
01:55:27.659 --> 01:55:28.609 align:start position:0%
standards and are prepared to um to
provide

01:55:28.609 --> 01:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
um such instruction so that students and
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
it goes on to to talk about that so I
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
guess I'm trying to figure out what am I
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
missing here yes correct so it would
 
01:55:38.930 --> 01:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
state that it does state that each
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
School District shall be responsible for
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
maintaining updating improving and
 
01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
refining curriculum the curriculum shop
 
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
present educational goals broad
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
pedagogical approaches and strategies
 
01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
for assisting students in the
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
development of the skills competencies
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
and knowledge called for by the minimum
 
01:55:59.930 --> 01:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval for
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
each area of Education identified in
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph one it is the responsibility
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
then of local teachers administrators
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
and school boards to identify and
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
Implement approaches best suited for the
 
01:56:13.729 --> 01:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
students in their communities to acquire
 
01:56:16.129 --> 01:56:16.139 align:start position:0%
skills and knowledge in the curriculum
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
to determine the scope organization
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
sequence of offerings and to choose the
 
01:56:22.129 --> 01:56:22.139 align:start position:0%
methods of instruction activities and
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
materials to be used so I my
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
understanding that it would be a
 
01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
the local level to provide that
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
professional development to the teachers
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
great thank you once the minimum
 
01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
standards have been approved by the
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education
 
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.930 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education
correct

01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
and and Mr chair yeah and and as it
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
pertains and you know I don't mean to
 
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
get us off the rails here but the 60
 
01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:51.590 align:start position:0%
get us off the rails here but the 60
days

01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
that applies to the shells that are in
 
01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:56.219 align:start position:0%
here the department shall adopt rules
 
01:57:00.050 --> 01:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
the department shall make available
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
um uh School District's ship required to
 
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy
 
01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.729 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy
um

01:57:07.729 --> 01:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
I mean that's where the Law changes is
 
01:57:13.250 --> 01:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
well that that's that time frame we have
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
for science is just uh in the fact that
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's not going to work uh we when you're
 
01:57:20.689 --> 01:57:20.699 align:start position:0%
talking about having to deal with gel
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
car you're having to develop those rules
 
01:57:25.129 --> 01:57:25.139 align:start position:0%
on on the department and get those
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
things approved by you know is sent from
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
the state board to the gel car
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't say that the rules have
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
to be approved it's just 60 days that
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
that the law comes in I mean yeah I know
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
we're getting it what we would do to an
 
01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
exact session here
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
but but there's a lot to this that you
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
know it's going to take a lot of good
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
discussion here and we could begin all
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the work most definitely within 60
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
days of the passage begin the work yeah
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh anything else
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wonder I haven't
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
heard you mention and so I wonder if
 
01:58:11.159 --> 01:58:12.169 align:start position:0%
heard you mention and so I wonder if
you've

01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:12.179 align:start position:0%
you've
 
01:58:12.179 --> 01:58:15.109 align:start position:0%
you've
experience

01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
excuse me I wonder if you've experienced
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
any of those
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
I'll call them social situations
 
01:58:26.570 --> 01:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
that sometimes evolve around this kind
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
of a subject when it's being explored I
 
01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
speak from some experience unpleasant
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
experiments about this kind of session
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
when you raise the question of human
 
01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.910 align:start position:0%
when you raise the question of human
sexuality

01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
sexuality
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of feedback that you
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
sometimes get the one that comes to mind
 
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
to me was when a young woman approached
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
me and said
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
please make my boyfriend quit beating me
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
and when you start talking about sexual
 
01:58:57.540 --> 01:58:59.870 align:start position:0%
and when you start talking about sexual
relations

01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
relations
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things will start coming
 
01:59:05.450 --> 01:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
up and speaking of Representative caps
 
01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
cadden and the teacher being approached
 
01:59:10.129 --> 01:59:10.139 align:start position:0%
what happens when the little girl comes
 
01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
up and says please make my daddy quit
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
beating my mother
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
how are you taught in student teaching
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
how to answer that question
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
I know when he came to me I was the
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
first lieutenant in it well it's me
 
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I went for help and organized a
 
01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:32.350 align:start position:0%
and I went for help and organized a
completely

01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
invasive approach the person truck you
 
01:59:38.689 --> 01:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
know had him job trained all that kind
 
01:59:40.129 --> 01:59:40.139 align:start position:0%
of stuff
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't enough
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
and those things will arise
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
and they will be stimulated by these
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
kinds of discussions which are part of
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
the subject
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.689 --> 02:00:04.699 align:start position:0%
got a question
 
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
did she uh
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
did she have any experience or any
 
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
occasion to think about those concerns
 
02:00:14.089 --> 02:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
she's coming from the department and
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
giving us technical advice
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh on on the bill and how they would do
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
this yes as a teacher the I mean your
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
required reporter so if anything is
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
revealed to you as a teacher you're
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
required to write well I was
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
sympathizing with representative
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
cascadden and our teacher I'll come to
 
02:00:36.890 --> 02:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
what happens when that teacher how do
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
in my personal experience as a teacher
 
02:00:46.729 --> 02:00:46.739 align:start position:0%
as it also required reporting so when
 
02:00:49.250 --> 02:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
anything you're presented with you
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
report it you get your administrator
 
02:00:53.689 --> 02:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
involved you also employ the experts
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
around you which tend to be the child
 
02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:57.050 align:start position:0%
around you which tend to be the child
psychologists

02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
02:00:59.209 --> 02:00:59.219 align:start position:0%
or the um
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh school counselor to help with next
 
02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
steps in addressing
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
those specific issues but there's one
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
thing I want to I'd like to just make a
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
parallel to if possible
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the
 
02:01:19.609 --> 02:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
um content area
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
mention here is really mirrors a lot of
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
the work that's being done with mtssb
 
02:01:27.890 --> 02:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of requirements in
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
empty in our you know our legislation
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
around mtssb and so a lot of the work
 
02:01:34.609 --> 02:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
being done in our schools with those
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered systems of support for
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
Behavior will look specifically at what
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
is appropriate to do school-wide
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know
 
02:01:46.209 --> 02:01:46.219 align:start position:0%
teaching all students about
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
obsessive-compulsive disorder is not a
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
tier one or an all-school level
 
02:01:53.209 --> 02:01:53.219 align:start position:0%
um specific area to look at but maybe
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's something more tier two the
 
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
education around so there's there's
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
different pieces that I think are
 
02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
there's some overlap here with work that
 
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
we're already doing
 
02:02:07.149 --> 02:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
um through mtssb and a lot of the other
 
02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
initiatives and our wellness program
 
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
and through the work that we coordinate
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
with Department of Health and Human
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
Services so there is a lot of overlap
 
02:02:19.609 --> 02:02:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.250 --> 02:02:21.260 align:start position:0%
further questions of the department
 
02:02:26.089 --> 02:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
we have no further pink cards on this so
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close this hearing for
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 151 thank you for the
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%

here and we're planning on having a
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
caucus in between doing our exact
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
sessions which will follow here so what
 
03:53:08.769 --> 03:53:08.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:12.110 --> 03:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
foreign okay I think we're ready to go

ahead here for our exact sessions we're
 
03:53:16.370 --> 03:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
just going to go through it by the
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
numbers so we'll start with 24 and work
 
03:53:27.889 --> 03:53:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh we have in front of us SB 24

03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
03:53:43.370 --> 03:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh hold off on that we want to have
 
03:53:45.650 --> 03:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
further information provided to us by
 
03:53:50.769 --> 03:53:50.779 align:start position:0%

and namely that's involves like Jim Dean
 
03:53:58.729 --> 03:53:58.739 align:start position:0%

information is needed
so

03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
so we're going to jump over that bill
 
03:54:17.630 --> 03:54:17.640 align:start position:0%

a motion made by representative
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
03:54:41.330 --> 03:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
um we had already passed uh House Bill
 
03:54:45.050 --> 03:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
71 which is the same bill that is in the
 
03:54:45.060 --> 03:54:46.250 align:start position:0%
71 which is the same bill that is in the
Senate

03:54:46.250 --> 03:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
um the senate committee was uh favorable
 
03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
to that I think it was a five-nothing
 
03:54:54.050 --> 03:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
vote the full Senate hasn't
 
03:54:57.290 --> 03:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
um hasn't voted on that yet so my
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
thought is that we should retain this in
 
03:55:03.769 --> 03:55:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.710 --> 03:55:08.720 align:start position:0%

03:56:58.250 --> 03:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thank you very much
 
03:57:02.210 --> 03:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so um so I'm you know I think
 
03:57:04.849 --> 03:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
prepared to support the um the ought to
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
pass but I think um there has been some
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
some uh discussion that that this could
 
03:57:16.130 --> 03:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
cause some confusion or problems with
 
03:57:18.889 --> 03:57:18.899 align:start position:0%
with some school districts and I was
 
03:57:22.849 --> 03:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
wondering if if um if the if Ms Wilson
 
03:57:24.769 --> 03:57:24.779 align:start position:0%
might might be able to
 
03:57:24.779 --> 03:57:26.210 align:start position:0%
might might be able to
um

03:57:26.210 --> 03:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:26.220 --> 03:57:27.349 align:start position:0%
um
um

03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.729 --> 03:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
she's hiding behind that little box in
 
03:57:37.250 --> 03:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
front of me this is on um on House Bill
 
03:57:39.769 --> 03:57:39.779 align:start position:0%

03:57:52.370 --> 03:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record Becky Wilson uh
 
03:57:57.650 --> 03:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
03:58:00.250 --> 03:58:00.260 align:start position:0%
how can I help answer the questions
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if there's if um if
 
03:58:06.889 --> 03:58:06.899 align:start position:0%
there are concerns out there that there
 
03:58:08.570 --> 03:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
could be some consequences that come out
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
of this bill that may create some maybe
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
problematic for some districts
 
03:58:15.769 --> 03:58:15.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question or the
 
03:58:18.830 --> 03:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
clarification I I will say I think that
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
um you know some of these questions are
 
03:58:22.490 --> 03:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
probably best directed to the department
 
03:58:24.170 --> 03:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
in terms of how what the current
 
03:58:27.290 --> 03:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
practices are however the transportation
 
03:58:29.210 --> 03:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
monitors as representative penernal
 
03:58:31.969 --> 03:58:31.979 align:start position:0%
mentioned are typically on
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
transportation for some students in in
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
particular as an IEP service that's part
 
03:58:39.229 --> 03:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
of a child's IEP Transportation
 
03:58:42.050 --> 03:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
monitoring to ensure safety of students
 
03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have some students who are non-verbal
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
for example or students who just need
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
additional oversight during a longer
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
trip it's not uncommon for
 
03:58:54.769 --> 03:58:54.779 align:start position:0%
transportation monitors to be on Regular
 
03:58:57.170 --> 03:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
Ad buses but also on special education
 
03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation so the the challenges I
 
03:59:03.610 --> 03:59:03.620 align:start position:0%
think with this is that a lot of
 
03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
Transportation that's going to an out of
 
03:59:08.210 --> 03:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
District placement for example they may
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
pick up students from multiple districts
 
03:59:13.969 --> 03:59:13.979 align:start position:0%
to go to the same placement
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
um it's not if it's a transportation
 
03:59:18.349 --> 03:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
monitor who is employed by the school
 
03:59:20.210 --> 03:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
district and monitoring a School
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
District school-owned transportation
 
03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
going to and from a local public school
 
03:59:27.889 --> 03:59:27.899 align:start position:0%
for example that that is fairly easy to
 
03:59:29.570 --> 03:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
figure out who's doing the background
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
check is the SAU or the superintendent
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
um for the background checks for
 
03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
transportation monitors who might be
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
employed by a contracted service
 
03:59:38.399 --> 03:59:40.370 align:start position:0%
employed by a contracted service
provider

03:59:40.370 --> 03:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:59:42.769 --> 03:59:42.779 align:start position:0%
um that how those background checks are
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
done is something that's negotiated
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
between the SAU and the contracted
 
03:59:51.050 --> 03:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
provider so you all the contractor
 
03:59:52.849 --> 03:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
providers to my knowledge and again I'm
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
not a contracted service provider but do
 
03:59:57.050 --> 03:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
their own background checks on the
 
03:59:59.630 --> 03:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
transportation monitor some school
 
04:00:02.030 --> 04:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
districts have in their contract with
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
that company that they are also going to
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
do their own background check
 
04:00:10.250 --> 04:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
some do not necessarily do it back a
 
04:00:12.410 --> 04:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
second background check they are relying
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
on the transportation provider to do
 
04:00:15.359 --> 04:00:16.670 align:start position:0%
on the transportation provider to do
that

04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:16.680 --> 04:00:17.870 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's some you know liability I think
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
no matter which way you go with that but
 
04:00:24.349 --> 04:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
if you have multiple students from
 
04:00:26.269 --> 04:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
different districts riding on One
 
04:00:29.809 --> 04:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
Transportation with one monitor there's
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
a potential that if you had four or five
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
six kids from different districts on one
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
bus that is a contracted provider that
 
04:00:38.570 --> 04:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
that monitor is going to be background
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
checked six or seven times
 
04:00:43.070 --> 04:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:00:45.769 --> 04:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
how you resolve if one District says we
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
are okay with what's on the background
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
check you know obviously there's some
 
04:00:50.990 --> 04:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
things that you can't ignore the section
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
5 violations for example are not
 
04:00:55.490 --> 04:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
negotiable but as is often said in this
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
commit committee employment decisions
 
04:00:59.809 --> 04:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
based on the background check are at the
 
04:01:01.729 --> 04:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
level of the district so if you have
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
multiple districts with students on that
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
bus and multiple districts are doing
 
04:01:07.849 --> 04:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
background checks for the same person
 
04:01:09.290 --> 04:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
I just
 
04:01:11.570 --> 04:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
at what you know I don't know at what
 
04:01:11.580 --> 04:01:12.889 align:start position:0%
at what you know I don't know at what
point

04:01:12.889 --> 04:01:12.899 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:01:16.849 --> 04:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
that causes a potential challenge
 
04:01:16.859 --> 04:01:17.630 align:start position:0%
that causes a potential challenge
um

04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:19.849 --> 04:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
I think there's it's just not consistent
 
04:01:21.950 --> 04:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily who is doing the background
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
check for contracted providers or
 
04:01:26.570 --> 04:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
whether you want that somehow in a
 
04:01:28.130 --> 04:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
contract if you are a district that's
 
04:01:30.410 --> 04:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
Contracting with multiple
 
04:01:33.889 --> 04:01:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
so just a quick follow-up so so if um if
 
04:01:39.710 --> 04:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
one of the school districts let's say
 
04:01:41.450 --> 04:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
with multiple school districts one of
 
04:01:43.250 --> 04:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
the school districts conducted the the
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
background check and then the
 
04:01:46.969 --> 04:01:46.979 align:start position:0%
superintendents talked and said Yep this
 
04:01:49.490 --> 04:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
this person's clear they could all agree
 
04:01:52.010 --> 04:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
that or if they wanted to they could
 
04:01:55.729 --> 04:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
agree or could they agree to to go with
 
04:01:58.250 --> 04:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
that one background check or if they all
 
04:01:59.929 --> 04:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
wanted to do independent background
 
04:02:01.969 --> 04:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
checks could they go ahead and do that
 
04:02:03.650 --> 04:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
as well well thank you for the question
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
I think the challenge would come from
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
the statutes you already have about
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
background checks that only the
 
04:02:10.429 --> 04:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent and their designee are
 
04:02:11.630 --> 04:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:02:14.210 --> 04:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
view the background check and then
 
04:02:16.969 --> 04:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
communicate with others so six six
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
superintendents couldn't look at the
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
same background check they would have to
 
04:02:20.929 --> 04:02:20.939 align:start position:0%
do their own individual background
 
04:02:29.170 --> 04:02:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair I don't know if
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
this is for Miss Wilson or president of
 
04:02:40.010 --> 04:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
pertinel I don't know which one but my
 
04:02:43.490 --> 04:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
question is is the Transportation uh
 
04:02:46.429 --> 04:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
monitor background check that's done by
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
the bus company
 
04:02:50.929 --> 04:02:50.939 align:start position:0%
uh similar in quality to the
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
transportation check done by the school
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't know
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
that I can answer that I'm not
 
04:03:00.889 --> 04:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
I think it I don't know what the
 
04:03:02.889 --> 04:03:02.899 align:start position:0%
transportation companies
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
requirements are I I believe and I'm
 
04:03:07.490 --> 04:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
speaking a bit out of turn because I'm
 
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
not the one that's signing any of these
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
contracts but my belief would be that if
 
04:03:13.250 --> 04:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
you have a district as part of their
 
04:03:15.650 --> 04:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
contract with these outside companies is
 
04:03:18.769 --> 04:03:18.779 align:start position:0%
accepting that background check that
 
04:03:20.750 --> 04:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
there it must meet a certain criteria
 
04:03:23.150 --> 04:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
for the person to be able to be to sign
 
04:03:25.849 --> 04:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
that contract but I don't know offhand
 
04:03:29.210 --> 04:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
what I would imagine so
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I think the original intention of
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
this bill was just to get it out of the
 
04:03:34.250 --> 04:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and put it back to
 
04:03:35.809 --> 04:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
the district which I think I understand
 
04:03:38.450 --> 04:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
the Catalyst for that
 
04:03:40.370 --> 04:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I I just think it wouldn't we
 
04:03:41.929 --> 04:03:41.939 align:start position:0%
districts would like it to be clear
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
about what it is that they're supposed
 
04:03:45.469 --> 04:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
to do in these situations where they're
 
04:03:48.650 --> 04:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
using a contracted provider
 
04:03:51.530 --> 04:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
sure just a comment to the chair of
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
Primrose I um and I wasn't here for I
 
04:03:55.490 --> 04:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
saw someone on screen on the you know
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
the home but my concern is that the the
 
04:04:00.950 --> 04:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
last year we had uh the last two
 
04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
sessions Rick we had questions about uh
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
private private coach Vehicles those bus
 
04:04:09.290 --> 04:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
drivers in and I understand why that
 
04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
passed uh in the background check stuff
 
04:04:13.370 --> 04:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
but this concerns me that we're going
 
04:04:17.210 --> 04:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
once again moving into a uh process of
 
04:04:20.570 --> 04:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
less evaluation versus equal to one more
 
04:04:25.790 --> 04:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
so everybody confused I know I'm so
 
04:04:32.269 --> 04:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
sorry I apologize for confusing everyone
 
04:04:32.279 --> 04:04:35.290 align:start position:0%
sorry I apologize for confusing everyone
foreign

04:04:35.290 --> 04:04:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.090 --> 04:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
it is a bit different than bus drivers
 
04:04:38.100 --> 04:04:39.290 align:start position:0%
it is a bit different than bus drivers
yeah

04:04:39.290 --> 04:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:04:41.809 --> 04:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
um because the drivers obviously are
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
falling under the department of Ed which
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
I think everyone to my knowledge is
 
04:04:46.729 --> 04:04:46.739 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that because those are
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat portable
 
04:04:50.030 --> 04:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the transportation monitors are
 
04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
typically I don't want to say specific
 
04:04:54.170 --> 04:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
to an individual student but to some
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
extent specific to certain
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
employment issue to the district it's an
 
04:04:59.399 --> 04:05:00.429 align:start position:0%
employment issue to the district it's an
employment

04:05:00.429 --> 04:05:00.439 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:05:02.689 --> 04:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
consideration I guess for lack of a
 
04:05:05.450 --> 04:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
better term yes yeah I think uh I think
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh attorney Fenton did indicate that
 
04:05:11.450 --> 04:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
there could be an mou that could be
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
developed between school districts
 
04:05:16.370 --> 04:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with respective monitors that
 
04:05:18.290 --> 04:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
may be dealing with kids in multiple
 
04:05:19.969 --> 04:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
school districts multiple School
 
04:05:19.979 --> 04:05:23.150 align:start position:0%
school districts multiple School
situations

04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:28.250 --> 04:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:28.260 --> 04:05:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.050 --> 04:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
does anybody more time on this bill
 
04:05:38.210 --> 04:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
or are you
 
04:05:41.290 --> 04:05:41.300 align:start position:0%
ready to go ahead with it so yeah just a
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
clarifying uh question but so
 
04:05:46.250 --> 04:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Miler
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
um uh recalls that um that the attorney
 
04:05:51.290 --> 04:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
from the Department said that that
 
04:05:53.570 --> 04:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
multiple districts may be able to end
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
enter into a memorandum of understanding
 
04:05:59.570 --> 04:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to um uh Transportation
 
04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
monitor maybe saying that district one
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
takes care of doing the hiring and
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
background check and if if that um
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
all works out then the the other
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
districts will defer to that as opposed
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
to sharing background check information
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
which they they cannot do under under
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
current law
 
04:06:23.570 --> 04:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and and that in the worst case it
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like the employee the prospective
 
04:06:29.210 --> 04:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
employee would be background checked if
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
it was if it was four districts possibly
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
four times which cumbersome
 
04:06:37.729 --> 04:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
um doesn't
 
04:06:37.739 --> 04:06:38.630 align:start position:0%
um doesn't
um

04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't break the system it doesn't
 
04:06:44.450 --> 04:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
mean that now children are students are
 
04:06:46.610 --> 04:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
going to be transported uh in a
 
04:06:48.170 --> 04:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
situation where where a transportation
 
04:06:51.050 --> 04:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
monitor is necessary that where they
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
can't hire a I mean it doesn't prevent a
 
04:06:56.750 --> 04:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
monitor from being hired
 
04:06:58.849 --> 04:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question I think I I
 
04:07:01.010 --> 04:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
think I would defer any legal background
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
check questions to the department and I
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
would ask I guess that those questions
 
04:07:07.490 --> 04:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
go to attorney Fenton she really is the
 
04:07:09.290 --> 04:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
criminal background check person in
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the interplay of all of that
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
and how an mou would work
 
04:07:14.750 --> 04:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and what happens if districts don't
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
agree on the monitor or which whatever
 
04:07:19.610 --> 04:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
however that would play out okay thanks
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
Becky you're welcome
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
as represent Cornell is this going to
 
04:07:26.030 --> 04:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
finance after us
 
04:07:29.570 --> 04:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
no no no this is a bill we don't have to
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily act on today either
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
um we've we've written mous in the
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
various forms of legislation in the past
 
04:07:40.010 --> 04:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
I remember we wrote an mou between
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College and the Hanover Police
 
04:07:41.819 --> 04:07:42.889 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College and the Hanover Police
Department

04:07:42.889 --> 04:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh rape on campus
 
04:07:49.070 --> 04:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
that was years ago so we we've been in
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
the business of adding mou language into
 
04:07:53.150 --> 04:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
bills if that's something which might
 
04:07:55.370 --> 04:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
help clarify here
 
04:07:55.380 --> 04:07:56.389 align:start position:0%
help clarify here
um

04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.510 --> 04:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
but there's no necessary urgency to be
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
doing something today
 
04:08:05.650 --> 04:08:05.660 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
well then if there's really a feeling if
 
04:08:11.929 --> 04:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
there's no sense not doing anything if
 
04:08:13.309 --> 04:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do anything on the
 
04:08:15.170 --> 04:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
side otherwise we'll just go ahead but
 
04:08:16.729 --> 04:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
if we're going to look for something to
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
try and
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
clear up some of the ambiguity maybe
 
04:08:23.929 --> 04:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
it's wise doing that
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
if it's going to help a school district
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
i i as a monitor I wouldn't want to have
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
to go get four or five different checks
 
04:08:32.330 --> 04:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's that's craziness if an mou could
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
be written where you know I do it with
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
your district and then the other four
 
04:08:38.150 --> 04:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
districts over there are accepting it
 
04:08:41.210 --> 04:08:41.220 align:start position:0%
why isn't that good yeah right but saves
 
04:08:49.990 --> 04:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.929 --> 04:08:53.939 align:start position:0%
I I I agree with you I don't think that
 
04:08:55.490 --> 04:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily we have to put it into the
 
04:08:57.110 --> 04:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
statute that there's going to be an mou
 
04:09:02.809 --> 04:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
then why do we need to build
 
04:09:08.530 --> 04:09:08.540 align:start position:0%
move it to move the background check out
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
take a vote how about just a show of
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
hands how many people would like to just
 
04:09:22.849 --> 04:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
take a vote and get this thing done
 
04:09:25.130 --> 04:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
today or how many people
 
04:09:28.610 --> 04:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we're all there
 
04:09:31.849 --> 04:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
okay so let's move on with it then
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
so is there any further discussion on on
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
the bill right now we're on SB 39 the
 
04:09:39.410 --> 04:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
motion on the table is ought to pass any
 
04:09:42.050 --> 04:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
further discussion on that motion

04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
changes in school placement for students
 
04:10:50.809 --> 04:10:50.819 align:start position:0%

have a motion on the table ought to pass
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
on SB 77 made by representative cordelli
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
and second by representative leckis
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli do you have any
 
04:11:12.840 --> 04:11:14.030 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli do you have any
discussion

04:11:14.030 --> 04:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:11:16.070 --> 04:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
um I believe that in our statute for
 
04:11:21.769 --> 04:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
best interest in manifest education
 
04:11:21.779 --> 04:11:23.469 align:start position:0%
best interest in manifest education
hardship

04:11:23.469 --> 04:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
04:11:28.490 --> 04:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
throughout this uh section of law it
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
refers to an approved private schools or
 
04:11:34.689 --> 04:11:34.699 align:start position:0%
public schools or public academies
 
04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
I think that all our options defined in
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
law already so I think that in this
 
04:11:44.279 --> 04:11:45.849 align:start position:0%
law already so I think that in this
section

04:11:45.849 --> 04:11:45.859 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:11:51.410 --> 04:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
3A that it should be reflective of the
 
04:11:52.990 --> 04:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
rest of the statute
 
04:11:58.250 --> 04:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's a policy in
 
04:12:01.269 --> 04:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
this section of the statute
 
04:12:04.010 --> 04:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
I think it has to be consistent with the
 
04:12:07.610 --> 04:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
rest of uh the chapter
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the second
 
04:12:10.680 --> 04:12:12.830 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the second
no

04:12:12.830 --> 04:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:12:15.969 --> 04:12:15.979 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm confused about an approved private
 
04:12:25.849 --> 04:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
school is it
 
04:12:27.889 --> 04:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
what's it approved for is it approved
 
04:12:29.929 --> 04:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
for uh providing an adequate education
 
04:12:32.330 --> 04:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
is it approved for
 
04:12:35.450 --> 04:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
um compulsory education
 
04:12:38.809 --> 04:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
I have yet to find out
 
04:12:41.689 --> 04:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
but it's approved for I mean I I know
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
the school board has to approve it but
 
04:12:45.290 --> 04:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
what are they what's what are they
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
approving it for what's the approval
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I I can tell you that
 
04:13:04.969 --> 04:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
I recall when we gave approval to
 
04:13:08.210 --> 04:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
Freiburg Academy and the St Johnsbury
 
04:13:08.220 --> 04:13:09.590 align:start position:0%
Freiburg Academy and the St Johnsbury
Academy

04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
04:13:09.600 --> 04:13:11.269 align:start position:0%
Academy
that

04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:14.330 --> 04:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
and that came about as results that we
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
were tuitioning students from this state
 
04:13:19.130 --> 04:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
to those academies and uh there was a
 
04:13:20.570 --> 04:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion back then in those
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
days whether we should be doing that at
 
04:13:24.830 --> 04:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
all and Saint Jay called up and said hey
 
04:13:27.410 --> 04:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
we we receive in revenue on tuition each
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
year from you in New Hampshire 1.5
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:13:36.050 --> 04:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
and so I found a place in statute and I
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately all my stickies are in
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
the old book not in the and maybe old
 
04:13:45.290 --> 04:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
old book and and uh I had one there
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
where the commissioner of Education in
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
this state has given that the authority
 
04:13:55.370 --> 04:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
to approve these schools based on the
 
04:13:58.250 --> 04:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
fact that they are part of a state which
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
has the interstate government agreement
 
04:14:03.469 --> 04:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
with us Vermont and Maine both do
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
and so that means if they're an approved
 
04:14:07.550 --> 04:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
school by the department over there
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
either in Montpelier or in Augusta they
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
are approved here you know so at that
 
04:14:16.729 --> 04:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
time Ginny Berry commissioner Barry
 
04:14:19.250 --> 04:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
wrote a letter the next day saying those
 
04:14:20.990 --> 04:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
were approved schools
 
04:14:23.090 --> 04:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
now I'd have to find that area statute
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
which allows the commissioner to do that
 
04:14:28.849 --> 04:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
so is it follow-up so we're talking
 
04:14:31.729 --> 04:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
about approved by the commissioner or
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
approved by this local school board
 
04:14:38.689 --> 04:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
um and uh does anybody know what the
 
04:14:41.150 --> 04:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
process of that is I mean
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
how they go about approve I mean I can
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
see St John's you know a school approved
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
in Vermont by meeting the adequate
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
education policies there and also if
 
04:14:55.550 --> 04:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
they meet the adequate education
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
policies in Maine find you know
 
04:15:00.769 --> 04:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
reciprocal but I'm not sure how we go
 
04:15:03.410 --> 04:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
about looking at every private school in
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
whether they're approved or not or who
 
04:15:09.050 --> 04:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
approves them whether there's a list or
 
04:15:11.929 --> 04:15:11.939 align:start position:0%
do you know there isn't a list on the
 
04:15:13.490 --> 04:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Education website there's
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
a list of approved private schools I've
 
04:15:17.809 --> 04:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
approved and they've been approved by
 
04:15:20.150 --> 04:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
the commissioner by the department yeah
 
04:15:22.010 --> 04:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
yeah the commissioner is ultimately
 
04:15:24.490 --> 04:15:24.500 align:start position:0%
responsible and we don't know what it's
 
04:15:27.110 --> 04:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh by that kind of because the school
 
04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
board has a responsibility to make sure
 
04:15:32.450 --> 04:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
that the students that they support get
 
04:15:35.150 --> 04:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
an adequate education that's in statute
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
that they have to get the opportunity
 
04:15:39.530 --> 04:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education so I'm
 
04:15:41.929 --> 04:15:41.939 align:start position:0%
assuming that if a school board approves
 
04:15:43.809 --> 04:15:43.819 align:start position:0%
a private school
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
they've checked to make sure that that
 
04:15:50.050 --> 04:15:50.060 align:start position:0%
school meets the standards of
 
04:15:53.210 --> 04:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
adequate education here's the section
 
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm talking to making references 194
 
04:15:57.769 --> 04:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
colon 23
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
Dash B small B and it's Roman number two
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
and it reads the commissioner of the
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education made through an
 
04:16:07.370 --> 04:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
agreement with another state when such
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
State and New Hampshire are parties to
 
04:16:11.330 --> 04:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
an interstate agreement allow New
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pupils to attend schools that
 
04:16:15.530 --> 04:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
meet the standards established by one of
 
04:16:17.150 --> 04:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
the two states
 
04:16:19.610 --> 04:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
so it's basically what I just I said
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
that if it's approved by Augusta it's
 
04:16:24.110 --> 04:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
good and I get that
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's on page 586. yep
 
04:16:33.590 --> 04:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
I I would um looking at the chapter that
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
we're in the section of law
 
04:16:38.929 --> 04:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
if in relation to the best interest of
 
04:16:41.150 --> 04:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
the child if the superintendent agrees
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
that it's in the best interests of the
 
04:16:43.199 --> 04:16:45.349 align:start position:0%
that it's in the best interests of the
child

04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:16:45.359 --> 04:16:46.189 align:start position:0%
child
um

04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
the superintendent shall initiate a
 
04:16:53.570 --> 04:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
change of assignment uh to within this
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
current assigned School District
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
to another public school or public
 
04:17:02.809 --> 04:17:02.819 align:start position:0%
Academy within the district or to a
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
Public School
 
04:17:06.590 --> 04:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
public Academy or approved private
 
04:17:09.050 --> 04:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
school in another District
 
04:17:12.290 --> 04:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
right and that that's that turn my
 
04:17:15.170 --> 04:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
problem is the term approved
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
um but this isn't in the best
 
04:17:18.889 --> 04:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
intersection it's not the Manifest
 
04:17:22.370 --> 04:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.380 --> 04:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
well I I think they're all part of the
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
same in that if this parent the family
 
04:17:34.729 --> 04:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
does not
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
um uh get agreement with the
 
04:17:40.729 --> 04:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
superintendent they can appeal to the
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
school board which is the Manifest
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
education hardship provisions yeah
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
and ultimately then to the state board
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
right but I think but financial
 
04:17:52.370 --> 04:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I think are different
 
04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
in the best interest compared to the
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
Manifest educational hardship
 
04:17:59.689 --> 04:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
section and
 
04:17:59.699 --> 04:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
section and
and

04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:04.150 --> 04:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
anyway I think this um
 
04:18:06.830 --> 04:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
what what what's being what's being
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
modified here
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
um is um is is not what
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
I mean on page 507 in the right hand
 
04:18:21.469 --> 04:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
column part uh paragraph d a parent or
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
Guardian can make a specific request to
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
a public school public Academy or
 
04:18:29.330 --> 04:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
approved private school within the
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
district or outside of the district and
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
and then that language is repeated
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
um in paragraph F if the school board
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
finds that the student has a manifest
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
education hardship and it uses all that
 
04:18:46.010 --> 04:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
language but in
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
but with Senate Bill 77 is doing is
 
04:18:53.150 --> 04:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
modifying on the left hand column of 508
 
04:18:54.889 --> 04:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
page 508
 
04:18:58.010 --> 04:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
paragraph e where each School Board
 
04:19:00.889 --> 04:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
shall establish a policy
 
04:19:00.899 --> 04:19:01.929 align:start position:0%
shall establish a policy
um

04:19:01.929 --> 04:19:01.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
which allow the school board with the
 
04:19:06.889 --> 04:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
recognition to the of the superintendent
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
to take appropriate action including
 
04:19:12.170 --> 04:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
assignment to another public school or
 
04:19:15.769 --> 04:19:15.779 align:start position:0%
public Academy within the district or or
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
public Academy Public School outside of
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
the district this is adding approved
 
04:19:25.849 --> 04:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
private school to both of those and it
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
it it really it changes the um
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
no it it yeah it changes the obligation
 
04:19:38.210 --> 04:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
at the very top of the left hand column
 
04:19:42.530 --> 04:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
of 508 it begins with the bottom of the
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
writing column of 507 where it talks
 
04:19:46.849 --> 04:19:46.859 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:19:46.859 --> 04:19:47.650 align:start position:0%
about the
the

04:19:47.650 --> 04:19:47.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
tuition shall be computed according to
 
04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
the school board of the district in
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
which the student resides shall approve
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
the tuition payment
 
04:20:00.530 --> 04:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a it's a different
 
04:20:00.540 --> 04:20:01.990 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a it's a different
um

04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I but the school if you
 
04:20:08.929 --> 04:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
look the school board shall establish a
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
policy that is consistent consistent
 
04:20:16.010 --> 04:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
so they can't go off and say we're just
 
04:20:20.929 --> 04:20:20.939 align:start position:0%
you know establishing no no I yeah
 
04:20:23.929 --> 04:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
policy that says we're going to let the
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
kid go to the school district to the
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
north of us
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
right right but it's but it's it's
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
basically requiring every school board
 
04:20:35.689 --> 04:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
to to have in place tuition agreements
 
04:20:38.450 --> 04:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
with non-public schools
 
04:20:38.460 --> 04:20:39.229 align:start position:0%
with non-public schools
um

04:20:39.229 --> 04:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:41.689 --> 04:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
and um and school boards don't have to
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
do that right now they can certainly
 
04:20:46.969 --> 04:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
have have specific contracts with
 
04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
non-public schools consistent with State
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
policy but they don't actually have to
 
04:20:53.090 --> 04:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
have a school board policy to have
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
contracts with non-public schools and
 
04:20:59.450 --> 04:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
and that's what the modification in in E
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
is um is doing is is was there a
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.929 --> 04:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
my recollection is the testimony that um
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh was that this was to make this
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with the rest of the section
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and I do believe that that was the
 
04:21:22.080 --> 04:21:23.210 align:start position:0%
um and I do believe that that was the
same

04:21:23.210 --> 04:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
um uh rationale that was used in the
 
04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
Senate when they passed this right so so
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
the rationale was essentially
 
04:21:31.070 --> 04:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
housekeeping but this isn't a
 
04:21:34.030 --> 04:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
housekeeping section that's that's
 
04:21:37.130 --> 04:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
the you know just because certain
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
languages used in other paragraphs
 
04:21:41.150 --> 04:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that this language
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
that that language where a parent May
 
04:21:47.450 --> 04:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
request or a school board May approve
 
04:21:50.210 --> 04:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
um that that language should also exist
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the paragraph that says the
 
04:21:56.929 --> 04:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
school board shall establish policy
 
04:21:58.849 --> 04:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to establish
 
04:22:01.630 --> 04:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
policy on this they don't have to
 
04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
establish tuition agreements with with
 
04:22:08.450 --> 04:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:10.849 --> 04:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
parents can certainly request school
 
04:22:13.309 --> 04:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
boards can certainly approve on a
 
04:22:19.210 --> 04:22:19.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:23.570 --> 04:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
it does mention on page 509
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
Romans 7
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
and this section approved as school
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
tuition program means the school that
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
has been approved and contracted by the
 
04:22:33.650 --> 04:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
school board to provide students with
 
04:22:35.150 --> 04:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to acquire an adequate
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.010 --> 04:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
right I'm not I'm not suggesting that
 
04:22:45.410 --> 04:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
the that the non-public schools are in
 
04:22:47.570 --> 04:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
any way less than adequate
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm just saying that that school
 
04:22:52.490 --> 04:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
board doesn't have to establish a list
 
04:22:54.170 --> 04:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
of non-public schools where they have
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
tuition uh programs too which is what he
 
04:23:00.729 --> 04:23:00.739 align:start position:0%
is asking them to do as opposed to
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
Public Schools where where they have um
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know superintendent to
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent agreed on a manifest
 
04:23:09.600 --> 04:23:18.349 align:start position:0%
superintendent agreed on a manifest
hardship

04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.359 --> 04:23:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative leckers
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
I don't get your argument at all about
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
lists and all that kind of stuff it just
 
04:23:30.410 --> 04:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
said it should establish a policy
 
04:23:33.410 --> 04:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
consistent with State board's rules
 
04:23:36.530 --> 04:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
which allow the school board with the
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the superintendent to
 
04:23:41.150 --> 04:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
take appropriate action including
 
04:23:43.969 --> 04:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
assignment two and then it lists those
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
three which are under those three are
 
04:23:50.150 --> 04:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
under 193.3
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
um e no F3
 
04:23:57.290 --> 04:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
is one of the options and so it makes
 
04:23:59.090 --> 04:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
sense that if that's one of the options
 
04:24:01.550 --> 04:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
that a school board should come up with
 
04:24:03.110 --> 04:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
a policy of how they're going to deal
 
04:24:04.849 --> 04:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
with those options because the options
 
04:24:07.490 --> 04:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
are in the law right now and that's just
 
04:24:09.290 --> 04:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
say all this says is you got to come up
 
04:24:11.210 --> 04:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
with a policy for how you're going to
 
04:24:13.729 --> 04:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
handle those options and they may decide
 
04:24:16.330 --> 04:24:16.340 align:start position:0%
that their policy is never to send a kid
 
04:24:20.570 --> 04:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
to a um approved private school that may
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
be their policy but they have to come up
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
with a policy because these three
 
04:24:28.910 --> 04:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
options are what's in law right now in
 
04:24:28.920 --> 04:24:30.769 align:start position:0%
options are what's in law right now in
1933

we're up to 152 right now this is
 
04:30:56.570 --> 04:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
relative to New Hampshire Workforce
 
04:30:58.729 --> 04:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
training programs I'd like to have a
 
04:31:00.290 --> 04:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
little discussion if we could please on
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
that before we take a motion on the
 
04:31:01.800 --> 04:31:03.530 align:start position:0%
that before we take a motion on the
table

04:31:03.530 --> 04:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
table
 
04:31:03.540 --> 04:31:08.450 align:start position:0%
table
um

04:31:08.450 --> 04:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh represent Cornell was there any
 
04:31:13.809 --> 04:31:13.819 align:start position:0%
discussion of this bill yesterday at the
 
04:31:17.450 --> 04:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
pte meeting you attended yes there was
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
and they were very excited that we
 
04:31:21.950 --> 04:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
possibly would be passing this because
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
it could combine welding with scuba
 
04:31:24.960 --> 04:31:26.510 align:start position:0%
it could combine welding with scuba
diving

04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
diving
 
04:31:29.710 --> 04:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
um make a
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
certificate to enable a growing
 
04:31:33.720 --> 04:31:35.149 align:start position:0%
certificate to enable a growing
Workforce

04:31:35.149 --> 04:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
um they were thinking they would be
 
04:31:41.689 --> 04:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
started in one CTA te location
 
04:31:44.210 --> 04:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
um possibly I think they were thinking
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth because the pool is walkable
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
distance from the CTE Center and so they
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
could just combine the two programs
 
04:31:58.729 --> 04:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
um but they are always looking for new
 
04:32:03.050 --> 04:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.050 --> 04:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
um certificates for the growing changes
 
04:32:07.849 --> 04:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
that are happening in the workforce
 
04:32:09.649 --> 04:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
was there any discussion on the on the
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry Workforce
 
04:32:16.130 --> 04:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
Training Center committee
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%

04:32:18.359 --> 04:32:21.410 align:start position:0%

04:32:21.410 --> 04:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
Is there further discussion from the
 
04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
group regarding this bill before we take
 
04:32:26.689 --> 04:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
some action on it
 
04:32:26.699 --> 04:32:28.550 align:start position:0%
some action on it
yeah

04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:32:31.210 --> 04:32:31.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes well let's let's
 
04:32:33.889 --> 04:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters wasn't at the meeting
 
04:32:37.370 --> 04:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
yesterday he was on video
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
um and he did speak to the um growing
 
04:32:43.969 --> 04:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
field of wind and how many jobs it would
 
04:32:47.450 --> 04:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
provide and how in other states that are
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
doing it it's it's very successful
 
04:32:50.159 --> 04:32:52.010 align:start position:0%
doing it it's it's very successful
so

04:32:52.010 --> 04:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:53.570 --> 04:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I would say the um the Marine traits
 
04:32:59.090 --> 04:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
it sounds absolutely amazing
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
um having done some time with the
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
shipyard myself it's definitely a good
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
career field there's definitely jobs
 
04:33:06.490 --> 04:33:06.500 align:start position:0%
that need to be filled in that field
 
04:33:09.890 --> 04:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
that said I don't have any interest
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
personally and further subsidizing and
 
04:33:16.010 --> 04:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
already very expensive energy source in
 
04:33:19.010 --> 04:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
wind energy I think it's entirely likely
 
04:33:21.410 --> 04:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
that if we train energy jobs or rather
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
wind energy jobs here because of the
 
04:33:26.330 --> 04:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
minimal Coastline we have and because of
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the political environment in New
 
04:33:29.449 --> 04:33:29.459 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's entirely likely these
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
jobs are going to leave the state
 
04:33:34.849 --> 04:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
so I would not be for this bill unless
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
we can pull the Marine trades out and do
 
04:33:42.289 --> 04:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:50.449 --> 04:33:50.459 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we noticed was
 
04:33:52.849 --> 04:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
that this commission offshore wind
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
energy Workforce Training Center
 
04:33:58.849 --> 04:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
committee as no legislators on it
 
04:34:04.609 --> 04:34:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
regarding the the commission makeup yeah
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%
oh yeah okay
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
yes represent Woodcock thank you
 
04:34:12.119 --> 04:34:12.830 align:start position:0%
yes represent Woodcock thank you
um

04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
I was I sat through this on the video
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
screen I was I was excited about
 
04:34:19.250 --> 04:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
listening to the option the potential
 
04:34:21.230 --> 04:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
for growth in New Hampshire and growth
 
04:34:23.570 --> 04:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
in the workforce uh in all fields of
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
marine and alternative power options and
 
04:34:28.010 --> 04:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh listening about the bouncing things
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
on the in the ocean uh versus being the
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
stabilized ones uh for options I think
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
this is terrific for New Hampshire uh
 
04:34:36.890 --> 04:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
and I don't concur with my neighbor here
 
04:34:38.631 --> 04:34:38.641 align:start position:0%
to the left about the political
 
04:34:40.250 --> 04:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
political options here in New Hampshire
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.810 --> 04:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh there there was some question uh that
 
04:34:50.269 --> 04:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
several of us had regarding the makeup
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
of the commission but uh correct me if
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
I'm uh if I'm wrong here uh Jen that do
 
04:34:59.631 --> 04:34:59.641 align:start position:0%
the fact this is not a legislative
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
commission we don't have to have elected
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:15.119 --> 04:35:38.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.000 --> 04:35:45.170 align:start position:0%
 
we

04:35:45.170 --> 04:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:49.810 --> 04:35:49.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
seemed to be much more instinctive
 
04:35:56.090 --> 04:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you again
 
04:35:59.209 --> 04:35:59.219 align:start position:0%
thanks just to add to that um it sounds
 
04:36:01.551 --> 04:36:01.561 align:start position:0%
to me that it is a lot like
 
04:36:04.250 --> 04:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
any other program in a CT Center they
 
04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
all have an advisory Council that is
 
04:36:09.890 --> 04:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
sort of out in the field that
 
04:36:11.689 --> 04:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
specializes so there's a bridge between
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
the workforce and what the kids are
 
04:36:16.131 --> 04:36:16.141 align:start position:0%
learning so that's how I view that
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's their makeup or recommended
 
04:36:21.230 --> 04:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
makeup of that advisory Council
 
04:36:23.689 --> 04:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
to the program so it's a little bit
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
different than the one that represented
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
Cornell's on seeing that she's on that
 
04:36:30.410 --> 04:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
as represented from the general court
 
04:36:32.689 --> 04:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
the whole CTE though
 
04:36:35.209 --> 04:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
not one that's right are you doing the
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
whole right it is different yeah it's a
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
little different this one the the reason
 
04:36:42.769 --> 04:36:42.779 align:start position:0%
why the question was brought up was we
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
have an area statue it's 1449 colon 49.
 
04:36:51.051 --> 04:36:51.061 align:start position:0%
which was just passed last year and
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
represented that was represented Evil's
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill on committees and
 
04:36:57.949 --> 04:36:57.959 align:start position:0%
commissions and as stated within that
 
04:37:01.730 --> 04:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
any new commissions or committees which
 
04:37:03.529 --> 04:37:03.539 align:start position:0%
they use the word committee to also
 
04:37:05.631 --> 04:37:05.641 align:start position:0%
cover Commission
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
can have no more than 15 members on it
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
no less than five of which over half
 
04:37:11.929 --> 04:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
those members on must be elected
 
04:37:11.939 --> 04:37:13.490 align:start position:0%
those members on must be elected
officials

04:37:13.490 --> 04:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:37:16.250 --> 04:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we have new that's
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
new in legislation so so apparently it's
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
not applicable to this particular
 
04:37:23.449 --> 04:37:23.459 align:start position:0%
thing right here
 
04:37:26.090 --> 04:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
Miler yeah I would move us to ought to
 
04:37:30.769 --> 04:37:30.779 align:start position:0%
pass this I mean it's the bipartisan
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill that's coming out of the Senate uh
 
04:37:37.369 --> 04:37:37.379 align:start position:0%
it it provides uh alternative Workforce
 
04:37:40.369 --> 04:37:40.379 align:start position:0%
work for Workforce path
 
04:37:43.551 --> 04:37:43.561 align:start position:0%
I just don't see the problems one of the
 
04:37:45.650 --> 04:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
things we found that even in the Marine
 
04:37:48.410 --> 04:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
area up in the Lakes area for example of
 
04:37:50.929 --> 04:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
how you're going to begin to have young
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
people begin to learn how to deal with
 
04:37:52.799 --> 04:37:54.709 align:start position:0%
people begin to learn how to deal with
motors

04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
motors
 
04:37:54.719 --> 04:37:55.609 align:start position:0%
motors
Etc

04:37:55.609 --> 04:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:37:58.131 --> 04:37:58.141 align:start position:0%
I just think this is a good thing I
 
04:38:00.109 --> 04:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
don't understand why we're
 
04:38:02.810 --> 04:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
messing around with it
 
04:38:04.670 --> 04:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
I would move to octopath at the
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
appropriate time
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
representative we're still in discussion
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
though yeah I just wanted to add to what
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
you just said my excitement for this was
 
04:38:15.051 --> 04:38:15.061 align:start position:0%
the wind distance industry so if you go
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
north you'll see a lot of
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know wind
 
04:38:19.199 --> 04:38:20.631 align:start position:0%
you know wind
um

04:38:20.631 --> 04:38:20.641 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:20.641 --> 04:38:23.949 align:start position:0%
um
Towers

04:38:23.949 --> 04:38:23.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
from upstate New York there's a lot of
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
going from Lake Champlain all the way
 
04:38:30.650 --> 04:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
over to Canton through Potsdam as you're
 
04:38:33.890 --> 04:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
going from the Lake Champlain area to
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
Ellenberg with further west
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's solid solid turbines the
 
04:38:42.890 --> 04:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
unfortunate thing is the communities
 
04:38:45.410 --> 04:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
down below are all looking like they're
 
04:38:48.170 --> 04:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
bankrupt they've sold the property out
 
04:38:49.609 --> 04:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
they left the land
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
and but Upstate New York's never been a
 
04:38:54.529 --> 04:38:54.539 align:start position:0%
prosperous place so
 
04:38:55.970 --> 04:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
any rate
 
04:38:55.980 --> 04:38:58.490 align:start position:0%
any rate
representative

04:38:58.490 --> 04:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess
 
04:39:03.890 --> 04:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
the idea we're setting up a fund
 
04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
for the the part of which will be used
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
for this commission but my question is
 
04:39:10.029 --> 04:39:10.039 align:start position:0%
who then
 
04:39:13.689 --> 04:39:13.699 align:start position:0%
oversees the com or committee rather
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
who then oversees
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
the committee the money the spending of
 
04:39:22.609 --> 04:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
Etc I'm not sure how this is
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
all work since we're not part of it
 
04:39:34.010 --> 04:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
chairman lud yes looking at line 18 to
 
04:39:40.730 --> 04:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
20 and I agree with representative Lucas
 
04:39:43.250 --> 04:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
it says the commissioner of education is
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
authorized to establish procedures for
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
the use of funds and to disperse funds
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
as recommended by the offshore wind
 
04:39:52.970 --> 04:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
industry Workforce Training Center
 
04:39:52.980 --> 04:39:55.730 align:start position:0%
industry Workforce Training Center
committee

04:39:55.730 --> 04:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
I agree I don't know where the oversight
 
04:40:04.208 --> 04:40:04.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
is it worth amending to put in some
 
04:40:12.410 --> 04:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
elected officials on it
 
04:40:12.420 --> 04:40:14.448 align:start position:0%
elected officials on it
no

04:40:14.448 --> 04:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have some difficulty and we
 
04:40:23.630 --> 04:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
talked to it was mentioned any way of
 
04:40:26.330 --> 04:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
the industrial wind towers we see around
 
04:40:32.448 --> 04:40:32.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is called Ridge line
 
04:40:32.458 --> 04:40:33.890 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is called Ridge line
um Power

04:40:33.890 --> 04:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
um Power
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
um is the most inefficient
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
and we've seen
 
04:40:40.930 --> 04:40:40.940 align:start position:0%
um pictures of
 
04:40:43.368 --> 04:40:43.378 align:start position:0%
blades that have come down and are
 
04:40:45.410 --> 04:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
buried in the ground
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
um what happens after 20 years when a
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
tower is decommissioned what happens to
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
that what we'll find out you know maybe
 
04:40:56.810 --> 04:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
another 15 years I guess
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I I see the same problems with
 
04:41:02.030 --> 04:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and I don't know what the
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
solution is there uh I've read about the
 
04:41:06.770 --> 04:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
problems they're having off the coast of
 
04:41:08.110 --> 04:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
New Jersey
 
04:41:12.050 --> 04:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
with fish and whales dying and no one is
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
really sure of of the reason
 
04:41:18.850 --> 04:41:18.860 align:start position:0%
um and if that's related to the
 
04:41:22.730 --> 04:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
beginnings of installation of offshore
 
04:41:26.930 --> 04:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
wind there so I I have
 
04:41:29.948 --> 04:41:29.958 align:start position:0%
um reservations about
 
04:41:36.110 --> 04:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
04:41:40.128 --> 04:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see the Marine section
 
04:41:46.250 --> 04:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
go down because of a committee on wind
 
04:41:48.650 --> 04:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
Force but I'm having a problem with this
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee because here we are in
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
education it's talked about talking
 
04:41:55.730 --> 04:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
about Workforce training
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's no legislators on this and it
 
04:42:00.530 --> 04:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
reports just to the governor and then
 
04:42:04.128 --> 04:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
the Bia it just sounds like it's
 
04:42:09.288 --> 04:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
in Congress yeah in in this bill and I
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
would really
 
04:42:13.610 --> 04:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
rather divide it and make sure that the
 
04:42:19.128 --> 04:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm in favor of the bill I was going
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
to note that both in the testimonial you
 
04:42:31.250 --> 04:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
heard in the hearing and if you read
 
04:42:31.260 --> 04:42:32.930 align:start position:0%
heard in the hearing and if you read
lines

04:42:32.930 --> 04:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
lines
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
sorry let me refund it here 17 to 19 on
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
the first page the funding is from
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and industries it's not from
 
04:42:45.170 --> 04:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
the state we're not funding it
 
04:42:45.180 --> 04:42:46.190 align:start position:0%
the state we're not funding it
um

04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
I think having a committee to explore
 
04:42:51.890 --> 04:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
offshore wind is not the same thing as
 
04:42:54.170 --> 04:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
setting up offshore win
 
04:42:57.050 --> 04:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
and we need to have people learn and
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
understand and communicate about it
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
um I think it's renewable energy is very
 
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
much the direction we should go in
 
04:43:10.128 --> 04:43:10.138 align:start position:0%
there have been these kinds of wind
 
04:43:10.138 --> 04:43:10.850 align:start position:0%
there have been these kinds of wind
um

04:43:10.850 --> 04:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:12.288 --> 04:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the right terminology
 
04:43:14.810 --> 04:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
is but for lack of better word Towers
 
04:43:17.090 --> 04:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast of Spain for at least
 
04:43:19.970 --> 04:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
20 years and they are very safe and very
 
04:43:22.128 --> 04:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
productive they've been well established
 
04:43:24.650 --> 04:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
and they've expanded over time
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
other countries are way ahead of us in
 
04:43:29.600 --> 04:43:29.610 align:start position:0%
renewable energy we need to catch up
 
04:43:29.610 --> 04:43:30.830 align:start position:0%
renewable energy we need to catch up
[Music]

04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:43:33.850 --> 04:43:33.860 align:start position:0%
representative uh Ellison
 
04:43:36.170 --> 04:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman move the process
 
04:43:39.170 --> 04:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
along I'll second uh there's no emotion
 
04:43:42.110 --> 04:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's no motion on the table you did
 
04:43:44.270 --> 04:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
okay no motion on the table
 
04:43:44.280 --> 04:43:50.570 align:start position:0%
okay no motion on the table
I'm

04:43:50.570 --> 04:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a little I agree with uh Margaret I
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
think she's going to representative
 
04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
prayer the the commission and the the
 
04:43:57.770 --> 04:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
function of the of the task force
 
04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
although is representative uh uh Damon
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
said it's not connected to the
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
government money I just can't believe
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here talking about uh
 
04:44:08.990 --> 04:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
possibly negating a program that's going
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
to teach basic marine technology that's
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
going to prove all kinds of training in
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
addition to Marie Han Solo because of
 
04:44:19.850 --> 04:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
potential whales dying in New Jersey if
 
04:44:21.170 --> 04:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
it makes sense who knows that's the main
 
04:44:23.208 --> 04:44:23.218 align:start position:0%
we're talking about what's going to
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
happen here how we can train our
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
youngsters coming out of high school and
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
call it a young adults or audio high
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
school and college in an inexpensive way
 
04:44:34.128 --> 04:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
to get a high-tech skill and we're
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
saying no we don't want to do it because
 
04:44:38.090 --> 04:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
the committee's not right I think we'll
 
04:44:39.410 --> 04:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
move in the wrong direction I don't know
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
I thought we were all concerned about
 
04:44:43.788 --> 04:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
the environment certainly the uh the
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
same animals are part of the environment
 
04:44:47.330 --> 04:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher you're recognize
 
04:44:48.770 --> 04:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
offer a brief correction I think to
 
04:44:52.010 --> 04:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
something we heard a few minutes ago
 
04:44:53.690 --> 04:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the state is not paying
 
04:44:57.410 --> 04:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
for this line 14 does in fact say uh
 
04:44:58.850 --> 04:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
shall include State Appropriations
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
designated for the purposes of the fund
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
so that there are there will be State
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
funds going toward this
 
04:45:08.930 --> 04:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
CT funds it's cool great
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
any other teacher programs represent
 
04:45:13.250 --> 04:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
Lucas and Anna coming across
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
two points one is just
 
04:45:20.208 --> 04:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
um There Are Places out west that have
 
04:45:22.850 --> 04:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
these windmills and the problem that
 
04:45:24.430 --> 04:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
they're having is they are
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
non-compostable by a group degradable
 
04:45:31.128 --> 04:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
Etc and when one of them comes down it
 
04:45:34.010 --> 04:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
will completely fill a landfill
 
04:45:35.930 --> 04:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
and they don't know what to do with them
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to figure out because
 
04:45:40.730 --> 04:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
they're made to last they don't break
 
04:45:44.448 --> 04:45:44.458 align:start position:0%
down but they don't break down and so it
 
04:45:48.170 --> 04:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
is an issue that's just on the ecology
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
part of it but
 
04:45:50.638 --> 04:45:51.948 align:start position:0%
part of it but
um

04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:54.530 --> 04:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
why do we need
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
to do a committee
 
04:46:01.368 --> 04:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
for industry to figure out what might
 
04:46:03.890 --> 04:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
work it's all industry to figure out
 
04:46:06.530 --> 04:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
whether or not it makes sense especially
 
04:46:09.170 --> 04:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
if it's industry money unless they're
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
looking for our money they could do
 
04:46:13.010 --> 04:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
their own they've certainly done it for
 
04:46:15.170 --> 04:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
all kinds of other programs where
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
industry has gotten together said this
 
04:46:18.590 --> 04:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
is what we want this is what it should
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
look like
 
04:46:23.570 --> 04:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
Etc recommended it to Community College
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
CTE and they've adopted it so why are we
 
04:46:29.448 --> 04:46:29.458 align:start position:0%
getting involved with that part I would
 
04:46:33.170 --> 04:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
love to see the first part go through
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden
 
04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a shame that we are
 
04:46:40.730 --> 04:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
talking so much about anti of this the
 
04:46:42.530 --> 04:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
way that I'm viewing it again it's just
 
04:46:44.570 --> 04:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
my view is that this is the opportunity
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
for an additional Korean technical ad
 
04:46:48.120 --> 04:46:48.830 align:start position:0%
for an additional Korean technical ad
um

04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:53.150 --> 04:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
Pathway to a profession not necessarily
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
being the installer or the wind towers
 
04:46:59.208 --> 04:46:59.218 align:start position:0%
but to study the science of it and all
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
the jobs that go with Marine
 
04:47:05.390 --> 04:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
I don't remember Marine trades
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and so it's another program that I
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
foresee would be run under the Jeff
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
beards Department as another Career and
 
04:47:14.750 --> 04:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
Technical Ed program
 
04:47:17.330 --> 04:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
and let them figure out how that's going
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
to look and their committee like the
 
04:47:22.490 --> 04:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
other committees like culinary arts
 
04:47:26.090 --> 04:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
welding Auto Building Trades they have
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
industry related partners
 
04:47:31.550 --> 04:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
who work with the school and a parent
 
04:47:31.560 --> 04:47:33.070 align:start position:0%
who work with the school and a parent
Representatives

04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
04:47:36.350 --> 04:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
representation to always evaluate and
 
04:47:37.868 --> 04:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
assess the program
 
04:47:41.050 --> 04:47:41.060 align:start position:0%
based on the market
 
04:47:44.570 --> 04:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
and it gives kids opportunities to look
 
04:47:46.970 --> 04:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
for other
 
04:47:46.980 --> 04:47:48.530 align:start position:0%
for other
um Pathways

04:47:48.530 --> 04:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
um Pathways
 
04:47:50.090 --> 04:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
um it's just like Colebrook just got a
 
04:47:51.770 --> 04:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
new CTE Center and I think they're
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
adding I don't remember if they added
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
culinary arts as well but
 
04:47:58.730 --> 04:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
um you know they're looking for the
 
04:48:00.708 --> 04:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
balsam's resort and training kids to
 
04:48:03.170 --> 04:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
start getting into that line of work
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
well you could talk about well what's
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
the point is it food waste uh you know
 
04:48:10.490 --> 04:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's not sanitary it's not this it's not
 
04:48:13.070 --> 04:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
that I think we need to look at this as
 
04:48:14.930 --> 04:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
a program and then let the school
 
04:48:17.690 --> 04:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
districts who are Regional Centers do
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
the rest
 
04:48:23.570 --> 04:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Damon
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
just want to remind everybody that the
 
04:48:27.170 --> 04:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
league of conservation voters supported
 
04:48:30.050 --> 04:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:32.208 --> 04:48:32.218 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to take a caucus for
 
04:49:02.930 --> 04:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.940 --> 04:49:25.788 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
I think this is going to be a vote your
 
04:49:31.070 --> 04:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
just voted as you see it
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
could I just add um
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about
 
04:49:39.958 --> 04:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about
um

04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:42.050 --> 04:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:49:45.288 --> 04:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
and what they're supposed to be doing
 
04:49:45.298 --> 04:49:46.910 align:start position:0%
and what they're supposed to be doing
um

04:49:46.910 --> 04:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
it talks about this to study the need
 
04:49:53.810 --> 04:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
to build and stay up offshore
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
Workforce training centers
 
04:49:56.638 --> 04:49:58.490 align:start position:0%
Workforce training centers
um

04:49:58.490 --> 04:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
but it talks about CTE at the same time
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
um if this committee is supposed to
 
04:50:09.708 --> 04:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
um promote development of the industry
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
and study how to move forward with the
 
04:50:14.448 --> 04:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
industry or if it's
 
04:50:17.690 --> 04:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
um related to CTE because it talks about
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
CTE in line 32 in various but then it
 
04:50:22.930 --> 04:50:22.940 align:start position:0%
also talks about
 
04:50:25.550 --> 04:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
leasing and capital expenditures for
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
facilities and so forth so I'm confused
 
04:50:30.590 --> 04:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
about what this committee does and the
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
fact that as representative pedernal
 
04:50:34.970 --> 04:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
pointed out the commissioner of
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
education is in charge of the funds and
 
04:50:39.470 --> 04:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
distribution of funds but he doesn't
 
04:50:40.970 --> 04:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
even get a copy of the report they
 
04:50:40.980 --> 04:50:43.310 align:start position:0%
even get a copy of the report they
produce

04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
produce
 
04:50:43.320 --> 04:50:48.890 align:start position:0%
produce
no

04:50:48.890 --> 04:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:48.900 --> 04:50:49.690 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:50:49.690 --> 04:50:49.700 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:50:55.390 --> 04:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:00.890 --> 04:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
on 29 times 29 and 30 on page one and
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
then one and two in my page two
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to report to the right
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
the income and expenditures
 
04:51:11.690 --> 04:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
yeah but now what the committee is doing
 
04:51:13.490 --> 04:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
but the commissioner is a member of the
 
04:51:13.500 --> 05:03:12.410 align:start position:0%
but the commissioner is a member of the
committee

05:03:12.410 --> 05:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:15.530 --> 05:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
technology thank you Mr chair I move all
 
05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:30.650 --> 05:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald do you have
 
05:03:31.990 --> 05:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
anything to do
 
05:03:34.970 --> 05:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
yes we just had a great discussion and
 
05:03:36.890 --> 05:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
we heard good arguments on both sides
 
05:03:40.250 --> 05:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
however our CTE programs are largely
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
successful we should support expansions
 
05:03:45.410 --> 05:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
to the program because this would
 
05:03:48.170 --> 05:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
increase the ability of students to be
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
trained in careers and increase their
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
chances of success in the workforce and
 
05:04:03.530 --> 05:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%

representative cascadin yes
 
05:04:55.490 --> 05:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:02.448 --> 05:05:02.458 align:start position:0%
15 years
 
05:05:08.330 --> 05:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.340 --> 05:05:10.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:05:10.010 --> 05:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:18.530 --> 05:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.930 --> 05:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
is anyone doing a Minority Report is
 
05:05:24.410 --> 05:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.490 --> 05:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
SBE 155 relative to adoption of school
 
05:05:35.208 --> 05:05:35.218 align:start position:0%
administrative unit budgets
 
05:05:36.830 --> 05:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
let's have a little discussion on this
 
05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
first I think there's a little bit of
 
05:05:39.000 --> 05:05:43.448 align:start position:0%
first I think there's a little bit of
foreign

05:05:43.448 --> 05:05:43.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
school administrative unit budgets
 
05:05:50.690 --> 05:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
remember we had this budget manager from
 
05:05:54.890 --> 05:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
Penny Baker in here to discuss that and
 
05:05:56.810 --> 05:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
my notes are not really I was listening
 
05:05:58.730 --> 05:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
more to them than not taking notes which
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
I should have taken notes but he said
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
the contracts need Clarity
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
implementation subject to interpretation
 
05:06:08.570 --> 05:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
has Dre been involved in this the answer
 
05:06:10.550 --> 05:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
was no
 
05:06:10.560 --> 05:06:11.270 align:start position:0%
was no
um

05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
Bob at the ballot process is problematic
 
05:06:16.138 --> 05:06:17.990 align:start position:0%
Bob at the ballot process is problematic
um

05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:20.448 --> 05:06:20.458 align:start position:0%
why alternative I'm reading my writing
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
here I need a little cursive here why
 
05:06:25.250 --> 05:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
alternate process for all districts lead
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.878 --> 05:06:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:06:31.070 --> 05:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:34.128 --> 05:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
in basic what is the need for it
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
I don't represent cascaden you don't
 
05:06:47.810 --> 05:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:47.820 --> 05:06:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:52.200 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:07:10.120 --> 05:07:10.130 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:10.130 --> 05:07:11.448 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:07:11.448 --> 05:07:11.458 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:07:14.270 --> 05:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
if you were a single District you could
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
still not amend or change
 
05:07:20.208 --> 05:07:20.218 align:start position:0%
the Warren article in any way prior to
 
05:07:21.410 --> 05:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
05:07:25.490 --> 05:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
and we have in our town certainly
 
05:07:28.368 --> 05:07:28.378 align:start position:0%
throughout the history of the Town had
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
things that were very divided that
 
05:07:32.750 --> 05:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
people were very much in disagreement
 
05:07:36.050 --> 05:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
and by the end of the either town
 
05:07:38.510 --> 05:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
meeting or deliberative session we had
 
05:07:39.948 --> 05:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
come up with a plan that we could
 
05:07:42.770 --> 05:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
support and then passed and so I would
 
05:07:44.510 --> 05:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
hate it
 
05:07:46.610 --> 05:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
for that not to be able to happen it
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
makes sense if it's multiple districts
 
05:07:50.750 --> 05:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
because then you got this one voting
 
05:07:52.490 --> 05:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
this you know amending this way and then
 
05:07:54.170 --> 05:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
that would be chaos
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
but if it's a single District
 
05:07:59.810 --> 05:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason why they can't be
 
05:08:01.250 --> 05:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
done and then come up with something
 
05:08:04.270 --> 05:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
that everybody can agree to and they did
 
05:08:07.128 --> 05:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
recently send me a suggestion for an
 
05:08:07.138 --> 05:08:08.208 align:start position:0%
recently send me a suggestion for an
amendment

05:08:08.208 --> 05:08:08.218 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:08:10.850 --> 05:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
which I can put in
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to do that if
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
everybody here is just planning on
 
05:08:16.610 --> 05:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
idealing this because what's the point
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
but if it looks like people want to move
 
05:08:21.170 --> 05:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
forward at all I will happily put that
 
05:08:21.180 --> 05:08:23.350 align:start position:0%
forward at all I will happily put that
in

05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent cordelli uh
 
05:08:27.770 --> 05:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:32.230 --> 05:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
um I believe we had uh testimony from
 
05:08:36.050 --> 05:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
a representative that this was uh all
 
05:08:37.970 --> 05:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
about transparency and administrative
 
05:08:37.980 --> 05:08:39.890 align:start position:0%
about transparency and administrative
costs

05:08:39.890 --> 05:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
costs
 
05:08:42.010 --> 05:08:42.020 align:start position:0%
um I did
 
05:08:46.670 --> 05:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
go and find the doe report that was
 
05:08:49.850 --> 05:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
referred to the a12d central office
 
05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
Personnel form that does require each
 
05:08:56.650 --> 05:08:56.660 align:start position:0%
fall districts to report the number of
 
05:08:58.090 --> 05:08:58.100 align:start position:0%
superintendents assistant
 
05:09:00.350 --> 05:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
superintendents Finance professionals
 
05:09:00.360 --> 05:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
superintendents Finance professionals
Etc

05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
so they'd already do that reporting to
 
05:09:07.010 --> 05:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
doe each year
 
05:09:07.020 --> 05:09:09.050 align:start position:0%
doe each year
um

05:09:09.050 --> 05:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
I would think it would be easier to make
 
05:09:14.750 --> 05:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
that information post that information
 
05:09:17.890 --> 05:09:17.900 align:start position:0%
for the public then to
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
go all go through all this and have a
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
separate SAU
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
budget vote
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so in this case I think simpler is is
 
05:09:30.240 --> 05:09:31.788 align:start position:0%
um so in this case I think simpler is is
better

05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:09:31.798 --> 05:09:32.570 align:start position:0%
better
um

05:09:32.570 --> 05:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
and so I I think I will vote the same
 
05:09:40.010 --> 05:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Alexis
 
05:09:58.868 --> 05:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
yes I not knowing the name of that form
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents and I had gone
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
through trying to get this information
 
05:10:06.170 --> 05:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
because we were told it's on the website
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
so we went on I platform and we could
 
05:10:12.410 --> 05:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
find the immediate administrator you
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
know the superintendent whatever but not
 
05:10:15.650 --> 05:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
all the things on that list because we
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
had no idea what it was called or that
 
05:10:19.250 --> 05:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
there was a form
 
05:10:21.410 --> 05:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
and we know more than a lot of people
 
05:10:21.420 --> 05:10:23.090 align:start position:0%
and we know more than a lot of people
right

05:10:23.090 --> 05:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:10:23.100 --> 05:10:24.650 align:start position:0%
right
so

05:10:24.650 --> 05:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think the the
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
public can find those but the other part
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
of that is by dividing it out just like
 
05:10:36.170 --> 05:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
we divide out the teacher salaries and
 
05:10:38.330 --> 05:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
the other things it means that they can
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
that section separately it's not it's so
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's transparency number one they
 
05:10:46.850 --> 05:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
can see what it is but number two they
 
05:10:48.288 --> 05:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
can vote on it
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
and that might mean
 
05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
that they don't vote down the whole
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
school district funding if this is
 
05:10:58.490 --> 05:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
rolled into it and they say it's too
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
high but they may vote just on the you
 
05:11:03.050 --> 05:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
know it may save one or the other of
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
them depending upon
 
05:11:07.970 --> 05:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
what the budget is and what people feel
 
05:11:10.730 --> 05:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
but I just it seems to make sense to me
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
where we're voting on teacher salaries
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
and all those other things let a vote on
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
this too and let people see what it is
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
further discussion it represent Myler
 
05:11:24.850 --> 05:11:24.860 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
dealt with House Bill 563
 
05:11:33.530 --> 05:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
in the pre earlier
 
05:11:37.970 --> 05:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
and this committee voted 19 to 1 to itl
 
05:11:42.010 --> 05:11:42.020 align:start position:0%
almost an identical bill from
 
05:11:44.690 --> 05:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
dealing with this topic so I would I
 
05:11:46.128 --> 05:11:46.138 align:start position:0%
would hope that we would con continue
 
05:11:47.448 --> 05:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
that because I don't think it's
 
05:11:49.368 --> 05:11:49.378 align:start position:0%
necessary and I thank representative
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
cordelli for pointing out the report
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
so not seeing any further discussion
 
05:11:59.390 --> 05:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
here representative cordelli do you want
 
05:12:01.850 --> 05:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
to make a motion
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
I would love to
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
I would move it up
 
05:12:08.810 --> 05:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion on the table to itl
 
05:12:10.430 --> 05:12:10.440 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:15:08.890 --> 05:15:08.900 align:start position:0%
has certain requirements
 
05:15:11.750 --> 05:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if
 
05:15:16.010 --> 05:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
this bill is in compliance with that I
 
05:15:17.288 --> 05:15:17.298 align:start position:0%
wrote to
 
05:15:20.170 --> 05:15:20.180 align:start position:0%
director beard
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%

05:15:30.490 --> 05:15:30.500 align:start position:0%
council
 
05:15:35.208 --> 05:15:35.218 align:start position:0%
who has not yet gotten back to us with
 
05:15:37.788 --> 05:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
an answer to my concerns
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
but the whole issue as I mentioned I
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
think prior is relation to what's called
 
05:15:46.730 --> 05:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
digital badging and digital credentials
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
which is clearly what this involves
 
05:15:52.128 --> 05:15:52.138 align:start position:0%
I have issues
 
05:15:55.030 --> 05:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
I can just name off a few of them
 
05:15:58.490 --> 05:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
who can create and upload content
 
05:16:01.730 --> 05:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
who can access and review data
 
05:16:05.448 --> 05:16:05.458 align:start position:0%
can the student or the parents modify or
 
05:16:05.458 --> 05:16:07.930 align:start position:0%
can the student or the parents modify or
delete

05:16:07.930 --> 05:16:07.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:12.288 --> 05:16:12.298 align:start position:0%
information that's on the site who has

ownership of that data
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
can student data be deleted Upon A

account cancellation graduation or
 
05:16:24.350 --> 05:16:24.360 align:start position:0%

who has access to see that information
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
who has abilities to download that
 
05:16:31.550 --> 05:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
information can info personal
 
05:16:34.128 --> 05:16:34.138 align:start position:0%

05:16:36.170 --> 05:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
rented to third parties

third party in the event that the
 
05:16:44.270 --> 05:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
company is merged or acquired it is
 
05:16:46.490 --> 05:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
unclear whether parental consent is
 
05:16:49.010 --> 05:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
required before personal information is
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
collected or disclosed
 
05:16:53.448 --> 05:16:53.458 align:start position:0%
parental consent notice and method for
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
submission is not provided for can
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
parents of minors have access to see
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
what credentials are being added for the
 
05:17:05.400 --> 05:17:06.230 align:start position:0%
what credentials are being added for the
student

05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:17:09.050 --> 05:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's possible that
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
um unfavorable information
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
could be added to the site we don't know
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
and will the student or their parents
 
05:17:18.288 --> 05:17:18.298 align:start position:0%
know about that
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
would parents be allowed to withdraw
 
05:17:22.970 --> 05:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
consent for a further collection of
 
05:17:22.980 --> 05:17:25.430 align:start position:0%
consent for a further collection of
information

05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:25.440 --> 05:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:30.050 --> 05:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
so those are some of my concerns about
 
05:17:30.060 --> 05:17:31.670 align:start position:0%
so those are some of my concerns about
the

05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:34.990 --> 05:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
the system that is being discussed here
 
05:17:37.208 --> 05:17:37.218 align:start position:0%
in general
 
05:17:42.530 --> 05:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
and without further provision for
 
05:17:46.010 --> 05:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
security and privacy related to this
 
05:17:48.170 --> 05:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
information I I can't support it at this
 
05:17:48.180 --> 05:17:50.208 align:start position:0%
information I I can't support it at this
time

05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:17:52.368 --> 05:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
I should turn on my bike though
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
I I got a question for you uh
 
05:17:56.930 --> 05:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli then uh in the
 
05:17:59.690 --> 05:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
amendment was was presented to us by uh
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters
 
05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
it replaces uh paragraph two with a new
 
05:18:04.920 --> 05:18:06.230 align:start position:0%
it replaces uh paragraph two with a new
paragraph

05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
05:18:10.570 --> 05:18:10.580 align:start position:0%
and within that Amendment it speaks to
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
attaining written parental consent
 
05:18:19.490 --> 05:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
and goes on
 
05:18:22.850 --> 05:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
and it talks about uh require the
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
provision of personally identifiable
 
05:18:28.250 --> 05:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
information so if if
 
05:18:30.650 --> 05:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
in fact the parent has provided that
 
05:18:34.368 --> 05:18:34.378 align:start position:0%
consent is the school district or the
 
05:18:38.448 --> 05:18:38.458 align:start position:0%
CTE Center still going to be responsible
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
05:18:42.890 --> 05:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
what happens to that student information
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
is there a liability issue there at all
 
05:18:48.830 --> 05:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm curious I I think as you said I
 
05:18:51.170 --> 05:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
like the intent of this bill
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I'm I also want to know if is
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
that enough
 
05:18:58.850 --> 05:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
new paragraph number two enough to put
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
the onus of all this onto the on the
 
05:19:01.680 --> 05:19:03.770 align:start position:0%
the onus of all this onto the on the
parent

05:19:03.770 --> 05:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
parent
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I think it it helps
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
um but from my mind it doesn't go far
 
05:19:09.958 --> 05:19:11.030 align:start position:0%
um but from my mind it doesn't go far
enough

05:19:11.030 --> 05:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:19:11.040 --> 05:19:11.868 align:start position:0%
enough
um

05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:14.930 --> 05:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
and my concern with these types of
 
05:19:18.708 --> 05:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
systems it does not apply just to here
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
for CTE it's my intention to
 
05:19:23.040 --> 05:19:24.110 align:start position:0%
for CTE it's my intention to
um

05:19:24.110 --> 05:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully next year or the year after
 
05:19:29.410 --> 05:19:29.420 align:start position:0%
depending on what happens
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
to bring legislation that would also
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
affect the community college system and
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
the university system because I think
 
05:19:41.530 --> 05:19:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:44.990 --> 05:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative yeah Mr chair I just have
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
a procedural question and we have the
 
05:19:50.750 --> 05:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
March 28th uh Amendment from Senator
 
05:19:54.050 --> 05:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
Waters and we have been given uh another
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
amendment from representative McDonald
 
05:19:58.610 --> 05:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure how you want to deal
 
05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
with the substance of the bill vis-a-vis
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
these two amendments and how you want to
 
05:20:07.610 --> 05:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
go forward in dealing with these
 
05:20:10.430 --> 05:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
amendments in relationship to the main
 
05:20:13.250 --> 05:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
the main Bill okay the first amendment I
 
05:20:14.990 --> 05:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
spoke to is one that was provided by
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters at the time the bill was
 
05:20:20.270 --> 05:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
presented so I thought I'd look at that
 
05:20:22.250 --> 05:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
first we're not going to take any action
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
on any of this until we have them both
 
05:20:25.550 --> 05:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
explained to us
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
and so that looking at remember 1269 H
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
which is representative McDonald's uh
 
05:20:37.128 --> 05:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
um Amendment uh perhaps we ought to you
 
05:20:39.948 --> 05:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
know does everybody have Senator Waters
 
05:20:39.958 --> 05:20:41.650 align:start position:0%
know does everybody have Senator Waters
Amendment

05:20:41.650 --> 05:20:41.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:20:48.650 --> 05:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:51.830 --> 05:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
I can let's just read that right there
 
05:20:54.110 --> 05:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
what I had
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh then then what we'll do is we'll jump
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
over the senator Waters Amendment right
 
05:21:00.230 --> 05:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
now and go right to represent McDonald's
 
05:21:03.650 --> 05:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and representative McDonald
 
05:21:05.570 --> 05:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh could you please explain what you've
 
05:21:07.610 --> 05:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
done here with your Amendment yes I
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
just now was mentioned some safety
 
05:21:14.208 --> 05:21:14.218 align:start position:0%
concerns that with unattended
 
05:21:16.490 --> 05:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
consequences that differ from the intent
 
05:21:19.310 --> 05:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill as proposed so I hope my
 
05:21:20.690 --> 05:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
Amendment addresses some of those
 
05:21:23.570 --> 05:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
concerns it just adds one sentence to
 
05:21:25.250 --> 05:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
the end of section one that states
 
05:21:27.530 --> 05:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall encourage
 
05:21:29.330 --> 05:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
student involvement in careers as
 
05:21:31.788 --> 05:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
influencers social media models internet
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
personalities or otherwise diminish
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
student safety and the last two words
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
are really the heart of the amendment
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
student safety I am confident that no
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
one wants to endanger or infringe upon
 
05:21:44.448 --> 05:21:44.458 align:start position:0%
the safety of students and this
 
05:21:46.430 --> 05:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is not to discourage students
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
from participating in those kind of
 
05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
activities but it just recognizes that
 
05:21:51.948 --> 05:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
school is not the place to encourage
 
05:21:56.448 --> 05:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so you're you're talking about
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
the platform
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
that they may be using to for their
 
05:22:07.730 --> 05:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
technical education or or that aspect of
 
05:22:07.740 --> 05:22:09.288 align:start position:0%
technical education or or that aspect of
learning

05:22:09.288 --> 05:22:09.298 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:22:13.490 --> 05:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
no platform will be used that's going to
 
05:22:19.250 --> 05:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:20.930 --> 05:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
more than that yeah
 
05:22:23.090 --> 05:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
some of these platforms as well it might
 
05:22:24.770 --> 05:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
not be the platform that's the issue but
 
05:22:26.448 --> 05:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
it's how the student chooses to engage
 
05:22:28.430 --> 05:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
in that platform a lot of these tools
 
05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
can be used for marketing and career
 
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
purposes but there's other students who
 
05:22:34.128 --> 05:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
may be pressured from societal
 
05:22:36.530 --> 05:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
influences to do maybe unsafe behaviors
 
05:22:38.448 --> 05:22:38.458 align:start position:0%
and school isn't the place to encourage
 
05:22:38.458 --> 05:22:43.330 align:start position:0%
and school isn't the place to encourage
that

05:22:43.330 --> 05:22:43.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:47.150 --> 05:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
McDonald excuse my um
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
my age here
 
05:22:53.448 --> 05:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
um but I I would like if you could if
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
you could Define these terms of
 
05:22:56.160 --> 05:22:57.890 align:start position:0%
you could Define these terms of
influencers

05:22:57.890 --> 05:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
influencers
 
05:23:00.650 --> 05:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
social media models internet
 
05:23:00.660 --> 05:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
social media models internet
personalities

05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
personalities
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know how those are used if
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
you could Define those for me I'd
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate it yes and I am willing to
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
play around with the wording of these if
 
05:23:13.670 --> 05:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's something like that that would
 
05:23:15.530 --> 05:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
cause this amendment or the bill to fail
 
05:23:18.788 --> 05:23:18.798 align:start position:0%
but in regards to those terms those are
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
influencers are somebody who through
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
their social media accounts establishes
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
a career where social media itself is
 
05:23:27.530 --> 05:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
the career and the intent was stated
 
05:23:29.930 --> 05:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
that CTE programs are the career and
 
05:23:31.970 --> 05:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
social media is just a tool to advocate
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
for that these are just kind of careers
 
05:23:37.250 --> 05:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
in social media themselves such as
 
05:23:40.430 --> 05:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
posting content online sometimes nude
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
content naked photos and just things
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
like that that would diminish student
 
05:23:44.160 --> 05:23:50.690 align:start position:0%
like that that would diminish student
safety

05:23:50.690 --> 05:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent keskin thanks I have
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
um actually two questions I don't know
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.930 --> 05:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:07.310 --> 05:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
if I might yes go ahead um uh many of us
 
05:24:07.320 --> 05:24:08.448 align:start position:0%
if I might yes go ahead um uh many of us
might

05:24:08.448 --> 05:24:08.458 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:24:08.458 --> 05:24:09.170 align:start position:0%
might
um

05:24:09.170 --> 05:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:11.690 --> 05:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
be familiar with Girl Scout or Boy Scout
 
05:24:15.288 --> 05:24:15.298 align:start position:0%
merit badges and used to have a
 
05:24:18.890 --> 05:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
um a sash you know you sewed your merit
 
05:24:21.230 --> 05:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
badge on this this is like those those
 
05:24:24.350 --> 05:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
badges are now digital and that they are
 
05:24:28.850 --> 05:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
part of a software system where you can
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
add badges for
 
05:24:33.948 --> 05:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
um or credentials for certain things
 
05:24:36.530 --> 05:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
like even you know passing a course in
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
college or things like that
 
05:24:39.480 --> 05:24:41.530 align:start position:0%
college or things like that
um

05:24:41.530 --> 05:24:41.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
right but do you want that all right
 
05:24:49.610 --> 05:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
paper you wouldn't want that or would it
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
be because there's a chance that an
 
05:24:53.390 --> 05:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
outside entity would
 
05:24:57.288 --> 05:24:57.298 align:start position:0%
my concern is that the the privacy of
 
05:25:00.410 --> 05:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
that information if someone I I might
 
05:25:02.868 --> 05:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
not necessarily know what someone is
 
05:25:07.368 --> 05:25:07.378 align:start position:0%
posting as a quote on a credential to my
 
05:25:07.378 --> 05:25:08.750 align:start position:0%
posting as a quote on a credential to my
account

05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
account
 
05:25:10.128 --> 05:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
um you know I want to make sure that I
 
05:25:12.170 --> 05:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
have access to look at that or if I'm a
 
05:25:14.208 --> 05:25:14.218 align:start position:0%
minor that my parent would have access
 
05:25:16.490 --> 05:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
to look at that information those types
 
05:25:21.050 --> 05:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:21.060 --> 05:25:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:25:22.550 --> 05:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:25.070 --> 05:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and I'd like to
 
05:25:28.970 --> 05:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
kind of follow up a little bit with uh
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
what cordelli was speaking of too it's
 
05:25:33.530 --> 05:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
similar but not exactly the same
 
05:25:36.410 --> 05:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
um I can Envision that if we move toward
 
05:25:38.448 --> 05:25:38.458 align:start position:0%
a system as as we say digital badging or
 
05:25:40.430 --> 05:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to create an incentive
 
05:25:43.970 --> 05:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
structure that creates something of an
 
05:25:46.850 --> 05:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
industry standard for hiring practices
 
05:25:49.250 --> 05:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
for saying that this student has this
 
05:25:51.470 --> 05:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
competency and therefore they are good
 
05:25:54.170 --> 05:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
to go in this and the problem is if
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're going if we're going to
 
05:25:58.368 --> 05:25:58.378 align:start position:0%
third-party social media for this sort
 
05:26:01.190 --> 05:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
of thing social media they have their
 
05:26:04.010 --> 05:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
own terms of service that have to be
 
05:26:06.410 --> 05:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
abided by and they don't go by the U.S
 
05:26:08.030 --> 05:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution I can I can speak
 
05:26:09.590 --> 05:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
personally as somebody who has been at
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
one point or another probably suspended
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
from just about every social media
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
platform that exists
 
05:26:14.638 --> 05:26:15.380 align:start position:0%
platform that exists
people

05:26:15.380 --> 05:26:15.390 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:26:15.390 --> 05:26:16.930 align:start position:0%
people
[Laughter]

05:26:16.930 --> 05:26:16.940 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:26:19.670 --> 05:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think I I don't think we want to
 
05:26:22.610 --> 05:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
create a situation where where students
 
05:26:24.170 --> 05:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
in high school need to feel like they're
 
05:26:26.208 --> 05:26:26.218 align:start position:0%
walking on eggshells to at all times
 
05:26:28.550 --> 05:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that their social media
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
presence isn't being compromised in
 
05:26:34.128 --> 05:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
order to go get a job thereafter and I
 
05:26:36.410 --> 05:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
think we need to really be cautious
 
05:26:38.810 --> 05:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
about what kind of
 
05:26:41.570 --> 05:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
sort of social control over job
 
05:26:43.730 --> 05:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
functions we're providing to third-party
 
05:26:43.740 --> 05:26:47.690 align:start position:0%
functions we're providing to third-party
companies

05:26:47.690 --> 05:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
yes represent cascadden um
 
05:26:53.030 --> 05:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
just to add air information and I don't
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
know if this
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
solves what you're thinking but a few
 
05:26:59.690 --> 05:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
years back actually before I
 
05:27:01.850 --> 05:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
I want to say I don't know maybe five
 
05:27:03.288 --> 05:27:03.298 align:start position:0%
six years ago
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
it was a law that said all school
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
districts had to create data security
 
05:27:08.280 --> 05:27:09.890 align:start position:0%
districts had to create data security
plans

05:27:09.890 --> 05:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
plans
 
05:27:12.650 --> 05:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
and they had to inventory every single
 
05:27:14.448 --> 05:27:14.458 align:start position:0%
piece of software that was being used in
 
05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
the district and then we had to purchase
 
05:27:20.570 --> 05:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
goguardian which flags every individual
 
05:27:23.570 --> 05:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
student that might use a word
 
05:27:27.170 --> 05:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
that might not be appropriate like
 
05:27:30.050 --> 05:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
if they did a an essay and in the word
 
05:27:31.850 --> 05:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
they had
 
05:27:33.530 --> 05:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
Square no they wouldn't have a swear
 
05:27:35.930 --> 05:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
word like I don't know kill or something
 
05:27:39.410 --> 05:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
that would raise attention to the safety
 
05:27:41.510 --> 05:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the child
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if if their CTE
 
05:27:47.230 --> 05:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
software that is third party
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it go through the same
 
05:27:52.690 --> 05:27:52.700 align:start position:0%
vetting process that all
 
05:27:55.730 --> 05:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
software so I'm trying to see what what
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
what is actually done to vet all of that
 
05:28:01.810 --> 05:28:01.820 align:start position:0%
public software I mean because kids use
 
05:28:04.490 --> 05:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
Prodigy and Naviance and a whole bunch
 
05:28:06.410 --> 05:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
of softwares
 
05:28:08.690 --> 05:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
that are a third party but they're
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
vetted first and then there is a guard
 
05:28:12.600 --> 05:28:13.970 align:start position:0%
vetted first and then there is a guard
system

05:28:13.970 --> 05:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:28:16.430 --> 05:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
within the district because we buy that
 
05:28:19.250 --> 05:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
software like a security system where
 
05:28:22.330 --> 05:28:22.340 align:start position:0%
the I.T staff can pick up specifically
 
05:28:25.490 --> 05:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
which student is entering something
 
05:28:27.650 --> 05:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
inappropriate or accessing some
 
05:28:32.208 --> 05:28:32.218 align:start position:0%
accessing something from the outside
 
05:28:36.050 --> 05:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know if that's enough based
 
05:28:38.570 --> 05:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
on the interpretation of this bill or
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
whether this is still required but it's
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
not something as a superintendent I
 
05:28:45.170 --> 05:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
would ever worry about with the
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:53.868 --> 05:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
right I did receive a communication from
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
Jeff beard here
 
05:28:58.850 --> 05:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
back on March 22.
 
05:29:00.650 --> 05:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
and I'll read it seeing I only have one
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
copy here in front of me
 
05:29:05.690 --> 05:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
he says the current proposal is to amend
 
05:29:09.410 --> 05:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
RSA 189 colon 70
 
05:29:12.288 --> 05:29:12.298 align:start position:0%
educational institution policies on
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
social media you need to open up more
 
05:29:16.850 --> 05:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
than social media
 
05:29:20.208 --> 05:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
I would suggest the amendment belongs in
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
RSA 189 colon 66 Roman 5. so if you have
 
05:29:27.890 --> 05:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
that right now you might be looking at
 
05:29:33.730 --> 05:29:33.740 align:start position:0%
that RSA 189 colon 66 Roman 5.
 
05:29:39.530 --> 05:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
RSA 189 colon 66 is the general data
 
05:29:41.448 --> 05:29:41.458 align:start position:0%
inventory and policies publication
 
05:29:41.458 --> 05:29:42.830 align:start position:0%
inventory and policies publication
statute

05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:29:45.410 --> 05:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
Section 5 is the provision that
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
currently requires each Lea to develop a
 
05:29:51.770 --> 05:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
data and privacy governance plan
 
05:29:54.170 --> 05:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
the issue we are running into is the
 
05:29:56.448 --> 05:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
district's data privacy and governance
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
plans are that they have to have signed
 
05:30:04.788 --> 05:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
a DPA agreement with the Consortium
 
05:30:07.310 --> 05:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
this is the broader provision and covers
 
05:30:09.530 --> 05:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
all sorts of platform slash digital
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
tools I agree and if it's possible
 
05:30:16.788 --> 05:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
amending RSA 189's colon 66 would
 
05:30:19.850 --> 05:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
address the issue we've discussed of CTE
 
05:30:21.948 --> 05:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
teachers and students finding it
 
05:30:25.010 --> 05:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
difficult to access industry recognized
 
05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
credential assignment assessments and
 
05:30:30.170 --> 05:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
Industry standard tools such as Adobe
 
05:30:34.910 --> 05:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
Pro and SolidWorks and CTE programs
 
05:30:37.610 --> 05:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
so there there is a recommendation came
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
from him to change where this is is it
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
wise that we take a little bit of time
 
05:30:44.330 --> 05:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
you know represent Cordelia said that he
 
05:30:46.010 --> 05:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
has some issues with
 
05:30:49.270 --> 05:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
personal data I think we all probably do
 
05:30:52.550 --> 05:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
but there's also according to the
 
05:30:54.770 --> 05:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
director here we're going into the wrong
 
05:30:57.170 --> 05:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
area statute
 
05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
represent miler I I think that might be
 
05:31:02.570 --> 05:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
wise I think I I want to go back to the
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
original intent of this bill the
 
05:31:07.010 --> 05:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
original intent of the bill was to
 
05:31:10.610 --> 05:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
provide opportunities for students to
 
05:31:13.128 --> 05:31:13.138 align:start position:0%
get access to platforms
 
05:31:15.770 --> 05:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
that they can't right now and in getting
 
05:31:18.650 --> 05:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
access to those platforms it might give
 
05:31:20.890 --> 05:31:20.900 align:start position:0%
them an opportunity to become certified
 
05:31:24.350 --> 05:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
in a particular line of study or a
 
05:31:27.350 --> 05:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
particular area so I I want to be
 
05:31:29.930 --> 05:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
respectful of Representative cordelli's
 
05:31:31.610 --> 05:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
concerns about privacy we've had that
 
05:31:34.550 --> 05:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
before this committee many times but I
 
05:31:36.288 --> 05:31:36.298 align:start position:0%
also don't want to lose the intent of
 
05:31:39.170 --> 05:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
the bill that allows students to get
 
05:31:41.150 --> 05:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
more than what they currently have and I
 
05:31:44.090 --> 05:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
I thought originally well maybe uh uh
 
05:31:46.430 --> 05:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters Bill dealing with a
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
parent to provide that sense of I was
 
05:31:52.070 --> 05:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay with that so I just I guess uh
 
05:31:53.448 --> 05:31:53.458 align:start position:0%
representative of that I just I don't
 
05:31:57.650 --> 05:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
want to lose the the merits of trying to
 
05:32:00.170 --> 05:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
get students opportunities to gain
 
05:32:02.448 --> 05:32:02.458 align:start position:0%
greater access to what they currently
 
05:32:04.910 --> 05:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
can so that they can advance themselves
 
05:32:06.770 --> 05:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
and their own knowledge and perhaps
 
05:32:08.690 --> 05:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
their own certification opportunity so
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps taking a little more time to
 
05:32:12.650 --> 05:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
look at some of the stuff would be good
 
05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
because I don't I I I like the bill
 
05:32:17.990 --> 05:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill I guess is what
 
05:32:21.230 --> 05:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for yeah I I concur with you
 
05:32:23.448 --> 05:32:23.458 align:start position:0%
I think the bill has real good Merit
 
05:32:24.650 --> 05:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
good purpose
 
05:32:26.330 --> 05:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh if we have some things we have to
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
tweak or get a better handle on we ought
 
05:32:28.970 --> 05:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
to take some time to do that
 
05:32:31.550 --> 05:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you doesn't
 
05:32:34.610 --> 05:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters Amendment refer to RSA
 
05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
189 colon 66 and insert moment six after
 
05:32:39.958 --> 05:32:41.330 align:start position:0%
189 colon 66 and insert moment six after
five

05:32:41.330 --> 05:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
to fix
 
05:32:43.680 --> 05:33:08.448 align:start position:0%
to fix
that

05:33:08.448 --> 05:33:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:08.458 --> 05:33:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:33:09.670 --> 05:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:33:15.708 --> 05:33:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:15.718 --> 05:33:17.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:33:17.470 --> 05:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:33:22.270 --> 05:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand the problem
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
and why we are changing anything I read
 
05:33:26.878 --> 05:33:28.490 align:start position:0%
and why we are changing anything I read
through

05:33:28.490 --> 05:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:33:32.050 --> 05:33:32.060 align:start position:0%
the section you gave us
 
05:33:34.550 --> 05:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
189.665 yeah
 
05:33:37.850 --> 05:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't as far as I can tell say
 
05:33:40.730 --> 05:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
they can't do these things
 
05:33:43.730 --> 05:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
um so I'm wondering is there some is
 
05:33:46.250 --> 05:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
there an RSA someplace else
 
05:33:49.250 --> 05:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
that we're missing but it says that they
 
05:33:51.770 --> 05:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
can't do these things
 
05:33:54.640 --> 05:33:54.650 align:start position:0%
is it 189.74
 
05:33:54.650 --> 05:33:56.150 align:start position:0%
is it 189.74
[Music]

05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:33:59.090 --> 05:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
maybe the one we're working on
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
because refer putting it in five
 
05:34:06.410 --> 05:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
it just says minimum standards for
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
privacy and security of student employee
 
05:34:11.330 --> 05:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
data based on best practices for local
 
05:34:14.030 --> 05:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
education agencies
 
05:34:16.070 --> 05:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
so they have to have they have to
 
05:34:19.550 --> 05:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
develop a dating privacy governance plan
 
05:34:24.050 --> 05:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
Etc but it doesn't say what it is
 
05:34:26.330 --> 05:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
it just says what it has to fi the
 
05:34:28.270 --> 05:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
things it has to take into consideration
 
05:34:31.550 --> 05:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
so according to that we don't need any
 
05:34:33.110 --> 05:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:34:35.750 --> 05:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
so what is it that saying that we do
 
05:34:39.410 --> 05:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
need this stuff and so I guess I have to
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
look at this other 189
 
05:34:52.490 --> 05:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:52.500 --> 05:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:00.000 --> 05:35:02.208 align:start position:0%
 
property

05:35:02.208 --> 05:35:02.218 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:35:02.218 --> 05:35:05.288 align:start position:0%
property
food

05:35:05.288 --> 05:35:05.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:23.050 --> 05:35:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:26.030 --> 05:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
students participating in career Expo uh
 
05:35:28.208 --> 05:35:28.218 align:start position:0%

05:35:31.368 --> 05:35:31.378 align:start position:0%
education May with written per parent
 
05:35:33.770 --> 05:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
consent register for technology
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
technology platforms and services to be
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
used as part of the students program of
 
05:35:41.810 --> 05:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
study so it means if it's part of the
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
program of study I would assume that
 
05:35:46.930 --> 05:35:46.940 align:start position:0%
that's been approved by the instructor
 
05:35:50.750 --> 05:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
or the or the course the program pardon
 
05:35:50.760 --> 05:35:52.150 align:start position:0%
or the or the course the program pardon
me

05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay I looked back at that yeah
 
05:36:05.280 --> 05:36:07.190 align:start position:0%
okay I looked back at that yeah
representative

05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:07.200 --> 05:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
representative
um

05:36:07.910 --> 05:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:10.850 --> 05:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't see why putting it where he
 
05:36:13.330 --> 05:36:13.340 align:start position:0%
suggested we put it makes any sense
 
05:36:16.070 --> 05:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
because really the part that says that
 
05:36:19.330 --> 05:36:19.340 align:start position:0%
they can't do those things is
 
05:36:22.490 --> 05:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
189.70 we says that they can't require
 
05:36:25.128 --> 05:36:25.138 align:start position:0%
or request a student or prospective
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
student to disclose or provide access to
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
a personal social media account
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
but that's a personal one not a school
 
05:36:33.120 --> 05:36:34.868 align:start position:0%
but that's a personal one not a school
one

05:36:34.868 --> 05:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:36:40.010 --> 05:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:51.310 --> 05:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:53.690 --> 05:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
yeah it's an exception obviously I think
 
05:36:54.890 --> 05:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
05:36:58.310 --> 05:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah but the rule has to do
 
05:37:00.590 --> 05:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
right but the rule has to do with
 
05:37:03.410 --> 05:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
personal accounts and we're not talking
 
05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
about personal accounts we're talking
 
05:37:08.208 --> 05:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
about school accounts so I'm not sure
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
how it all fits together are we talking
 
05:37:12.350 --> 05:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
personal accounts
 
05:37:15.650 --> 05:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's my question what are we talking
 
05:37:17.270 --> 05:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
about I think I might be able to help
 
05:37:18.650 --> 05:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit of this because we
 
05:37:20.930 --> 05:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
seem to be getting some wires crossed uh
 
05:37:22.910 --> 05:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
per that uh letter you just read we were
 
05:37:24.590 --> 05:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
talking about some Adobe programs and
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get certification in these
 
05:37:28.368 --> 05:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
according to current law social media
 
05:37:30.350 --> 05:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
account is defined an account service or
 
05:37:32.570 --> 05:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
profile on a social networking website
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
that is used by a current or prospective
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
student primarily for personal
 
05:37:39.050 --> 05:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
Communications Adobe is not a social
 
05:37:40.970 --> 05:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
networking website there is nothing in
 
05:37:42.350 --> 05:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
this current law that would prohibit
 
05:37:45.170 --> 05:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
utilizing that service or obtaining
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
certifications using that service or to
 
05:37:49.670 --> 05:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
count unless you are then trying to link
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
that account to a private social media
 
05:37:54.770 --> 05:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
to perhaps advertise on your social
 
05:37:57.288 --> 05:37:57.298 align:start position:0%
media that you've done some you've met
 
05:38:00.530 --> 05:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
some certification on Adobe
 
05:38:03.288 --> 05:38:03.298 align:start position:0%
he speaks to recognize industry
 
05:38:07.270 --> 05:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:09.948 --> 05:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
recognize credential assessments and
 
05:38:13.368 --> 05:38:13.378 align:start position:0%
Industry standard tools such as Adobe
 
05:38:15.230 --> 05:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
Etc so
 
05:38:17.570 --> 05:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like it's social to
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
me it's not Adobe is not a social media
 
05:38:22.010 --> 05:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
platform right
 
05:38:23.810 --> 05:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and represent
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
Damon um just want to mention that it's
 
05:38:28.250 --> 05:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
not just the Career technical schools
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
that are having an issue with this that
 
05:38:33.470 --> 05:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
um Sunapee I actually went and and met
 
05:38:36.288 --> 05:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
with the I.T director there and and they
 
05:38:39.708 --> 05:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
have courses elective courses like
 
05:38:43.128 --> 05:38:43.138 align:start position:0%
um you know graphic design and they need
 
05:38:45.050 --> 05:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
to download some of these different
 
05:38:47.448 --> 05:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
programs and and the programs with them
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
have maybe badges with you know located
 
05:38:52.970 --> 05:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
with them but um and they're having
 
05:38:54.890 --> 05:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
trouble deciding which ones they can
 
05:38:57.110 --> 05:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
which ones they can't so even though
 
05:38:59.930 --> 05:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's not a social media thing where you
 
05:39:01.368 --> 05:39:01.378 align:start position:0%
know you have friends and you're
 
05:39:03.230 --> 05:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
bouncing stuff over a whole bunch of
 
05:39:03.240 --> 05:39:03.970 align:start position:0%
bouncing stuff over a whole bunch of
people

05:39:03.970 --> 05:39:03.980 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
it still has the the different levels of
 
05:39:11.090 --> 05:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
you know competition or different levels
 
05:39:14.208 --> 05:39:14.218 align:start position:0%
that you get to and and uh drafting
 
05:39:17.390 --> 05:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
programs or coding programs you can get
 
05:39:20.750 --> 05:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
those online for free but there's always
 
05:39:26.110 --> 05:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.368 --> 05:39:30.378 align:start position:0%
it says in in this in um
 
05:39:33.470 --> 05:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
18970 the part where a men looking to
 
05:39:36.288 --> 05:39:36.298 align:start position:0%
amend it defines social and media
 
05:39:36.298 --> 05:39:37.310 align:start position:0%
amend it defines social and media
account

05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
account
 
05:39:41.288 --> 05:39:41.298 align:start position:0%
as one used primarily for personal
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
Communications and yet this amendment
 
05:39:48.890 --> 05:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
put in was for Career and Technical but
 
05:39:51.050 --> 05:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
that's not talking about something used
 
05:39:53.650 --> 05:39:53.660 align:start position:0%
primarily for personal Communications
 
05:39:57.230 --> 05:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
that's talking about something used for
 
05:39:59.890 --> 05:39:59.900 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
platform technology platforms and
 
05:40:05.090 --> 05:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
services used as part of the students
 
05:40:08.810 --> 05:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
program of study and I'm wondering
 
05:40:11.448 --> 05:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
are we putting these in the right place
 
05:40:15.050 --> 05:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
do they I mean one talks about
 
05:40:18.050 --> 05:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
one thing personal primary primarily it
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
says for personal Communications but the
 
05:40:22.368 --> 05:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
stuff they're doing with the CTE is not
 
05:40:24.170 --> 05:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
primarily for personal Communications
 
05:40:28.490 --> 05:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
it's for study right and so
 
05:40:31.990 --> 05:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:35.208 --> 05:40:35.218 align:start position:0%
represented uh Damon did you have your
 
05:40:36.830 --> 05:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
hand up earlier
 
05:40:39.650 --> 05:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
okay represent dry
 
05:40:43.610 --> 05:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you uh can somebody explain to me
 
05:40:47.530 --> 05:40:47.540 align:start position:0%
why the amendment from Senator Waters
 
05:40:50.270 --> 05:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
and the new paragraph on the original
 
05:40:52.910 --> 05:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
Bill are almost identical I think their
 
05:40:54.288 --> 05:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
words are a little different but they
 
05:40:56.990 --> 05:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
say exactly the same thing except for
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill says such technology
 
05:41:01.850 --> 05:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
and services shall have a direct
 
05:41:03.948 --> 05:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
connection to the student content areas
 
05:41:06.530 --> 05:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
of study so why are we putting the same
 
05:41:09.170 --> 05:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
thing in two places if we adopted the
 
05:41:09.180 --> 05:41:12.890 align:start position:0%
thing in two places if we adopted the
amendment

05:41:12.890 --> 05:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:14.810 --> 05:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
05:41:17.390 --> 05:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
so they're not actually entirely the
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
same because in the original bill on
 
05:41:22.670 --> 05:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
line 12 it says Parental opt-in this one
 
05:41:22.680 --> 05:41:23.530 align:start position:0%
line 12 it says Parental opt-in this one
says

05:41:23.530 --> 05:41:23.540 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:41:27.650 --> 05:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
well yeah I'm saying this Senator Waters
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment replaces paragraph two and
 
05:41:32.448 --> 05:41:32.458 align:start position:0%
puts it in a new place
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
so it takes away you just X Out
 
05:41:39.730 --> 05:41:39.740 align:start position:0%
paragraph two and put this amendment
 
05:41:42.350 --> 05:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not the same thing
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
twice you're doing away with
 
05:41:46.670 --> 05:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
it says amend the bill by replacing
 
05:41:48.770 --> 05:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
section two
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
he also changes where to put it it's a
 
05:41:52.430 --> 05:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
different RSA
 
05:41:54.650 --> 05:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
right but this doesn't get rid of oh
 
05:41:57.050 --> 05:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
this gets rid of this in this okay got
 
05:41:58.970 --> 05:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
it got it got it got it thank you so it
 
05:42:01.128 --> 05:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
just moves it to that other place thank
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
you Belcher and then representative Ford
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I may just to briefly
 
05:42:06.350 --> 05:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
recall some of the testimony I believe
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
from from a sponsor
 
05:42:10.970 --> 05:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
um or somebody adjacent they they
 
05:42:13.070 --> 05:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
referred to this colloquially as the
 
05:42:16.128 --> 05:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn Bill none of the things that
 
05:42:18.110 --> 05:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
were described that we've heard so far
 
05:42:20.448 --> 05:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
are social media that would be
 
05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
prohibited under current law LinkedIn
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
however is social media does have a
 
05:42:30.050 --> 05:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
private terms of service they do have if
 
05:42:32.030 --> 05:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken the capacity to collect
 
05:42:36.650 --> 05:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
Badges and such and I think that would
 
05:42:38.448 --> 05:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
it seems to me to be the real purpose
 
05:42:42.770 --> 05:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:45.410 --> 05:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
represent Damon you're sinking
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:50.810 --> 05:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
the way that people communicate today is
 
05:42:56.510 --> 05:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
different in many cases than what most
 
05:42:58.250 --> 05:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
of this committee grew up with and has
 
05:43:00.350 --> 05:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
more familiarity with
 
05:43:02.510 --> 05:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that students can Market
 
05:43:05.390 --> 05:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
themselves for internships apprentices
 
05:43:05.400 --> 05:43:07.490 align:start position:0%
themselves for internships apprentices
jobs

05:43:07.490 --> 05:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
05:43:07.500 --> 05:43:08.750 align:start position:0%
jobs
further

05:43:08.750 --> 05:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:43:08.760 --> 05:43:09.530 align:start position:0%
further
um

05:43:09.530 --> 05:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:12.708 --> 05:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
education is through the digital badging
 
05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we do need to address the
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
considerations that have been raised in
 
05:43:18.770 --> 05:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
the safety
 
05:43:21.410 --> 05:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
but I think we need to do it somewhat
 
05:43:22.850 --> 05:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
expeditiously because we are
 
05:43:24.470 --> 05:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
shortchanging these kids if they don't
 
05:43:24.480 --> 05:43:25.670 align:start position:0%
shortchanging these kids if they don't
have

05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:43:27.890 --> 05:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
this way of communicating
 
05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
05:43:33.410 --> 05:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
I started out by saying I'm not of this
 
05:43:37.788 --> 05:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
world I don't know these programs I I
 
05:43:39.948 --> 05:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't turn on a machine and make any
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
of them work period end of sentence now
 
05:43:47.090 --> 05:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
having said that I hear this discussion
 
05:43:49.490 --> 05:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
in two different ways that they're two
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
separate needs I hear through my wife
 
05:43:55.010 --> 05:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
and all the students she works with the
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
need for digital badging I did you but
 
05:44:01.010 --> 05:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it when you apply for a
 
05:44:04.128 --> 05:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
job is to show that you know it
 
05:44:07.548 --> 05:44:07.558 align:start position:0%
not to have access to it not to be
 
05:44:10.850 --> 05:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
connected to it but that you know how to
 
05:44:13.788 --> 05:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
use it that's what a transcript tells
 
05:44:16.368 --> 05:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
you you know a mathematics you know
 
05:44:18.770 --> 05:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
history you know whatever whatever the
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
thing you have to know is in your
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
transcript it tells you that it doesn't
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
happen to mention
 
05:44:28.010 --> 05:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
digital badges
 
05:44:30.770 --> 05:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if one way to keep people
 
05:44:34.128 --> 05:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
from divulging or be susceptible to and
 
05:44:36.590 --> 05:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
I share your concern about the records
 
05:44:40.010 --> 05:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
being kept off campus so to speak in a
 
05:44:42.350 --> 05:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
private company that profits from
 
05:44:45.048 --> 05:44:45.058 align:start position:0%
manipulating you that's the nature of
 
05:44:46.610 --> 05:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
the business
 
05:44:49.510 --> 05:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
what if you could transfer the badging
 
05:44:53.690 --> 05:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
credits only to the transcript
 
05:44:56.270 --> 05:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
and require that to be listed on the
 
05:44:58.910 --> 05:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
transcript as an official confirmation
 
05:45:01.310 --> 05:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
of expertise
 
05:45:03.170 --> 05:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't have to be the school
 
05:45:05.690 --> 05:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
contract it can be whatever we can
 
05:45:06.948 --> 05:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
create one
 
05:45:10.430 --> 05:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
but the idea is to separate the this is
 
05:45:13.490 --> 05:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
what you have expertise in from the
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
actual thing of oh gee I can click over
 
05:45:17.390 --> 05:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
here and then go into this thing it's
 
05:45:20.750 --> 05:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:23.570 --> 05:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
just an idea
 
05:45:25.430 --> 05:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
05:45:28.730 --> 05:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair yeah I I I think your
 
05:45:30.890 --> 05:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
your suggestion you're in representative
 
05:45:33.948 --> 05:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
miler's suggestion earlier that that um
 
05:45:36.170 --> 05:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
that maybe we get some
 
05:45:36.180 --> 05:45:37.070 align:start position:0%
that maybe we get some
um

05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:39.890 --> 05:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
another amendment uh
 
05:45:42.048 --> 05:45:42.058 align:start position:0%
put together possibly with the
 
05:45:45.170 --> 05:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
assistance of Mr beard
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
um and and to go after and I and I think
 
05:45:49.128 --> 05:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher actually was
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
right on it when he talked about uh
 
05:45:53.570 --> 05:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn and the badges and they use
 
05:45:55.788 --> 05:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
that platform as sort of like a
 
05:45:57.530 --> 05:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
Matchmaker between
 
05:46:01.730 --> 05:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
um employers and potential employees and
 
05:46:01.740 --> 05:46:02.650 align:start position:0%
um employers and potential employees and
and

05:46:02.650 --> 05:46:02.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:05.570 --> 05:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know and it it does sort of speed
 
05:46:07.010 --> 05:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
things along there's still an interview
 
05:46:08.690 --> 05:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
you still got to prove you know what you
 
05:46:10.750 --> 05:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
know but um
 
05:46:13.730 --> 05:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
but that that's how I think a lot of
 
05:46:15.948 --> 05:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
these a lot of our students
 
05:46:18.890 --> 05:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
are connecting with with potential
 
05:46:20.990 --> 05:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
employers and
 
05:46:21.000 --> 05:46:21.730 align:start position:0%
employers and
um

05:46:21.730 --> 05:46:21.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:24.770 --> 05:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
and being able to have that badging
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
process work in conjunction with the CTE
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development programs
 
05:46:33.350 --> 05:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
um but I think getting some support from
 
05:46:33.360 --> 05:46:35.090 align:start position:0%
um but I think getting some support from
um

05:46:35.090 --> 05:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:37.490 --> 05:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
from Mr beard would be I think that's a
 
05:46:39.530 --> 05:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
good idea and I also remember what
 
05:46:41.868 --> 05:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner was speaking to
 
05:46:44.448 --> 05:46:44.458 align:start position:0%
um that they're in my high school in
 
05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
whitual high school they're making
 
05:46:47.628 --> 05:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
canoes right in the high school out of
 
05:46:49.368 --> 05:46:49.378 align:start position:0%
fiberglass and wood strippers and all
 
05:46:51.288 --> 05:46:51.298 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:46:53.628 --> 05:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
um that they race with
 
05:46:56.448 --> 05:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly not a CTE Center
 
05:46:59.810 --> 05:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
but it's also utilizing what's out there
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
on the internet to help them design and
 
05:47:07.128 --> 05:47:07.138 align:start position:0%
and uh even you know to to Market some
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
of those canoes that they're making so
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to this that goes well
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
beyond just CT I think
 
05:47:18.650 --> 05:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
so I just kind of had this Epiphany
 
05:47:18.660 --> 05:47:19.250 align:start position:0%
so I just kind of had this Epiphany
um

05:47:19.250 --> 05:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:21.650 --> 05:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
thinking again about my my colleague
 
05:47:24.350 --> 05:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
here dealing with security Etc
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're not dealing with second and third
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
graders here
 
05:47:30.288 --> 05:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
yeah we're dealing with people who are
 
05:47:33.470 --> 05:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
are getting ready to go to the workforce
 
05:47:36.170 --> 05:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
and so although I want to be concerned
 
05:47:39.708 --> 05:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
about that about about security Etc
 
05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
the age group that that we're focusing
 
05:47:43.970 --> 05:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
in here are these are folks who are just
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
getting ready to go out into the
 
05:47:46.080 --> 05:47:47.448 align:start position:0%
getting ready to go out into the
workforce

05:47:47.448 --> 05:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
05:47:50.448 --> 05:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
and there are risks when you turn on
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
that computer regardless of what you're
 
05:47:53.930 --> 05:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
05:47:57.288 --> 05:47:57.298 align:start position:0%
and so I I I don't know where I came
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
with that but I was just I was just
 
05:48:01.310 --> 05:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
thinking that these are these are almost
 
05:48:02.930 --> 05:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
adults here
 
05:48:05.570 --> 05:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
we need to be concerned I'm not I'm not
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
denying that but we also have to think
 
05:48:09.470 --> 05:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
about what the age group is that we're
 
05:48:12.048 --> 05:48:12.058 align:start position:0%
dealing with here and so
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to share my opinion we
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
also have to go watch out for the
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
computer is owned by the school district
 
05:48:21.170 --> 05:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
and the liability that hangs with a
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
school district for allowing something
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
to occur or that may come back to hit
 
05:48:26.690 --> 05:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
the school district as a result of the
 
05:48:28.490 --> 05:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
parent being ripped off over what
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
happened or the kid themselves
 
05:48:34.430 --> 05:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
so there's there's a lot to this
 
05:48:36.288 --> 05:48:36.298 align:start position:0%
particular issue I think it's wise that
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
we we form a small subcommittee on this
 
05:48:42.530 --> 05:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
right now and find people that would
 
05:48:44.990 --> 05:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
like to work on this and get a hold of
 
05:48:47.448 --> 05:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
Jeff beard and try to square it away
 
05:48:49.788 --> 05:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
because we all agree I think the intent
 
05:48:51.288 --> 05:48:51.298 align:start position:0%
is wonderful
 
05:48:53.930 --> 05:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh we just have to make sure our data is
 
05:48:56.830 --> 05:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
protected and we're allowing access
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
who would like to work with uh is there
 
05:49:02.330 --> 05:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
anybody here would like to actively work
 
05:49:05.208 --> 05:49:05.218 align:start position:0%
on it into this
 
05:49:07.788 --> 05:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
that would long to come in so I see two
 
05:49:14.288 --> 05:49:14.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:17.510 --> 05:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay if if those are before you head out
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
here today would you please come over
 
05:49:21.288 --> 05:49:21.298 align:start position:0%
and give us your names right down right
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
here and we'll record those and then
 
05:49:27.170 --> 05:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
we'll set up a meeting with Jeff beard
 
05:49:29.390 --> 05:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
get going on this and hopefully we can
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
have this come back to us quickly here
 
05:49:37.430 --> 05:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:39.650 --> 05:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
okay I think can I just ask if let's get
 
05:49:41.330 --> 05:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
done as soon as possible because all of
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
the ctes are so concerned because so
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
many students aren't being able to get
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
their credentials and and able to access
 
05:49:51.650 --> 05:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
the platforms that they need to I think
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's in districts that aren't
 
05:49:57.048 --> 05:49:57.058 align:start position:0%
recognizing that it's being used as
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
career platforms and they they can't
 
05:50:02.810 --> 05:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
separate from social platforms which is
 
05:50:04.910 --> 05:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
which is the problem and I think they
 
05:50:08.090 --> 05:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
need legislation to tell them I think
 
05:50:09.230 --> 05:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
it'd be important that we pick somebody
 
05:50:11.810 --> 05:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
out of it over at doe to help us out as
 
05:50:11.820 --> 05:50:12.708 align:start position:0%
out of it over at doe to help us out as
well

05:50:12.708 --> 05:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:50:17.330 --> 05:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh Jeff's great uh on on lot we you and
 
05:50:18.890 --> 05:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
I have not both met and worked with him
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
he's fantastic but let's get somebody
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:23.878 --> 05:50:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:50:26.270 --> 05:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
how do you spell his last name
 
05:50:29.520 --> 05:50:30.948 align:start position:0%
how do you spell his last name
okay

05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:50:32.930 --> 05:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
05:50:35.208 --> 05:50:35.218 align:start position:0%
so we also need somebody who's familiar
 
05:50:38.090 --> 05:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
with the law because some of these like
 
05:50:40.910 --> 05:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
this one part with the ctes neither one
 
05:50:42.890 --> 05:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
of those places is the right place to
 
05:50:44.690 --> 05:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
put it so we need to figure out where to
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
put it so we have access to doe
 
05:50:50.208 --> 05:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
attorneys so we need them too yeah which
 
05:50:52.490 --> 05:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
appeared it didn't work uh afforded
 
05:50:56.810 --> 05:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
information uh to uh Liz Brown
 
05:50:56.820 --> 05:50:58.990 align:start position:0%
information uh to uh Liz Brown
foreign

05:50:58.990 --> 05:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Brown's already been involved
 
05:51:03.288 --> 05:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
with this so she's she's an attorney
 
05:51:06.110 --> 05:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
over doe so she can work with us on this
 
05:51:09.530 --> 05:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
as well I got the memo here from her
 
05:51:12.650 --> 05:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
so with that we're finished what we had
 
05:51:15.650 --> 05:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
to do today uh let's talk about what
 
05:51:18.410 --> 05:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
we're doing in the next week here
 
05:51:20.690 --> 05:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
so everybody's on the same wave like we
 
05:51:24.470 --> 05:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
did receive a new bill today is 218 as I
 
05:51:27.770 --> 05:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning as sb218 we have
 
05:51:29.930 --> 05:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
to have a hearing on that bill
 
05:51:29.940 --> 05:51:31.910 align:start position:0%
to have a hearing on that bill
yeah

05:51:31.910 --> 05:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:51:33.890 --> 05:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
I had to take mine off the web earlier
 
05:51:38.090 --> 05:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:38.100 --> 05:51:40.368 align:start position:0%
 
218

05:51:40.368 --> 05:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
218
 
05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:50.690 --> 05:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh see
 
05:51:55.430 --> 05:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
establishing early educator professional
 
05:52:01.490 --> 05:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.708 --> 05:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
and if the bill establishes in the
 
05:52:05.150 --> 05:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education an early
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
educator professional development grant
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
program towards school districts funds
 
05:52:11.930 --> 05:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
for their local professional development
 
05:52:14.930 --> 05:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:16.570 --> 05:52:16.580 align:start position:0%
a mouthful
 
05:52:19.610 --> 05:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
so that has to be put in the docket here
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
and looking at where we are we do have
 
05:52:28.850 --> 05:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:32.930 --> 05:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh we also excuse me on 419. I'm 419
 
05:52:34.610 --> 05:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's Wednesday
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock we had SP 135 215 216 and
 
05:52:43.250 --> 05:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
272 and anything that came out of this
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we didn't do today would be latched
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
on there
 
05:52:49.850 --> 05:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at we're going to have in
 
05:52:53.150 --> 05:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
Repsol a very busy day on the 18th
 
05:52:56.690 --> 05:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
with 272 that's the parent Rights bill
 
05:52:58.670 --> 05:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to exec that bill the next
 
05:53:00.410 --> 05:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
day I'm going to let things sort of
 
05:53:02.990 --> 05:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
simmer down a little bit and then we
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
will come back and we'll exec that bill
 
05:53:09.708 --> 05:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
on 425 that'd be April 25th when we're
 
05:53:12.830 --> 05:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
doing 266. that's the one we got the
 
05:53:15.470 --> 05:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
side by side
 
05:53:15.480 --> 05:53:16.310 align:start position:0%
side by side
um

05:53:16.310 --> 05:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:20.510 --> 05:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
and so we'll put in 272 on that day and
 
05:53:22.730 --> 05:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
218 as a hearing
 
05:53:24.110 --> 05:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to have that hearing
 
05:53:27.590 --> 05:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
and then we
 
05:53:32.270 --> 05:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
um if we we could possibly exec it on
 
05:53:34.070 --> 05:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
that same day or we may have to come
 
05:53:37.250 --> 05:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
back and exact that at a later date
 
05:53:37.260 --> 05:53:38.570 align:start position:0%
back and exact that at a later date
so

05:53:38.570 --> 05:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
on top of that we're going to have to
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
have this subcommittee right here now
 
05:53:46.610 --> 05:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
I've got McDonnell cordelli Hall leckis
 
05:53:51.670 --> 05:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
were there anybody else over here that
 
05:53:56.750 --> 05:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to join in that that we have to
 
05:53:59.390 --> 05:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
get time with Jeff and Liz
 
05:54:02.090 --> 05:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
are available Patty
 
05:54:07.128 --> 05:54:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:09.770 --> 05:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
I'm scheduling did I hear correctly that
 
05:54:12.368 --> 05:54:12.378 align:start position:0%
the EFA oversight committee was canceled
 
05:54:16.970 --> 05:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
for the 17th yes do we have a a date
 
05:54:18.948 --> 05:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
that's been I don't please who who's
 
05:54:20.090 --> 05:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
chairing that
 
05:54:23.270 --> 05:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
big award Rufus bruises yeah right yeah
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
okay but there's no it hasn't been I've
 
05:54:27.910 --> 05:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
seen it open up do we know why Wisconsin
 
05:54:30.548 --> 05:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
I think just
 
05:54:33.048 --> 05:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
and I think it's workload also on the
 
05:54:36.410 --> 05:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
17th we have a work session we do
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
on 266. that's the side-by-side Bill
 
05:54:42.650 --> 05:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
dealing with adequacy
 
05:54:44.690 --> 05:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
and please look that over I've looked at
 
05:54:46.610 --> 05:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
it since and every time I look at it I
 
05:54:53.410 --> 05:54:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay so when we start this time we're
 
05:54:58.970 --> 05:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
just going to have to go through it and
 
05:55:00.650 --> 05:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to note things where we
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
see changes and write those changes down
 
05:55:04.910 --> 05:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
so when we get through if we have to
 
05:55:06.530 --> 05:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
make amending language or whatever we're
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
going to do with that bill
 
05:55:10.250 --> 05:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
to me it's looking like there's so much
 
05:55:12.110 --> 05:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
there we're almost getting into a
 
05:55:15.048 --> 05:55:15.058 align:start position:0%
retained mode but um
 
05:55:17.030 --> 05:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:55:22.190 --> 05:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
yeah and that will all appear in the
 
05:55:31.670 --> 05:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:36.650 --> 05:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
and let's see 218 that's an early bill
 
05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:44.330 --> 05:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
that one in 151 were the early bills we
 
05:55:46.430 --> 05:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
got to take care of so with that I guess
 
05:55:50.990 --> 05:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:52.788 --> 05:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
05:55:55.670 --> 05:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
no we're good is there a Minority Report
 
05:55:58.128 --> 05:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
on sb155
 
05:56:01.128 --> 05:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
yes Lakers yes
 
05:56:04.570 --> 05:56:04.580 align:start position:0%
I'll make copies of this
