00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
all right uh it's just uh 10 o'clock or
 
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit thereafter and so with that
 
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to open the uh
 
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
The Division III work session on
 
00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is uh the only scheduled topic for
 
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
so um so we're all yours who's who's
 
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
going to start us off
 
00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 align:start position:0%
I did miss Fox Run Away
 
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
Chief LED I asked her a question she
 
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
well my mom always said something like
 
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.550 align:start position:0%
well my mom always said something like
that

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I noticed she didn't drink a whole
 
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
lot of the water she had in front of her
 
00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead you can get started
 
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
are we live well can we check because we
 
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
yes is the answer okay go ahead
 
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh good morning uh Nathan white Chief
 
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer of the Department of
 
00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and I'm joined
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
here today with I'm Katya Fox I'm the
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
Division and uh just to start off just
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
to orient everybody to the documents in
 
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
front of you as we did yesterday
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
um we have the the presentation uh that
 
00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
Katya will be moving us through here the
 
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
The Briefing book for the division for
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health as well and in the
 
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
budget in the governor's recommended
 
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
budget the division for Behavioral
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
Health begins on page 1019 and with that
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
I will hand it over to Katya so we'll
 
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
come back to like 897. so you say we're
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're starting at page what
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh um we're excited to present this
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
information I know that we appeared in a
 
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
pre-meeting or a pre-budget session to
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
go over rapid response which will be
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
discussed as part of this presentation
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
um but that now I can give you a full
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
picture of the work that our division
 
00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
does so
 
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 align:start position:0%
um just the first couple of slides
 
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
you'll see our shared vision
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
um and then on page three really this is
 
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
a um a visual that we've used in a
 
00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways but they all
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
really tell the same story and they talk
 
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
about what our uh goal and our vision
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
and our actual objectives are in how
 
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
they are laid out with starting with
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
prevention going all the way to our
 
00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 align:start position:0%
crisis in inpatient care so we have
 
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
Community Education which is at a
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
general level where
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
um uh population health approach as
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard from Trish Tilly about
 
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
where we do that about resources
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
awareness and
 
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
the skill building
 
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
the skill building
um

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.689 align:start position:0%
um
programs

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
prevention in Early Education we have
 
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
Universal prevention again population
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
Health prevention and then selective
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
prevention for at-risk groups and then
 
00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
some early intervention work that we'll
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about later in the
 
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
presentation Outpatient Treatment I
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
think a lot of you know and are familiar
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
with that that's the office and Clinic
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
settings that we provide services
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
assessment and diagnosis consultation
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
treatment and Rehabilitation
 
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
so so I like this slide I like the the
 
00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 align:start position:0%
the flow part of this yeah um so
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
um if if I were to want to draw on this
 
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 align:start position:0%
uh where I think it's the cans report or
 
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
the cans assessment you know where where
 
00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
it might begin it may I think it may
 
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
begin potentially in every one of these
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
bubbles but it's meant to be an
 
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
integration tool between the bubbles I
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
think and then so and then also is is
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
there uh an I.T system or a combination
 
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
of I.T systems that that Connect the
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
Dots here yes
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
um so the latter there are a combination
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
of systems we have the data systems you
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
reference the cans assessment which is
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the children's
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
um for children's
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
um and Adolescence strengths assessment
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
um is For Children and adolescents yep
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
and then what
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
um what I T Systems then tie this
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
together I assume the closed loop
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
referral system when it goes live we'll
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
do this too yes
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
um that is one of the programs as well
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
as our event notification
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
their providers that's the sheriff and
 
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
so they may hold me out any minutes
 
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
um the event notification where a
 
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
provider can with permission and all of
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
the uh appropriate reviews can notify
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
another provider about an event that has
 
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
happened a change in status of an
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
individual referring to the closed loop
 
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
referral system
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
um there's closer referral but there's
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
also event notification oh okay they're
 
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
distinct okay and and I I'm going
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
through this because I think we've
 
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
talked about it tangentially over the
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
last couple of years but we have some
 
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
new people to division three and the
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
closed loop referral system was a huge
 
00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
topic of conversation and event
 
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.620 align:start position:0%
notification is kind of a a simpler less
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
robust system right yes yep
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
so if you want to just tell us a little
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
bit about that and I'm sorry I'm
 
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
throwing you off your presentation right
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
away that's okay but I just I just think
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
that's a question seeing how how your
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
how your flow because this is really
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
this is really the challenge in New
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire isn't it I mean within each of
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
these bubbles we it feels to me like
 
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
Noble answers and solutions but then
 
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's when we try to integrate this flow
 
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.210 align:start position:0%
it's when we try to integrate this flow
where

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
a chain is only as strong as its weakest
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
link and and I just want to have
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
everyone understand how we how you how
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
we try to manage this
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
great so close loop referrals so that's
 
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
in uh general terms it is care
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
coordination and it's a way to do that
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
through electronic health records and
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
through shared information among the
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
providers of an individual so if you
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
make a referral
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
to another program to address someone's
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
needs then there is a way to be able to
 
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:55.940 align:start position:0%
see all of the
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
efforts that have been made in all of
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
the steps and programs that that one
 
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
individual is accessing so you close a
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
loop by making sure that there's that
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
care coordination when someone is in
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
your care so you know that they did
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
follow up and they did take the next
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
step or that they didn't and there's a
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
way to interact and have that discussion
 
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
with that individual
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
so event notification as you said it's a
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
little bit simpler it's when an event
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
happens and it's a change so for example
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
um someone uh need is discharged from
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital so that's an
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
event notification to the provider to
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
say hey the pro the individual that you
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
are serving did have the hospitalization
 
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
and now is returning to the community so
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's a way to notify of that event
 
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.590 align:start position:0%
it's a way to notify of that event
specifically

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that are most often
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
thought of when we talk about the
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
individuals at the um at the provider
 
00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:05.899 align:start position:0%
level we have our Data Systems
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
which is and I think perhaps Dave
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
weeders talked a little bit about those
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
but we have the data warehouse we have a
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
data system for mental health services
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
we have a data system for the Bureau of
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol services so so that's a
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
whole other area so is is this an area
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
in health care that is the least
 
00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
developed from an electronic health
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
record perspective and so we have most
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
of or much of our records uh stranded
 
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
and sort of a paper-based stovepipe way
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't characterize it as that I
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
would say that there are
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
um different emrs
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
um electronic medical records that
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
providers have
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
um and whether they speak to each other
 
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
or not is a whole other question
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
um so it's always easier as you know if
 
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
we have 10 Community Mental Health
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
Centers for them to all be on the same
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
EMR that's not necessarily the case
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
all right well thanks for that I'll let
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
you get back to a normal scheduled
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
program that's okay
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is just a guide and we're certainly
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
here to answer questions
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
um as as you see fit
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh step up and step down options we
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
refer to this and it's become a
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
shorthand it really is to look at that
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity if someone needs to go up
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
the that means they have a higher level
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
of care it's really about meeting needs
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
and stepping down for example coming out
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire hospital or a
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility and having
 
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:49.820 align:start position:0%
an intermediary step before
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
the crisis and inpatient Services I
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
think you're all very familiar with that
 
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
especially since we were here to speak
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
to you about mobile crisis teams and our
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rapid response system
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
um and we have our inpatient with New
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital in Hampstead and our
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facilities and this
 
00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:16.730 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facilities and this
is

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
the next slide is
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
um the high level view of our
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
organization and so you will see
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
something that's new
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
um so we have had since 2016 The Bureau
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
for children's Behavioral Health drug
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
and alcohol services our policy section
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
which has specialized services in
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and legislation and Rule uh
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Mental Health Services but
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
what's new here is to the far right the
 
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
Bureau of homeless services so this is a
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
recent development it happened probably
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
about a month ago maybe maybe a little
 
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:05.420 align:start position:0%
bit longer and the idea was that
 
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
because a lot of our services hinge on
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
critical housing
 
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
supports and needs that it was the best
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
fit for our division and the bureau used
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
to sit with the Bureau of economic and
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
housing stability I mean the division of
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
Economic and housing stability and now
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
has landed so to speak at home with us
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
so just to understand that a little uh
 
00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:37.970 align:start position:0%
so just to understand that a little uh
deeper

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
deeper
 
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.230 align:start position:0%
deeper
um

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
our citizens can be homeless for a lot
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
of different reasons uh I I think it got
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
placed in your department because the
 
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
most common reason is because they have
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
mental health or behavioral health
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
issues yes but it's not exclusive so
 
00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
like you could end up with somebody
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
who's got you know say a chronic care
 
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
problem and they're on Medicaid and they
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
also happen to be homeless and and they
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
would this department would still try to
 
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
worry about how to how to take care of
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
that absolutely and you'll find that in
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
all of our services
 
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
um for example in our Bureau of drug and
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
alcohol Services we have the impaired
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
driver program not everyone who's in the
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
impaired driver program has a substance
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
use disorder so so in the entire
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
or is this the only entity we would find
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
that is directly responsible for
 
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:41.420 align:start position:0%
managing uh sort of uh
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
the acquisition and assignment of of
 
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:50.060 align:start position:0%
State controlled housing for clients
 
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.769 align:start position:0%
State controlled housing for clients
no

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
um so for homeless services this is that
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
and that's why you see somewhat of a
 
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
name change to homeless Services we do
 
00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.810 align:start position:0%
name change to homeless Services we do
not

00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
um acquire property or have providers
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
acquire property I think um some of um
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to would be in
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
other areas of the state including the
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
and the Community Development Finance
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
Authority they have housing projects and
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of attention was paid when
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
we received the arpa funding and the
 
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
rental assistance that's all outside of
 
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
our department and certainly outside of
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
the division
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
there are other Housing Services also in
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
long-term services and supports
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
in addition to this particular Bureau
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
so if there are multiple departments
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
within the DHHS the the first sort of
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
budgetary or organizational concern
 
00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:54.170 align:start position:0%
budgetary or organizational concern
is

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
the integration of the services to avoid
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
gaps in overlaps and and and this is a
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
relatively new area are you convinced
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
that you've already got adequate
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
coordination so that we don't have gaps
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
in overlaps already
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
yes I think we're going to get there
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
with this new placement of this
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
particular Bureau we have Housing
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
Services in our Drug and Alcohol
 
00:16:24.009 --> 00:16:24.019 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau in our mental health
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
Bureau and what we have already found in
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
the first few weeks is that there is a
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunity to leverage our
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
resources together so that we know that
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
we're meeting an individual's need in
 
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:41.060 align:start position:0%
that a particular
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
program in the federal government that
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
can be matched with another program in
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
depart federal government they can be
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
brought together and brought to bear and
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have duplication of
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
services and that we have more
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
coordination of Housing Services
 
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.030 align:start position:0%
coordination of Housing Services
now

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
um there my feeling on this instinct is
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we probably don't have a good
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
unifying I.T system to help coordinate
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
all that data and and just the
 
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
information part of it is that is that a
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
good assumption and if so what are we
 
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:19.220 align:start position:0%
going to do about that
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
so it's a pretty good assumption there
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
are different requirements there is a
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
management system for HUD for Housing
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
and Urban Development that's required
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
for us to use and then we have in our
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
other programs for example or housing
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
Bridge subsidy program in mental health
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
services that is not even what you would
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
call an I.T system so there's plenty of
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity there to bring that all
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
together we have I'm not that's not an
 
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
area that we have a robust plan but it
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
is something that we're going to be
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
looking at as we have have this
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity here with the with the new
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
Bureau we also are going to be doing
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
some planning in the coming months
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully we get through the budget
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
session and then we're going to do some
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
very very specific planning within the
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
division to address some of these needs
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
in some of the gaps and some of the
 
00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:22.669 align:start position:0%
in some of the gaps and some of the
opportunities

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative Hershey did you have a
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
question I did thank you so much
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious if you have
 
00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:32.419 align:start position:0%
a client who has behavioral health
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
issues who is houseless
 
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
and you can assist
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
in taking away that one
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
stress factor and getting them housed
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
does that
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
bring forth care in a more rapid manner
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
by just getting them housed or is that
 
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.110 align:start position:0%
by just getting them housed or is that
just

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
the tip of the iceberg I guess I I
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that we're seeing
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
that the interconnection of it
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious it's sort of like a
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
chicken and an egg kind of thing I'm
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
just wondering what your thoughts are on
 
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.669 align:start position:0%
just wondering what your thoughts are on
that

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
so I think it really depends on the
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
individual and individual situation but
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is the national model that is
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
housing first and that in order to
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
anyone to begin to address their needs
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
they need to be housed first and stable
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
first so they need you know the the
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
Maslow if you look at the hierarchy of
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
need that you need to have shelter and
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
you need to have food and and that kind
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
of thing and then you can start to
 
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
address some of the more complex
 
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.270 align:start position:0%
address some of the more complex
problems

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
um for behavior in the behavioral health
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
field so
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
um that's um really the approach so
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
would you say that's a priority before
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
we can provide proper care to these
 
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.810 align:start position:0%
we can provide proper care to these
persons

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
I think that what is a challenge and
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see that here is that
 
00:19:59.090 --> 00:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
um housing it it housing is a priority
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
so I was let me just leave it at that
 
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
so it's not just housing right the
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
public health people would tell us that
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
we have the whole social determinants of
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
care and and that housing is one
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
component of that so just to bring us up
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
to speed are you able to like tick off
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
the other major social determinants of
 
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.230 align:start position:0%
the other major social determinants of
care

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
um so there's one
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
yeah um so for economic reasons so
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
um funds you know having a job or having
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
access to Fred to fresh water
 
00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:42.500 align:start position:0%
um and food and I'm sorry yeah
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
I didn't finish education is another
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so yeah yeah but housing is a
 
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
prominent one especially for the
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
population that we serve yeah so so one
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
one of our challenges I think is how do
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
we get people sufficiently stable on you
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
know the hierarchy of needs to where
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
begin to effectively Engage The the care
 
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
component of the system without
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
going so far that
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
were disempowering them as individual
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
responsible people responsible for their
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
own lives you know taxpayers can't step
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
in and wrap everyone up in a in a bubble
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's there's just not enough money to
 
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
go around for that and it may not be
 
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
good social policy
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
but that's that's a that's a different
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
debate all right thank you do you have
 
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
five um so this just shows our full-time
 
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:51.500 align:start position:0%
equivalence in each of the areas
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
so the first we have six within um
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
the at the division level with that
 
00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
policy unit and then you can see the
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
subsequence so we have a total of 54
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
Sean uh I'm sorry on page six where you
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
say You're Building one of your
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
accomplishments was building out the
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
children's system of care that's not
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
meant to imply that it's done no and
 
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
that's um we it should I was trying to
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
use a different word other than
 
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
continued but we're continuing to build
 
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
it out but that wasn't a significant
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
accomplishment is to not only Build It
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%
Up out but Build It Up um we started
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
from scratch essentially
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
um when we and we'll go through that
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
slide on the timeline
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.419 --> 00:22:49.130 align:start position:0%
 
norger

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh sorry I'm still on page five
 
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.270 align:start position:0%
uh sorry I'm still on page five
um

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.549 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
authorized Physicians are these
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
positions filled or what's the status of
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
them are you able to hire people and
 
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
keep them or yeah so we went through a
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
period of time where we had um a
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
significant number of vacancies but more
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
recently we've been able to fill them so
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
we only have a handful that are open
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
right now and there are in active
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
recruitment but we've been doing pretty
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
well and we've been very pleased with
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
the quality of the candidates and have
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
scored some big wins with some
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
individuals who have come from the
 
00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539 align:start position:0%
community and doing direct service at
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
the community level thank you
 
00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:41.930 align:start position:0%
the community level thank you
yep

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Wallner no it's
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
great so if we go to slide seven
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we can talk about the Bureau of drug
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
and alcohol services and you can see the
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
different accounting units that we have
 
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
different accounting units that we have
here

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:01.220 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.230 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:02.390 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
and why don't we just move right along
 
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.230 align:start position:0%
and why don't we just move right along
to

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
so uh bdas as it is affectionately known
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
is a single state
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
um substance misuse Authority that's a
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
designation by the federal government
 
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
and you can see what the goals are they
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
mirror very similar language to the
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
overall Department mission statement
 
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
and again at the bottom of the slide
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
you'll see a familiar theme with the
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
bubbles and looking at the Continuum in
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
the substance misuse system which
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
includes the prevention and education
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
crisis access
 
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
outpatient and residential treatment and
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
then very much a huge part of the work
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
that we do in the community does is peer
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
recovery Support Services as well as
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
family support
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
so I was I was thinking last night about
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
something I might have asked yesterday
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
and it just didn't occur to me the when
 
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:16.340 align:start position:0%
we have people dying from
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
overdoses those are recorded as
 
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:21.860 align:start position:0%
accidental deaths
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's so far it's a true statement uh
 
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious because other states are
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
debating that categorization whether or
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
not they should be considered accidental
 
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
deaths or some form of homicide
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
has your department been involved in any
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
conversations about the proper way for
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
us to be reporting those overdose deaths
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
accidental I think it was implied
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday basically
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
um take some of the onus off of the
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
state for Action whereas something in a
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
more you know closer to what's happening
 
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:03.740 align:start position:0%
this is It's a form of homicide in a way
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
my focus our minds a little bit more do
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
you have do you have any thoughts on
 
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.070 align:start position:0%
you have do you have any thoughts on
that

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
that's something that I'm
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
not with with that categorization so if
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
I recall yesterday director Tilly had
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
indicated that those categories were
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
based off of federal standards and
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines and that's why we had
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
categorized them as such but I know that
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
she I believe she had some level of
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
detail below that but that's why they
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
were showing up in that level
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
um yesterday just based off the
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
direction we get from the federal
 
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:42.470 align:start position:0%
direction we get from the federal
government

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
um and as you know the chief medical
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
examiner is the one who records the
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
cause of death and that becomes the
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
official record
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
and I have not heard what you referenced
 
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.830 align:start position:0%
and I have not heard what you referenced
so

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to okay
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
um so slide nine
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
um this again just another depiction of
 
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.190 align:start position:0%
um this again just another depiction of
the

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
um services that are provided under this
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
Bureau and we have you know I was
 
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
looking at this this morning I won't
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
tell you what time but under prevention
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
and education where you see surveillance
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
so just to take that um head-on that
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
includes the
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
um checks the alcohol checks underage
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
alcohol checks with retailers that
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
you've seen for years and that is
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
funding that we provide to
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission to conduct those
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
checks but not just to do gotchas on the
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
retailers but also to educate them in
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
what signs to look for for
 
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.470 align:start position:0%
what signs to look for for
um

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.930 align:start position:0%
um
underage

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:52.940 align:start position:0%
underage
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
attempts to make purchases
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
so what I think I just heard is that
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
this there's probably Federal money
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
coming in under surveillance that hits
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
your budget and then you transfer it to
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
um just order of magnitude about how
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
much money are we talking about we have
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars budgeted each
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
year okay that that's not a lot for
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
going and surveilling
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
MIP minor in possession we also use
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission funds for that
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
which would not appear they would appear
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
in the governor's commission line but
 
00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:33.419 align:start position:0%
would not appear in the unit that Nathan
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
um so I referenced earlier under Crisis
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
Intervention obviously we have the
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic response treatment
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
services and the impaired driving
 
00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:48.430 align:start position:0%
services and the impaired driving
program

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:51.299 align:start position:0%
that is self-supported by the way that
 
00:28:53.529 --> 00:28:53.539 align:start position:0%
is paid for by the individuals who
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
undergo the program
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
and then support again recovery
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
Community organizations they're
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout the state and have
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
a facilitating organization Family
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:15.620 align:start position:0%
all right just keep looking to make sure
 
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
there are no questions try to pause
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
um page 10
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
um this is called out specifically
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
because there is so much discussion
 
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
around it the state opioid response
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
grant that we receive right now we
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
receive about 28 million dollars a year
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
and that's on the federal fiscal year
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and this is specifically to address
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
um opioid use disorder and they did
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
expand it
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
um more recently to allow us to address
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
individuals with
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
um methamphetamine issues as well but it
 
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
is one of those areas I did hear
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
director Tilly yesterday talk about
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
those categories and the funding that
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
comes through is very specific to that
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
program this is very specific to a
 
00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:08.779 align:start position:0%
population that
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
misuses opioids or meth and so we have
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
to be very careful in our reporting that
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
all of the programs that we Fund in
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
their mult a multitude of them that they
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
are used specifically for those
 
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.090 align:start position:0%
are used specifically for those
individuals

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
so as long as you have our attention the
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's creeping into our
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
opioid situation is the supplemental
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
drug that starts with an m and I've
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
never been good with drug names but the
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
xylazine is at the
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
yeah the one that's being used to
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
stretch the Fentanyl and enhance the
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
effect and it screws up narcan's
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness that whatever that one is
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
would you would you educate us because I
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
think it's a new trend that is worth
 
00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.750 align:start position:0%
think it's a new trend that is worth
understanding

00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
so xylazine is a drug that has been
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
found by the state lab to be included in
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
with the Fentanyl and with other
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
substances and it is a drug that is not
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
a controlled drug it is used by
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
veterinarians for
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
tranquilization and sedation for their
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
procedures and it now it has shown up
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
here it's shown up in other states and
 
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:34.820 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
typically found in and of itself to be
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
used it's usually mixed with something
 
00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:43.460 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
naloxone one of the things that's really
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
important is that naloxone should always
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
be the first line of defense when
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
addressing someone who is believed to
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
have overdosed
 
00:31:56.889 --> 00:31:56.899 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
and so it's something that we're
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
watching and commissioner Quinn of
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
safety has been talking a lot about this
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing some education
 
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
around it just knowing that um
 
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.750 align:start position:0%
around it just knowing that um
individuals

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
may not have any idea what's what
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
they're taking
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
and um so so that's that's that with
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
xylazine it's pretty scary stuff she so
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
in here you have a Community Education
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
component and so this is a huge new
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
thing that really needs educating right
 
00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:35.269 align:start position:0%
thing that really needs educating right
yes

00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
so um there was some funding that was
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
provided I believe it's arpa funding
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
that went to the Department of Safety
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
and they have a no safe experience
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
campaign that either has launched or is
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
about to launch that addresses the very
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.389 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:04.310 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
unless there are any questions about the
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
opioid response Grant I will move on to
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
slide 12 which is the Bureau for
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health
 
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.590 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health
foreign

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
so as I indicated the bureau the
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
division was formed in 2016 and this is
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
the same time the bureau was formed as
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
well previously all of our Behavioral
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
Health Services for children sat within
 
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
the division for children youth and
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
families and it was typically only
 
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
provided to individuals who were
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
involved with gcyf in either child
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
welfare or child protection and so the
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner at that time decided that
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
we really needed to elevate children's
 
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and not have it be
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
just available to those those involved
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
with dcyf so it came out and became its
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
own Bureau I think at the time there
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
were two staff members we've gone up a
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
little since then and we've had some
 
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.089 align:start position:0%
little since then and we've had some
significant

00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:20.810 align:start position:0%
significant
um

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
initiatives that have happened over the
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
last several years
 
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.349 align:start position:0%
last several years
so

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
you need to orient them are they good on
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
that I I I I think I'm looking at page
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
1031 of the but briefing budget or
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
um and one thing that seems different
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
certainly from yesterday is the ratio of
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
of General to federal funds in this area
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh it's roughly you know seven to three
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
um what can you just talk to us about
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
what's going on here from a matching
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
perspective and what we're taking on by
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves as a state sure so in in the
 
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health just kind
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
of speaking at a global level we do
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
receive a number of block grants
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
um and and there's a maintenance of of
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
effort component to those we do in some
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
of our accounts and I'm speaking broadly
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
here I don't know if we want to go
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
through each one we do have some
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Administration that we can
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
claim within some of these accounts we
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
have our soar funds we have a couple of
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
other more temporary funds you'll see a
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
few accounts that are actually fading
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
out because those funds are no longer
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
available but in general
 
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
the difference between public health is
 
00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
a large chunk you know close to 70
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
percent of that is funded through uh I
 
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
don't know how many grants off the top
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
of my head but probably close to 200 or
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
so grants that we have there versus this
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
area where there are only a select few
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
block grants and some Medicaid
 
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
administrative dollars that that we can
 
00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
claim so that's a major distinction from
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday's presentation to make here
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
so so that that implies that there's a
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort requirement in
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
this account or or were you just
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
speaking more generally
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I was speaking more generally
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
um in this account so are you referring
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
to 2052
 
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh it would be under children's
 
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health I see on page 1031 I
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see a line number for the
 
00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:32.180 align:start position:0%
revenues but it's 392 000 of federal
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
which sounds to me like there's some
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
allocation between various grants to to
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
come up with that number no so that's
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
the um the Medicaid administrative uh
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
rate that we can claim here in this
 
00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:46.010 align:start position:0%
rate that we can claim here in this
account

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay and that is independent of the
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
state support or is there a maintenance
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
of effort there to to I I believe that
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
that portion there is a match is that
 
00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.690 align:start position:0%
that portion there is a match is that
correct

00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
yes yes that that that is the match so
 
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
this is a weird match because it's
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
normally at least 50 50 and this this
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
falls short of that
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
there's uh Kyra Leonard our finance
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
director for dbh um it just indicated to
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
me that there's mixed funding here so
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
we're not able to claim that 50 50 rate
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
that you traditionally saw in the
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
Medicaid accounts uh and elsewhere are
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
we leaving money on the table with the
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
match opportunities no all right
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
and we got nine people here to to what
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
extent do these folks coordinate for
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
example with like the Hampstead Hospital
 
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
and other components of of our system of
 
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.410 align:start position:0%
and other components of of our system of
care

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:53.339 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
that's a really good point so um what I
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
should have indicated at the beginning
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the presentation is our very close
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
relationships that we have with both New
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and Hampstead
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital I would say um Rebecca Ross who
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
is um the director of the
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
um the Bureau for children's Behavioral
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
Health is here but those of those nine I
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
would say almost all of them interact
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
with Hampstead in in the coordination
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a very
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
um small uh staff but they're very well
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
cross-trained and
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
um do a great job
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm gonna
 
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
don't overread what I'm about to say I'm
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
going to challenge us strictly from a
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
mean Financial perspective before we had
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampstead we had nine people in this
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
office now we have Hampstead and we
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
still have nine people in this office
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
did we miss an opportunity to to relook
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
our Force structure do we still need
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
nine or did because we added this huge
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
resource in Hampstead that we've maybe
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
obviated some of the need at the at the
 
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
department level I wish it were that
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
that were the case however it's not
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
um The Bureau and the division for
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health are responsible for
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
the community-based services you if we
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
go back to the original Bubbles and we
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
look at where we are in those
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
the Hampstead Hospital is the on the far
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
right side in the inpatient acute level
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
and the Bureau for children's Behavioral
 
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
Health and all of the work that's done
 
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
in the system of care is before it gets
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
to that level and so all of the work is
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
really overseeing
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
um the the programs that help support
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
that and we can go a little bit more
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
into those we have a couple of different
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
ways that you can look at it but this is
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
a system that really has been built is
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
being built as we look at what's needed
 
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:03.500 align:start position:0%
to have that full continuum
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
and Rebecca will
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
um I would be remiss if I didn't say
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
nine is not enough to handle the level
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
of work we do eligibility she has staff
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
that does eligibility for the fast
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
forward program and there is a lot of
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
coordination for residential services
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
which we're responsible for whether
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
someone is dcyf involved or not and
 
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
overseeing all of those contracts and
 
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:34.700 align:start position:0%
all of those placements of children
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and Beyond
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
because you sound so convincing that
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
nine is not enough did you submit to the
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
governor increase request here or what
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
what what would you really need
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that um
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
so I would say no we did not uh for ask
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
for the a position within the within the
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
bureau knowing that um there are
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities to um and we had one
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
instance um in this particular biennium
 
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.829 align:start position:0%
instance um in this particular biennium
where

00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
um a a position can be transferred in an
 
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
existing position that could be
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
um welcome

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
um welcome
 
00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:25.730 align:start position:0%
um welcome
um

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay those are my questions are there
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this area
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
all right do you want me to go on or
 
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
move on to another Bureau
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
did did we I don't know if we hit the
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
whole systems of care I got hung up on
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health yep so this
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
is uh still staying within Children's if
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
um slide 14 we can just look at the
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishments this is talking about
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
um going back to your point is building
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
out no we haven't built it out we're
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
continuing to build out
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
um the system of care and one of the
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
significant efforts that has been taking
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
place is to
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
um establish the residential treatment
 
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.089 align:start position:0%
um establish the residential treatment
system

00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:14.420 align:start position:0%
um and so you can see that in the top
 
00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:18.020 align:start position:0%
accomplishment we have the
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
community-based services through the
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
Care Management entities and this is
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
where I reference fast forward that
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
program which is families and systems
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
together is what that stands for and you
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
may have heard about Trek from uh
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
director ripson talking about the
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
transitional residential enhanced care
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
coordination which is really doing that
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
work for care coordination at the
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
residential and psychiatric treatment
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
level which is um
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
aforementioned Hampstead
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
and then something that's pretty new
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
that we've wanted to do for a long time
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
and now have been able to is looking at
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
the zero to six population and doing
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
care coordination to support
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
those kids as well as their caregivers
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
in more in in the programming that we do
 
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:15.500 align:start position:0%
so so at the bottom of page
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
1031 I'm looking at the funds the
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds are a little over a
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
million State funds are just over 17 5
 
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
million so this this is a relatively
 
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:30.260 align:start position:0%
expensive area
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
given that it doesn't appear that we
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
have a match can can we talk about uh
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
the match situation and what
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
opportunities there might be for other
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
grants to get some support in this area
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
sure so so what if if it's helpful I can
 
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
just walk through each each funding
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
source line if if that helps sure
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
um in so if you look at 23 adjusted
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
authorized uh you'll see the transfers
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
from other agencies this is a system of
 
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
care grant that we actually receive from
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education it goes
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
directly to them from the federal
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
government and that's transferred into
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
this class line the federal dollars you
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
see there that's the administ that's the
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
um the Medicaid administrative rate that
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
we claim
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and and we claim as much as we
 
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
possibly can just to address your
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
earlier point there there's a history
 
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.790 align:start position:0%
earlier point there there's a history
behind

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
um the the the general fund dollars um
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 hb4 had appropriated 13.1
 
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the system of care
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
and then in the current in the current
 
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.829 align:start position:0%
and then in the current in the current
hb2

00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
additional some of the unspent funds
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
were carried forward and then that's
 
00:44:43.609 --> 00:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
reflected within that within that 2023
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and then those funds
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
are continued forward into that 24 and
 
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.510 align:start position:0%
are continued forward into that 24 and
25

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
years as well so so there was a
 
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.530 align:start position:0%
years as well so so there was a
legislative

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:53.540 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
authorization just a few years ago for
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
the system of care support
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
um I want to I want to tie two things
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
together when when we talk about the
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
sununu replacement Center one of the
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
things that there's some hope for is
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
um that the overall system of care as we
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
build it out uh that that's going to
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
reduce the footprint of the number of
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
people who are are kept in the in the
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
future facility
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
um it it when so when we're talking
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
about that system of care is this is
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
this really the preponderance of what
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about as a 17.7 million
 
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.329 align:start position:0%
we're talking about as a 17.7 million
dollar

00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
effort to improve community-based care
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
great good morning Marissa hen associate
 
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.490 align:start position:0%
great good morning Marissa hen associate
commissioner

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad you're bringing this up and
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think that the just one thing I would
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
add to katja's comments first is that
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
as associate commissioner one of the
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
things I do is convene
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%

00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
from dcyf and Kathy Collins the CEO of
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital every other week
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes more often to look for these
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
opportunities for integration it is core
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
to everything we're doing and as Joe
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
described it's really the reason we're
 
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
beginning to get the data to see that
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
the reason we've been able to achieve
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
such a low census a six-fold reduction
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
in five years
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily because those kids
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
are being shifted to residential
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
programs but is because the programs
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
like Fast Forward are offering those
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
wraparound supports to support families
 
00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
underlying needs in their homes and so I
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
think we're beginning to finally get
 
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
that data to show that it's because of
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
the system of care work and the work
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
that Katy and Rebecca have led that is
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
yielding improvements not only for
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
families with behavioral health issues
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
but also those who are interfacing with
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
the juvenile justice system so it's so
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
you've hit the nail on the head in terms
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
of understanding what the vision is and
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
how we're effectuating that in a
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
day-to-day sense
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
so so the challenge for the legislature
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
at least my challenge is trying to
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand what you have internalized
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
because you have been working it day to
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
day for several years and that is just
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
saying seeing that level of integration
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
between the the programs and the efforts
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
and the success metrics and the
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
individual budgets because I think the
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
individual budgets are probably
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
stovepipe representations of various
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of what we're trying to do and
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
so if one was to try to understand the
 
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:41.180 align:start position:0%
connection of the money to the solution
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
efforts that would that's kind of
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to see in in this
 
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.130 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to see in in this
approach

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:48.140 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
I share your your concern and your
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
desire for more data to even get at that
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
sort of return on investment that we we
 
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:56.099 align:start position:0%
need to see and what are the appropriate
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
budgets part of the challenge here is
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is relatively new right so the
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
system of care design was took many
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
years and now we're seeing the fruits of
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
that and so I think it is incumbent on
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
us to be able to understand what the
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
budgetary realities and changes are
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
relative to its impact so would you
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
believe that when I go to national
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
conferences and I ask reps from other
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
states what they're doing with system of
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
care that term means nothing to anyone
 
00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
is that a uniquely New Hampshire term
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
for a concept or I don't think it's
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
uniquely New Hampshire in my experience
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
nationally I think we're among the
 
00:48:31.569 --> 00:48:31.579 align:start position:0%
leading States when it comes to
 
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
achieving the system of care Vision
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
um director ribson was actually invited
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
to a National Conference just last week
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
to present on some of the the
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking work that's been done
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
again with many of those
 
00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
aspects of impact being felt not only at
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
a at an individual family level not only
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the youth being served at
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
Hampstead who are in acute situations
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
but also on the preventive level the the
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
vast reduction in kids entering our
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice System
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
do you want to answer me
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
I I I was just going to say um so so
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
this is of course the first time that
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
I've had the pleasure of of going
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
through this process in my role
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I do have on the books right now next
 
00:49:14.089 --> 00:49:14.099 align:start position:0%
fall to start to look at the accounting
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
structure because you know when we have
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
an activity over here an account over
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
here but it's within the division I I
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that it can be
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
difficult a to manage internally but B
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
from an external transparency
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
perspective to understand how do these
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
things align so I'm going to be looking
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
at that
 
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
um for the for the subsequent budget to
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
see what we can do internally
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
um both from a management perspective
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
while still being able to be transparent
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
with the accounting structure and the
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
way that that is being presented that
 
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
that that is a priority for me in this
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
coming year just so you understand that
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
that will be addressed going forward so
 
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go to representative erf in
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
just a second and and that I I I just
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
want to point out what I think you're
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know and that you're flying in your
 
00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.410 align:start position:0%
you know and that you're flying in your
answer

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:02.420 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
is that during these budget efforts uh
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
the legislature who's been rep or voted
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
in by to represent the public uh this is
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
the our opportunity to make sure that
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
the public has transparency under
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
understands that we're investing the
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
money wisely and to the extent that a
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
lot of this activity is just really hard
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
for us to perceive and to integrate in
 
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
our own minds our ability to explain it
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
and defend it then to the public who's
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
paying for it is just diminished and I I
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
think you get all of that so so I'm glad
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to relook that and good
 
00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:44.300 align:start position:0%
luck because I don't know an easy way to
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
correlate something that's this systemic
 
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
you know but representative
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so this is a
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in budgeting for
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
this this next biennium and that's not
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
even accounting for the fact that it's
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
not clear you'll even spend the FY 23
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
just unauthorized this year
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
can you describe what this extra fund
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
what these extra funds are why there's
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
sure so so I I can just begin
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
um so a significant portion of these um
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
will fall within the contracts line for
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
the fast forward program and care
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
coordination and count down if you want
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
to speak to more specifics
 
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
so um a couple things on this a little
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
bit broader
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
um again as I had said this was a system
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
that didn't exist so now some of the
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
funding that you're seeing was showing
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
up in a whole bunch of different areas
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
um for to meet kids needs now we have
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to contract so before we
 
00:51:53.049 --> 00:51:53.059 align:start position:0%
didn't contract with our Residential
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
Treatment providers now we contract with
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
them and um so some so that shows up
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
here fast forward was a very small
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
program it's rapidly expanding
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that in the in the
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
numbers that we get into with our our
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
slide presentation so
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
um so yeah it's it's something that we
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
are we need to pay for because it's a
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
way to intervene and to get kids the the
 
00:52:27.849 --> 00:52:27.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay I sort of answer the question I
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
guess like because you know is what why
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
is it going up so dramatically
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
um are you expecting to expend the all
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
that adjusted authorized funding and can
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
you tell us maybe not right now but can
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
you let us know what other what are
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
these other areas where things came from
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
and now they're a part of this uh piece
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.450 align:start position:0%
as well
sure

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
um and yes I expect that we will expend
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
all of those funds um we carried them
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
forward because we had the lag time
 
00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:00.740 align:start position:0%
um in getting the system up and running
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
and getting those contracts in place so
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
I expect that we will expend those funds
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
we actually had a prioritized need and I
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
think that Nathan is going to be
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
bringing forth all of our prioritized
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
needs in a package to you when you have
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to talk about those to
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
actually have additional funding for
 
00:53:21.609 --> 00:53:21.619 align:start position:0%
those Residential Treatment providers
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
because they
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
um the the rate that was initially put
 
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
into those contracts is proving not to
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to support the provider's
 
00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:36.010 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to support the provider's
needs

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:36.020 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Staffing again
 
00:53:42.049 --> 00:53:42.059 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage the ability to staff
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
up as well as all the increased costs
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
this number of General funds in 24 17
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
million 779 110
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
implies tremendous specificity
 
00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:08.579 align:start position:0%
how how did we come up with a number of
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
this specific why isn't it just a
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars instead of a hundred and
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
ten for example
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if there's necessarily
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
um an easy answer I can get the details
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
behind them if you'd like the ground
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
level details to show I don't need the
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
details I'm just trying to hear how
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
detailed what your methodology and
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
process is to come up with a number this
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
precise and something that seems
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
pretty diffuse and difficult to put a
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
ES

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.569 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:02.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:05.339 align:start position:0%
um so so vast majority of it is is based
 
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
on the actual contract the price
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
limitations that that we have
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and and then there's there's a couple
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
of under other underlying subtleties
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
behind those figures but but it is based
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
on on actual data it's not just we chose
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
a odd number to to determine what the
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
amount should be
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
all right thank you of course I know I I
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
realize it's a hard question but and
 
00:55:28.809 --> 00:55:28.819 align:start position:0%
that's something you're going to be
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
diving into in August September anyways
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out how to rationalize
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
all of these organized organized
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay any questions here I I think we can
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
go on
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
okay and I um first slide uh 15 just
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
again the key challenges that um we have
 
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
seen in the reports I think you have
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
seen in the headlines about the increase
 
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
in the number of Youth experiencing
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
people ask me why
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
we all grew up we did not have the level
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
of behavioral health problems at least
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
not so publicly and so openly
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm just and so people ask me why
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
what has happened
 
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.770 align:start position:0%
what has happened
um

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:23.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
smartphones for 12 year olds is it you
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
know is it uh the breakdown of two
 
00:56:32.829 --> 00:56:32.839 align:start position:0%
parent families is it you know what what
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
why are we having these problems what
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
what can we do systemically to try to
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
make a healthier Society
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think it is so complex so it's what
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
you said in much much more
 
00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:51.059 align:start position:0%
um and one um thing that comes to mind
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
is those bubbles again when we look at
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
prevention and we look at building
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
resiliency in our children so that um
 
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
although we're not going to be able to
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
take away phones and social media we
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
certainly can build the resiliency in
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
our children so that those don't have a
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
significant impact and I don't remember
 
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
in my time period in generation that we
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
had anything as significant
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
but this is this has been trying yes the
 
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:27.500 align:start position:0%
pandemic was problematic and uh
 
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
exacerbated issues but I think I think
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
we've been on a trend for quite a long
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
time and I to what extent are we
 
00:57:38.809 --> 00:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
investing in trying to really make sure
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
we understand the drivers of the trend
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
to try to come up with uh solutions to
 
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
problems rather than spending money on
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
symptoms because it feels like a lot of
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is potentially money being spent to
 
00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
address symptoms of a much bigger
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
problem rather than addressing the
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
underlying problems themselves that's
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's my feeling
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so um we're not undergoing research
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
studies within the division but there is
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
there are ongoing studies and there's
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
Research into that again we're trying
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
from what we do have the ability to
 
00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:22.460 align:start position:0%
impact which is looking at prevention
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
and looking at those evidence-based
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
practices that help help in for the
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
future today and the future
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
so if we had research for example that
 
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
said it's probably not a good idea to
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
have kids under the age of 16 with
 
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.530 align:start position:0%
have kids under the age of 16 with
smartphones

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
smartphones
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
just as an example
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
should we be issuing Public Health
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
warnings or advisories or putting it
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
into our community uh education efforts
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
that that one of the things that may be
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
contributing to some of this are
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
the Technologies in the hands of people
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
unable to cope with
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
the access to the world it's creating
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think that when we have evidence and
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
the research behind it that it's our job
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
to educate the public it's not to
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily vilify one particular
 
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
thing such as cell phones or alcohol or
 
00:59:31.849 --> 00:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
tobacco but really to look at all of our
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
public policy and our laws surrounding
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
those yeah so just so you know
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
technology has always been a problem
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
right I mean when cameras came out there
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
was all this societal concerns about
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
privacy because cameras were available
 
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
and then the transistor radio broke kids
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
away so they weren't listening to
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Welk they were listening to
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
Elvis Presley so technology is always
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
kind of on at the at the cusp of a lot
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
of the social change I'm just again I I
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
I just I just want us to have a healthy
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
society and I it feels it to be truly
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
truly cynical what you might hear
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
somebody say in a quiet moment is that
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
um the the the the the the first
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
motivation of any organization is to
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
grow and so we're creating a behavioral
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
health industry whose objectives is is
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
like any other organization is to grow
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
are we are we compounding a problem
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
or addressing a problem I that that
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's the big thing I wrestle with and
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's it's not an answer for today uh
 
01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
but but that's I just wanted to put it
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
out there is that that as we talk to the
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
public there are there are cynics
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
amongst us that think that we've CR
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
we've we've created an industry that's
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
now self-perpetuating so
 
01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.230 align:start position:0%
now self-perpetuating so
um

01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:02.579 align:start position:0%
representative walner thank you
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
I was wondering what
 
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a response to that
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
um and because I think there's research
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
that shows about children who grow up
 
01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
and so we talk about the Aces and so we
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
talk about adverse childhood experiences
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
and I think it's now become so common in
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
our vernacular that we just say Aces and
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
we don't talk about what aces are so
 
01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:43.940 align:start position:0%
Aces include sexual abuse physical abuse
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
verbal abuse
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
and a whole a whole array of services
 
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.609 align:start position:0%
and a whole a whole array of services
having

01:01:51.609 --> 01:01:51.619 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
domestic violence in a home having
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
someone with a substance misuse disorder
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
in your home so there's a whole array of
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
service of research that looks and tries
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
to quantify
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
those experiences to determine what
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
impact they have on individuals as an
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
adult but then you have to also factor
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
in those protective factors and that's
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
why I keep talking about the prevention
 
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
and the protective factors because those
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
are so important for children as they
 
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.289 align:start position:0%
are so important for children as they
grow

01:02:23.289 --> 01:02:23.299 align:start position:0%
grow
 
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
and the and really trying to mitigate
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
those adverse experiences with positive
 
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
other perfect protective factors in
 
01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:40.630 align:start position:0%
other perfect protective factors in
prevention

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
thank you chair two questions first is I
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
think I heard the chairman ask relative
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
to federal funds what additional grants
 
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
are out there can you provide I mean
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is a 90-10 actually it's
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
more like 95 to five percent right
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
funded through state
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
is there a way for you to let us know
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
and if we invested in a grant writer or
 
01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
something else would there be access to
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
Greater federal funds question one
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
so I I know Nathan wants to respond one
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why this is so heavily
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
reliant on General funds is because
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
they're not Medicaid reimbursable
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
services so when we have the opportunity
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
to have a service and Bill Medicaid then
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
we can say it's 50 50. but a lot of
 
01:03:31.329 --> 01:03:31.339 align:start position:0%
these services are not eligible for that
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
we may have some opportunities to open
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
up some what is known as opening up
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
codes that we could turn on which costs
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
money but does also allows us to draw
 
01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:46.940 align:start position:0%
down that other 50 percent
 
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
and and I I from uh from a capacity
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
perspective generally speaking it's not
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
that we need more grant writers
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
um I I think we have many people within
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
the department that are capable of that
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
um when we do identify grants we always
 
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
look at what are the associated
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
requirements because sometimes there's
 
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
really heavy reporting and that could be
 
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
programmatic aspects that could be uh
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
Financial aspects that that do you know
 
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
do have a burden and so
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
um a grant itself if it's a really small
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
dollar amount it could cost us more to
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
actually administer it because we have
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
audit requirements that we're going to
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
deal with for the next couple years
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
Associated we have quarterly reporting
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
requirements we have you know whether
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
they're Financial programmatic we have
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
the accounting information that we have
 
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
to deal with the invoices resulting from
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
any contracts that have to be reviewed
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis so two hundred
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars towards a specific
 
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
purpose for a Federal grant may look
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
good on paper but we always have to ask
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
the question what does that take away
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
because there there are dozens of other
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in the
 
01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
administration of every grant that comes
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
um and then secondly
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
what would it take if we wanted you guys
 
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
to do additional research relative to
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
what are the underlying causes
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
um right would this be another person
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
how do we prioritize trying to make sure
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at the system inputs
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to just re being in a
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
reactionary mode there's a lot more
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
return on investment for dollars and and
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
time and and precious resources when
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
you're addressing the underlying factors
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
that are that are driving this and is
 
01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
that another person what is that to make
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's a per a state
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
staff person because we don't
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily have those skills nor would
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
we want to acquire I'm probably pretty
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
expensive Endeavor we do have a number
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
of Consultants that we have worked with
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
and who are currently contracted with us
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
to evaluate our programs to see if
 
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
they're effective in getting the
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
outcomes that we desire so we have that
 
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.270 align:start position:0%
outcomes that we desire so we have that
happening

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.089 align:start position:0%
happening
um

01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
we oh I struggle and personally struggle
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
when we put money into research and
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
evaluations when we have such a great
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
need for the services on the ground and
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
what role should my division have and
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
what um role should the department have
 
01:06:25.089 --> 01:06:25.099 align:start position:0%
in conducting that research versus
 
01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
providing services to our to our
 
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.170 align:start position:0%
providing services to our to our
citizens

01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
I understand that
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
um that the issue right of trying to
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
deal with real world needs
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
versus right trying to find out what's
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
causing these but if you want to solve
 
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
the problem long term right when you're
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
constantly fighting the fire a real
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
world needs you never get ahead of it
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
the problem just continues to grow so
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
even a small amount invested early on
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
has a huge return long term because who
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
knows maybe this is a breakdown of the
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
family that's going to be a tough
 
01:06:59.089 --> 01:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
problem to solve with in the department
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
for instance right single-family homes
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
versus traditional two two parent homes
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
that that is not an easy knob that you
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
guys might be able to adjust but if it
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
comes down to
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
screen time broadly speaking as a father
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
of teenage children
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I right that may be something where
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
Health advisory notices and helping
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
parents understand that hey it's it's
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
good for for young boys to go outside
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
and play with right play in the front
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
yard and run around because burning off
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
that excess energy is helpful as opposed
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
to that excess energy being diverted
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
toward misbehavior
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
so um believe me I I totally support the
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
research I think it's happening and I
 
01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
think it's happening at the national
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
level with a variety of different think
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
tanks so what we can do is bring back
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
some of that research that's ongoing and
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
following up on something else she said
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
I wanted to see if I understood it
 
01:08:04.849 --> 01:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
correctly you talked about opening up
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
codes to me that may mean that their
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
services that would be eligible for 50
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
match under Medicaid that we don't
 
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
currently offer in the state of New
 
01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.570 align:start position:0%
currently offer in the state of New
Hampshire

01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
um can you first is that correct and
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
second can you uh do you have any
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
examples of of any of those are there
 
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
any of those that you think should be
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
seriously considered
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
so your assumption was correct and I
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
would need to come back to you with
 
01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
those examples
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
so because I love this slide on slide
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
three and it's kind of related to to the
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
conversation we just had
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
um your your bubbles don't include the
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
need to do uh or the authority related
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
to original Research into the causation
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
the societal causation right so
 
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
um but what would be nice is to know
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
that somewhere in the department there's
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
a group or an individual trying to
 
01:09:10.739 --> 01:09:12.590 align:start position:0%
a group or an individual trying to
monitor

01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
um what's going on in Academia
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh and and looking for you know the the
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
Strategic problems and and and to have
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
dialogues about maybe strategic
 
01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.150 align:start position:0%
dialogues about maybe strategic
Solutions

01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
Solutions
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
and and I get where you're coming from
 
01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:30.140 align:start position:0%
Miss Fox here
 
01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
you're busy right and and so so this is
 
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
probably some deep thinker somewhere
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's just looking at the big picture
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and we have contracts with the
 
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire already I
 
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
don't know what all of those contracts
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
provide I assume some of it is uh we're
 
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
already paying for uh coordination and
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
assistance from the research Community I
 
01:09:58.510 --> 01:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
I I I just
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we find a way to try to
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
get up out of the day-to-day and look
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
in the big picture but
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's not anything for you to respond
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
to there that's just me yakin
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and our associate commissioner does
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
want to respond but I will say we can
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
we have contracts with the institute on
 
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
disability at UNH we have contracts with
 
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and um I think Dartmouth Medical
 
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
Center and we have a contract with
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
Brandeis so we do have Partnerships with
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
our academic institutions for a variety
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
of reasons um and importantly the the
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
evaluation component so I will um I will
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.169 --> 01:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
um I want to say that I appreciate this
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
dialogue because I think the the
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
emphasis on getting upstream and The
 
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
Importance of Being evidence-based is um
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
is crucial to this conversation
 
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
I have a doctorate in public health uh
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
the reason as someone who's academically
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
rooted that I wanted to come to this
 
01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
position just under two years ago was
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
because of the in large part the
 
01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
commitment of of Katya of our
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the whole department in
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
in connecting to that rigorous
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
data-oriented standards so well while
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
Katya is modest and I think
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
appropriately so in um in making sure
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
that you know she's connected to the
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
research we are engaged not only
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
um connected to an array of national
 
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:34.610 align:start position:0%
um connected to an array of national
bodies

01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
um and contributing to learning
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
collaboratives and various conferences
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
and so forth but actually New Hampshire
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
is being called on in many different um
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
respects to provide our expertise to
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
National decision makers and other state
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
leaders on how they can learn from the
 
01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
success that we've yielded the system of
 
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
care probably being one of the most
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
important areas where we've been able to
 
01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
stand that up so quickly with such fast
 
01:11:59.630 --> 01:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
effects that other states want to know
 
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
how we're doing that
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and so I think the whole at one other
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
thing I just want to emphasize from
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
earlier in the conversation the entire
 
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
premise of the system of care is to
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
engage preventively to reduce Reliance
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
on institutional settings and to connect
 
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
kids with the services they need in
 
01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
their communities in a trauma-informed
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
family-centered way so I just want to I
 
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
want to say that we agree violently
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
vehemently with what you're saying
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's really the whole premise here
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and as Joe also alluded to because
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
because dcyf is as connected to the
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
system as anyone five years ago if Joe
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
ribsum's team wanted to connect a family
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
with Services there had to be an actual
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
allegation or an open case around abuse
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
or neglect talk about misaligned
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
incentives I mean we've come so far in
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
terms of being able not only through the
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
Bureau of children's Behavioral Health
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
and through the whole Continuum to be
 
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
able to support families early but also
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
doing so through the preventive services
 
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
that he talked about so I just want to
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
say we agree totally I think it's
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
embedded in everything we're doing and
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate Katya not wanting to
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
overstay our engagement in research and
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
data everything from you know the yrbs
 
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
youth behavioral risk surveys that
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
Trisha Tilly helps connect us with we
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
are we are reviewing that data regularly
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
we are committed to um to an
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
evidence-based approach
 
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.830 align:start position:0%
evidence-based approach
thanks

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
not not to not to make light of what you
 
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
just said but just to make light of the
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
intensity of the problem
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'm really looking forward to in a month
 
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
from now you're coming back with the
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
three things we need to do at a societal
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
level to fix the problem so if you could
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
just fix the problem we wouldn't need to
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
spend as much money that way that's all
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
um that sounds like a much deeper
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
research project than most phds ever
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
undertake yeah yeah are all right so I'm
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna let you get going again
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to apologize for making
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
this a very unusual budget briefing but
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't look at these programs
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
and these numbers without trying to
 
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
figure out where are we going what what
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
are we trying to do as a state you know
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
and how do we explain this to the public
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
so so thank you representative walner
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you before we uh go past page 15.
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
could you just talk a little bit about
 
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
the shortages in our that our
 
01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
contractors are having and I mean we've
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about the state itself the
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
state employees and the difficulty we're
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
having but what about the services we're
 
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
buying from providers in the community
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
what kinds of problems and can you talk
 
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
what kinds of problems and can you talk
about

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
what that what what
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
what's causing
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
um what causes that to happen in
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to help them
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to speak more generally about
 
01:14:59.810 --> 01:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
Workforce across the entire
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
um Division and all the services that we
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
provide and I think you're going to hear
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
from the community Behavioral Health
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
Association after we present this
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
morning but I think that everyone goes
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
quickly to wages and wages certainly are
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
a significant issue they were an issue
 
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic they've been an
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
issue post pandemic and they um they are
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
contributing factor
 
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
this idea that we're in a mental health
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
crisis I think makes it very
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
unattractive to want to go into the
 
01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:42.050 align:start position:0%
unattractive to want to go into the
field

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's that as a factor I
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
think that we do not have
 
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
um the numbers that we need of
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who are going into the field
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
and that can be for a variety of reasons
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
so there are so many different
 
01:15:59.209 --> 01:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
strategies that the Endowment for health
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
has convened a really a Workforce effort
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
and initiative to look at across the
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and Fields the why
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing this but we do know
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
that wages and a supportive work
 
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
environment are a significant
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
tools that can be used but we really
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
need to grow the workforce I think that
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
we see increased demand but we don't
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
have the numbers that are coming in we
 
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
have also in speaking to Maggie
 
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
Pritchett who's going to speak after me
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
she was saying we just people are
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
retiring they're just retiring they've
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
reached that age the people who entered
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
this field have been there they've been
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
there a long time and and there are some
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
how do we encourage
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
I guess public education to
 
01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.030 align:start position:0%
I guess public education to
um

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
encourage people to go into these fields
 
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
and what are the universities or the
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
colleges doing
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
to help us get a Workforce
 
01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
so I think there have been particular
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
universities and college systems in the
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
state that have started programs and are
 
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
you are actively recruiting certainly
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
having settings in which they can train
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
are important one area of shortage has
 
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
been at the bachelor's level and most of
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
our a lot of our requirements are around
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
Master's level and so we we end up
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
seeing that the bachelor level
 
01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:51.130 align:start position:0%
seeing that the bachelor level
um

01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:51.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
clinicians or Frontline staff there's
 
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
High turnover because of that okay I get
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
my training ground and then I can move
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
on to another position that's either a
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
career advancement
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
um or is
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
um frankly less stressful
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
so there you know there's some if
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
anybody had this um figured out then we
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have this problem and that's
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
why there have been so many initiatives
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
in so many ways um that people are
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
trying to address it not just in New
 
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you uh based on that in terms of
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
the schools that are graduating students
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
that are in subjects relevant to your
 
01:18:38.699 --> 01:18:40.189 align:start position:0%
that are in subjects relevant to your
department

01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
just ballpark do you feel as though
 
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
you're getting most from New Hampshire
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
schools or outside of New Hampshire or a
 
01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
combination a ballpark percentage I'm
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
not looking for execs I wish I knew on
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
that number but I do think I'm again
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
following on the community Behavioral
 
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
Health Association they do a Workforce
 
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
report on a monthly basis and they talk
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
about the recruitment
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
um and so Maggie might be able to Ms
 
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
Pritchard might be able to answer that
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
question more directly
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know I think um I did see
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
um with the Endowment for health and
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
that initiative around Workforce that um
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
it's it's really
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
um not the attracting people from out of
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
state that's happening that is filling
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
those open positions that it really is
 
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
people from from New Hampshire
 
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
and that our efforts to go recruit and
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
talk about the the you know dream that
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to be making it more
 
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.850 align:start position:0%
we're going to be making it more
attractive

01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
um to come over from Vermont uh per se
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
um that that's that's putting a lot of
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
effort into very little gain and the
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
gain should be here uh within the state
 
01:19:57.649 --> 01:19:57.659 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very quick follow-up very
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
related does the University system of
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the community college
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
system support the programs that you
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
I I can't answer that blanket they do
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
support programs that we do need
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
for example the School of Social Work at
 
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.630 align:start position:0%
for example the School of Social Work at
UNH

01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
UNH
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
um but I would have to probably get back
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
to you I'm more specific if there's a
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
gap in a particular program thanks
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
point my sense on that from friends on
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
the education committee is we have major
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
components all throughout the system
 
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
like in high school and and into the
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
community college system and they're
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
trying to bridge all that stuff I I
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
suspect like any time you have workflow
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
you're trying to make sure that you can
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
coordinate between the the bubbles
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and just overall we I think even in
 
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
there we have a capacity issue so even
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
if we have a component of the solution
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
there's probably a capacity issue there
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
so it's my guess
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay Miss Fox you you said something
 
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
very gentle in there and and I want to
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
understand if you had a bigger point you
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
were trying to make you mentioned the
 
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
dream of expanding our Workforce in New
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I it made me wonder if you
 
01:21:21.719 --> 01:21:22.850 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I it made me wonder if you
were

01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
referring to the idea that we could make
 
01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
a massive change in licensures and that
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
that would be a magnet to draw people
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
from out of state right if you weren't
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
meaning to mention that then then that's
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
okay I just but if that's what you were
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
referring to I I'd like to hear your
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts so no um I wasn't but I do
 
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.970 align:start position:0%
thoughts so no um I wasn't but I do
dream

01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
dream
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
um but I do dream of a robust Workforce
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
um often
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
um no it was just that we put so much
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
emphasis on thinking that we're going to
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
attract individuals from other states to
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
move here to take on this work
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
um the data doesn't support that in the
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
work that the endowment has done in that
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
matter it really talks more specifically
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
that our best recruitment tool is to
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
um to use all the resources we have in
 
01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:14.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
to have New Hampshire
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
residents take on this work
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
um however you brought up the licensure
 
01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
obviously there are a lot of barriers
 
01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:28.100 align:start position:0%
that have been identified for Workforce
 
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
and that we have a narrow view of
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
Workforce and that what our requirements
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
were 20 years ago of who could do what
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
need to change and we've have some
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
efforts going on in looking at doing
 
01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
career ladders but also looking at our
 
01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:47.540 align:start position:0%
peer Workforce
 
01:22:51.010 --> 01:22:51.020 align:start position:0%
which are
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
underutilized and could be expanded so
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
that they have the opportunity to
 
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
conduct some of the work that needs to
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
be done at the community level
 
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
so I keep forgetting the term are you in
 
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
the second area are you referring to
 
01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
standards of care or practice standards
 
01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
of practice or I forget the term what we
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
call we have something that refers to uh
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
each job having an evaluation of which
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
kinds of care they can provide within
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.290 align:start position:0%
 
categories

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
is permitted to do what who can develop
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
a treatment plan who can sign off on a
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
treatment plan and
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
Etc so so that's a potential area that
 
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
we might also want to supplement some of
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
our state work on is trying to
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
reevaluate I God I wish I remember the
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
term practice scope of practice that's
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
the term I'm looking for so a kind of a
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
reevaluation of scope or practice who
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
who in the department might take a lead
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
on on sort of a scope of practice review
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
so I think there are some efforts under
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
that are um going on through the office
 
01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.739 --> 01:24:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
um office of professional licensure and
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
certification so that's under a
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
different department within the state
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
um and governor sununu also in his
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
budget address talked about some changes
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to see so there's a lot
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
of work happening in this space
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure within who in our
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
department is on point for that
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
what I was wondering was
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
um what is the department doing about
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
contracts and increasing
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement to the contractors so
 
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
that they can I mean part of part of the
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
problem is Wages not all of the problem
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
is Wages but part of it is and
 
01:25:03.169 --> 01:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
if we can't if those Community providers
 
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
do not have the resources to pay their
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
the people who work there
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna have this is going to
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
continue this will continue so what is
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
in this budget for increases to the
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
people we contract with
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
so specifically so I know um there are a
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
lot of discussions and director Lipman
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
was here on Monday to talk about
 
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates and that's how providers
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
get paid in many instances and those
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
rates have to cover wages so that's
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's one aspect you don't see it in my
 
01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:41.060 align:start position:0%
budget you see it in the Medicaid budget
 
01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
in this particular budget there are many
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
areas that support wages one that is a
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
prioritized need that was not funded in
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
the governor's phase of the budget was
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
for those Residential Treatment
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
providers for children's Behavioral
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
Health and so we had to ask over the
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
biennium for 25 million dollars to be
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
able to increase those
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
contracts with those that particular
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
was that a prioritized need that was not
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
included in this budget correct thank
 
01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:20.270 align:start position:0%
included in this budget correct thank
you

01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
I think we've thrown you off your track
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's all right can you
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
find where we were I know where we were
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to skip us a little bit
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
further beyond that because again we
 
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
have the visual depictions of the
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health System Of
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
Care on
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
on both P well we can go we can skip I
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
think 16 17 and 18 unless anyone
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
um wants to focus on those areas and we
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
can go straight to 19.
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
these are um just to show these next few
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
charts are to show the growth of the
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
programs we've talked about fast forward
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is the wraparound services at the
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
community level and as you can see that
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
and on page 20 which is the Trek program
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
which is for
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
residential transitions
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
that also has continued to grow
 
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
and when I say I want to talk about this
 
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
growth we had projected growth and then
 
01:27:31.129 --> 01:27:31.139 align:start position:0%
we have growth and this is reflecting
 
01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
growth beyond what was projected
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
which is great because people are
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
getting the services that they need
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
page 21. this is the uh what I talked
 
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
about the zero to six program and it
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
just launched and so you can already see
 
01:27:56.890 --> 01:27:56.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
and that concludes the Bureau for
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health and we can
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
move on to the Bureau of Mental Health
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
Services which addresses the adult
 
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
population if that works
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
um so some of this is going to be
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
familiar to you as we appeared before
 
01:28:20.110 --> 01:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
you about a month ago
 
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
so this is again Mental Health Services
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
across the Spectrum looking at the adult
 
01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.570 align:start position:0%
across the Spectrum looking at the adult
population

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:28.580 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
and individuals who have a severe mental
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
illness or a co-occurring substance use
 
01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.649 align:start position:0%
illness or a co-occurring substance use
disorder

01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:39.980 align:start position:0%
um on page 23
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
this is really looking at the
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
accomplishments again the crisis
 
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
response system the Step Up step down
 
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
programs which includes those Beds which
 
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
are the transitional beds between higher
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
levels of care and local levels of care
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
and community
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
there has been we talked a lot about
 
01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
housing and we say you know there's just
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
not enough housing we have been able to
 
01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
even despite the challenges with housing
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
we've been able to increase the beds for
 
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing for individuals with
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
severe mental illness and so you can see
 
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.129 align:start position:0%
severe mental illness and so you can see
that

01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
um we have the critical time
 
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
Intervention Program which is something
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
that was talked a lot about in the last
 
01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
biennium and that sorry that implemented
 
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
is spelled incorrectly that I just see
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
right now sorry about that
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
um but CTI is really looking at helping
 
01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:40.100 align:start position:0%
with the transition from
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
a designated receiving facility
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire hospital into
 
01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:46.940 align:start position:0%
the community to address
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
Fair I'll pretend it's ice cream
 
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:02.990 align:start position:0%
Fair I'll pretend it's ice cream
um

01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
your bullet point regarding supported
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
housing from 760 beds or 63 to 1007. can
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
you ex where are those beds right
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage of mental health beds
 
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
right at the broader level help me
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
understand how you're solving it here so
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
we can apply those elsewhere sure
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so what we were able to do is work
 
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
with our community mental health centers
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
and we had um contracted with them for
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
them to each stand up six additional
 
01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
beds in their regions for a total of 60
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
beds I think 48 or so over 40 have come
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
online that are reflected here and
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
they've had a variety of different ways
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
in which to stand up those beds we
 
01:30:47.930 --> 01:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
didn't dictate it had to be XYZ we said
 
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
here is the requirement six beds you
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
know what is your plan so some of those
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
beds have been Pier lead beds so that's
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
pure respite beds some of those beds
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
um the traditional community the
 
01:31:06.729 --> 01:31:06.739 align:start position:0%
residents Beds which provides
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
the on-site staff and supervision and
 
01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:13.090 align:start position:0%
the on-site staff and supervision and
services

01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:13.100 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
and then there's been independent
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
housing as well so it's a variety we
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
have broken that down in the past and we
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
can do that in and indicate what region
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
has done has done what with that with
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and so then moving on to again you've
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
seen these slides the New Hampshire
 
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:42.900 align:start position:0%
rapid response model the key component
 
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
being that it's really simple is that
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
you have a place to call you have
 
01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
someone to respond based on that call
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
and that you have somewhere to go we've
 
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
done a really good job in standing up
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
rapid response on the call center the
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis teams and now where our
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
area focus is somewhere to go which is
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
Crisis stabilization and so that's not
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
just um that's the housing is is longer
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
term somewhere to go is Crisis
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
stabilization is looking at more that
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay let's get you into a place where
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
you can have that assessment you can
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
have that breather and we can work with
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
you on your next steps
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
so since that Court ruling came out I've
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
monitored some social media discussions
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
about this and
 
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
some folks are saying oh the mobile
 
01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
response teams are going to be a big
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
part of solving this patient warehousing
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
problem and this and this makes my head
 
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
hurt because I don't I don't see how
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's a part
 
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.570 align:start position:0%
that's a part
of

01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:52.580 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:55.340 align:start position:0%
improving the bed capacity
 
01:32:57.050 --> 01:32:57.060 align:start position:0%
can you
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
sure I'd be happy to address that so all
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
of the community-based services that are
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
um in this division are based on trying
 
01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
to address people's needs at the lowest
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
level of care necessary having an
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
intervention well before anyone needs to
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
hit an Ed and it reaches an acute phase
 
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis and the rapid response
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
system was stood up because we knew that
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
people were showing up in EDS who didn't
 
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
need that level of care they didn't need
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
to go just like you can go to urgent
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
care or you can go make an appointment
 
01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
with your PCP rapid response is an
 
01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:41.699 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take care of someone's
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
needs right in the community right there
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
it may even be taking care of their
 
01:33:48.169 --> 01:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
needs on the phone and having that
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
personal connection so
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I do think it does divert people from
 
01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
the emergency departments all right that
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
so um on the next slide just getting a
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more into critical time
 
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:08.300 align:start position:0%
intervention and the timeline
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
just for
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
um your
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
um what's not appearing here and in
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
slide 26 is the numbers we've had 205
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
people who are currently enrolled in
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
that program which is a nine month
 
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
program and we've had 25 who've actually
 
01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
completed the program and this is a
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
program that's carried out and is inter
 
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
woven with our community mental health
 
01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.649 align:start position:0%
woven with our community mental health
centers

01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
are there any questions here I I just
 
01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:41.219 align:start position:0%
hoping somebody would ask so I wouldn't
 
01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
okay I I just three sentences on what
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
what what is what's the per the point of
 
01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
the CTI program and
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
so as we talked about in the show I
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if this counts towards my
 
01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.430 align:start position:0%
don't know if this counts towards my
three

01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
um in the children's
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
um Behavioral Health really looking at
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
that care coordination
 
01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
um in between steps and the transitions
 
01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:08.780 align:start position:0%
this is care coordination that's done
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
between the facility level and the
 
01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.729 align:start position:0%
between the facility level and the
community

01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
so it is helping someone and having
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
someone to talk to maneuver through
 
01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
renting up an apartment or making sure
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
that they're applying for eligible
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
Services ensuring that they have job
 
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
searches and how they can go about doing
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
that so so this is getting them out of
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
the institutionalized care back into the
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
community yep so on the on slide 26
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's a a bubble on the bottom right
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's just three month HS and I'm just
 
01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:45.410 align:start position:0%
that's just three month HS and I'm just
curious

01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
curious
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
is that a typo or am I just needing to
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
expand my vocabulary
 
01:35:55.729 --> 01:35:55.739 align:start position:0%
yes oh there we go three months some
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
formatting issues here sorry no that's
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
all right I I just
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if it was a new
 
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
acronym you know so all right keep going
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so looking at the key challenges
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
within this particular bureaus work
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the increased demand
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
which we've talked about the workforce
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
shortages we've talked about and The
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
Limited available housing and what I
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
want to point out with that all despite
 
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
our efforts and our success in standing
 
01:36:30.850 --> 01:36:30.860 align:start position:0%
up beds there still aren't enough
 
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
housing units available we have a
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
housing Bridge subsidy program which is
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
just that it's a it's a bridge for
 
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
someone who has is eligible for the
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
housing Choice vouchers which was
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
formerly known as Section 8 and
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
um they so it's a bridge until they
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
actually are able to get that voucher
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
from the FED federal government
 
01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
and we pay a portion thereof of that
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
rent we have a
 
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
um people who've been approved who have
 
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
yet to be able to lease up because they
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to find an affordable
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
or an available apartment and so we have
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
about over a hundred people who have
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
been approved are eligible for that
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
program and have yet to be able to
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
on page 27 I'm sorry if I missed it what
 
01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:28.139 align:start position:0%
is the um
 
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
the blue line versus the Orange Line
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's the difference between adults and
 
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:38.649 align:start position:0%
it's the difference between adults and
children

01:37:38.649 --> 01:37:38.659 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:37:44.110 --> 01:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want to let you get out
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
of this section and until you you tell
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
us what you think we know and what we
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
think we don't know yet about the court
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
order and what the potential
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
implications are for recommended
 
01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
solutions to address the court order and
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
what kind of money might we expect to be
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
demanded uh here in a few months or
 
01:38:13.199 --> 01:38:14.330 align:start position:0%
demanded uh here in a few months or
weeks

01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
sure I I spoke with the the chief legal
 
01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
counsel for Health and Human Services
 
01:38:21.649 --> 01:38:21.659 align:start position:0%
before I came here and uh just to make
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
sure I didn't get in trouble
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and she told me at this
 
01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
point in time we really can't speak
 
01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
um to to the specifics of the plan as
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's currently being developed
 
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I know that's not helpful for this
 
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
um I know that's not helpful for this
committee

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
committee
um

01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
I I cannot tell you a dollar amount
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
because I do not know what the plan is
 
01:38:40.739 --> 01:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
because I do not know what the plan is
yet

01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
um however I I do think that um we can
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
when Ellen Lapointe with New Hampshire
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
hospital comes here next week I believe
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
for scheduled for Wednesday Wednesday
 
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.310 align:start position:0%
for scheduled for Wednesday Wednesday
currently

01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
um that we can have a have some
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
discussion about what are the challenges
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
with with the um the workforce that they
 
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
have there and some of the bed capacity
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
um one one thing that I think may just
 
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
may feed into that conversation just to
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
make everybody aware of now
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
is this past legislative session New
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital actually was provided
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
the Authority for Recruitment and
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
Retention incentive payments
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
um for staff that work there however we
 
01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
don't currently have any funds budgeted
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
um we we did have a couple of
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs included in our budget
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
um that and all that Ellen speak to this
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
when she comes before you but that would
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
certainly provide them with a little bit
 
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
more flexibility
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
um when it does come to trying to
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
compete with with the nursing uh labor
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
market that's out there
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
search trivia question why why when they
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
got that Authority wasn't there a joint
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee request to
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
transfer money is because there was no
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
more money to to be transferred or was
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
it an over overlooked or what no
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
um so so we DHHS was
 
01:40:11.209 --> 01:40:11.219 align:start position:0%
um we were required to return 22.6
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars in general funds from
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
our Personnel lines and so
 
01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
um I think I've recalled or recounted
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
this story before so last spring I
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
basically sent out a directive to each
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
area within the department and off the
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
top of my head I believe New Hampshire
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
hospital had a three million dollar
 
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
general fund reduction that they needed
 
01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
to hit from their personnel line
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
um and so because of that we don't
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
really have a lot of money to um to
 
01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
so how about a timeline you can't you
 
01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
can't you don't know what the plan is
 
01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
obviously but what what's so when might
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature expect
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
um a solution package and a budgetary
 
01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.250 align:start position:0%
um a solution package and a budgetary
requirement

01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't until we have a plan
 
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
um as as directed by the courts
 
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I I know the doj is involved with
 
01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:14.209 align:start position:0%
um I I know the doj is involved with
that

01:41:14.209 --> 01:41:14.219 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
um as well as the hospitals and I
 
01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
believe they have to come to some kind
 
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
of mutually agree upon proposal and
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
provide that back to the courts before
 
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
we would really have a good sense of
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
what that would cost so until I see that
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
plan I can't really come up with it
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't come up with a
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
good dollar figure for you no I know you
 
01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
can't do dollars I'm just trying to
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
figure out what the timeline is so are
 
01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:34.139 align:start position:0%
we talking about a few months are we
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
talking about a year I guess 29 days
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
from today
 
01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
wow okay
 
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm going to go to page 29
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of homeless services
 
01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of homeless services
and

01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:55.910 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
and try to walk you through this and
 
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
answer your questions we do have the
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
director of economic stability division
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
here Karen Hebert because she's doing a
 
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
a nice warm handoff of this Bureau to
 
01:42:13.609 --> 01:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
our division if there's specific
 
01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
questions that I can't answer so the
 
01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
first slide on this oh go ahead you want
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
to orient yes yes and and if you turn to
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
page 897
 
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
um that that's where the the path Grant
 
01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
the 7926 and on the subsequent page 898
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
the 7927 is the Housing Shelter program
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
and that's another uh thing on Nathan's
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
to-do list
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and the finance team is that we'll
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
get the accounting units um all in one
 
01:42:49.139 --> 01:42:50.149 align:start position:0%
get the accounting units um all in one
place

01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.850 --> 01:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
okay so um these are the three uh
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
Services the programs that are mostly
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
the under the administration of the
 
01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.850 align:start position:0%
the under the administration of the
bureau

01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so we've talked about HUD
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
um this gets really complicated I've
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
heard it about five times and I'm still
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
just getting it
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
um but what there are are there
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
continuums of care within the state of
 
01:43:18.649 --> 01:43:18.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so when you see
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
balance of state that means everything
 
01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
except the Manchester area and the
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
Nashua area those are designated
 
01:43:28.450 --> 01:43:28.460 align:start position:0%
specifically by the federal government
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
and we're responsible for the rest of
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
and again it takes a little while to get
 
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
used to when you see balance of State
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
what does that mean that means that
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
though we cover those areas and we work
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
closely with the other uh to uh
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
continuums of care but are not
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for that
 
01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:55.940 align:start position:0%
so under the projects that are funded
 
01:43:59.330 --> 01:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
are Supportive Housing rapid re-housing
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
and a coordinated entry system
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have a grant that provides
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
those services to homeless and at-risk
 
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.490 align:start position:0%
those services to homeless and at-risk
households

01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
households
 
01:44:17.209 --> 01:44:17.219 align:start position:0%
and in all of these if you look at the
 
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts they're pretty small
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
programs and they're they're small
 
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
amounts that we receive which we can
 
01:44:25.729 --> 01:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
talk about in a little bit
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
Emergency Shelters this is the most
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
visible I think from a public knowledge
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint of what we support
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
um and and I think you're familiar with
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
the shelters and the big ones and that
 
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
and they're not so big ones that we have
 
01:44:44.290 --> 01:44:44.300 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
and some of the challenges that were
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
faced during the pandemic from a social
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
distancing standpoint and now from a
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
capacity standpoint which we we've seen
 
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:00.260 align:start position:0%
most visible in Manchester but it's not
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
um then the um the samsa so this is
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
something that I'm pretty familiar with
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
as the federal Authority Under This they
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
help support the uh projects for
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
assistance in transitioning from
 
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
homeless that's the path Outreach and
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
that is actually funded
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
um to the Community Mental Health
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
Centers so again you can see where some
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
of that natural fit comes in which it's
 
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
the same providers providing
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
the um one thing that again you may be
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with the discussion we had just
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
had this in January the point in time
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
counts this is what we submit to the
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
federal government and it impacts our
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
funding formula and this talks about
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
um where we are on that given day in
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
that particular year and so you'll see
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we we do a really
 
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
um wide
 
01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:08.750 align:start position:0%
um wide
um

01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
Outreach and cast a wide net to make
 
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
sure that we get the best count that we
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
can and so we have those that are in
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
shelters that are counted that's an
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
obvious one we have those who are
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
unsheltered and that's where some of
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
that Outreach those programs are out
 
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
counting and we put those together for
 
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
our total and you can see it goes up and
 
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
down up and down and unfortunately more
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
recently it's gone up
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
so I have some questions here whenever
 
01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:45.659 align:start position:0%
you we whenever there's a shortage of
 
01:46:48.129 --> 01:46:48.139 align:start position:0%
resources there has to be some
 
01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
allocation or prioritization process to
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
to do the best you can with what you've
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
got and so we have many categorical many
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
categories of people who are finding
 
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
themselves homeless that we're trying to
 
01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
provide support for
 
01:47:10.129 --> 01:47:10.139 align:start position:0%
some of them that come to mind
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
are veterans I think there's 125
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
homeless in that category we have
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
refugees we have
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
um you know the people with the
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues we just have all
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
these different categories of potential
 
01:47:26.159 --> 01:47:27.490 align:start position:0%
these different categories of potential
clients

01:47:27.490 --> 01:47:27.500 align:start position:0%
clients
 
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
and um I'm just I'm I'm I'm curious
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
what we do to to try to make sure that
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
there's an equitable and and fair way to
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're prioritizing who
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
gets what how to
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
I mean we
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
my my fear and you can Ally this or is
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
is is that we prefer some categories
 
01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:57.179 align:start position:0%
over others
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I think um in many instances it's our
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
funding source that has us prioritize
 
01:48:07.129 --> 01:48:07.139 align:start position:0%
particular categories so you brought up
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
veterans I believe that that is one
 
01:48:09.239 --> 01:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
veterans I believe that that is one
that's

01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:48:13.129 --> 01:48:13.139 align:start position:0%
um highlighted as a priority
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
um I would probably need to defer to
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
Karen or to our Bureau director who's on
 
01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.229 align:start position:0%
Karen or to our Bureau director who's on
vacation

01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
to get more specifics about how we
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize at the at the shelter level
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
or at the housing level again our
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
funding sources like I like I indicated
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
State opioid response is for individuals
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
who have an opioid use disorder the you
 
01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
need a category potentially of severe
 
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
mental illness to be eligible for
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
particular housing for for that
 
01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
population so it's complicated it's not
 
01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
just necessarily an algorithm that you
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
put in and you get the so this is yet
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
another area where we're getting stove
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
pipe funding things for particular
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
things from the federal government and
 
01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
that we have to manage within those
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
stovepipe boundaries and sometimes it
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
causes us to not be happy with the
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
outcome or the result
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
I would say yes yeah okay and then I'll
 
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and ask my ugly question
 
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
well well Karen comes up and and that is
 
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
um are we are we are are we being forced
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
or are we choosing to
 
01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
um support
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
folks who are in the country illegally
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
prior to satisfying
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Karen Hebert
 
01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
director of the division of economic
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
stability thank you for these questions
 
01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:58.850 align:start position:0%
stability thank you for these questions
um

01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
director Fox was correct and that a lot
 
01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
of our prioritization really is
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
federally driven by what funding the
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development agency is
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
giving opportunities to states to apply
 
01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.270 align:start position:0%
giving opportunities to states to apply
for

01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:18.530 align:start position:0%
for
um

01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
and you're right they do end up stove
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
piping a lot of those categories of
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
individuals whether they're chronically
 
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
homeless which they have a specific
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
definition for whether you have a
 
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
disability uh whether you are
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
um somebody who has AIDS or HIV uh and
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
other people who have other types of
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities that they need or mental
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
health issues that those particular
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
funding streams Provide support for so
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to prioritize them in
 
01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
that particular Realm
 
01:50:56.219 --> 01:50:56.870 align:start position:0%
that particular Realm
um

01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
but this is really what the the balance
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
of State this Continuum of Care is
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
really responsible for where we're
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
trying to work with a number of
 
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
providers in the community a number of
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders where we all come together
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
and try to determine really what are the
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
resources that we have available to make
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we are addressing each one of
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
those categories as best as we can
 
01:51:21.239 --> 01:51:23.390 align:start position:0%
those categories as best as we can
together

01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
I've already forgotten your second
 
01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:27.890 align:start position:0%
I've already forgotten your second
question

01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:30.020 align:start position:0%
it's really smart to forget that one
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's that that's the ugly one about uh
 
01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
folks who are in the state who are in
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
our nation illegally are we are we being
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
required to meet their needs for housing
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
before or the needs of New Hampshire
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
citizens are met not necessarily I think
 
01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:50.780 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these things happen
 
01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and depends on a number
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
of factors such as the volume of
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
individuals who need various types of
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
services so we have funding that we do
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
receive from the federal government
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for refugees
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that is just we all know refugees
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
are here legally I'm I'm making the the
 
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:15.179 align:start position:0%
explicit distinction about the uninvited
 
01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
guests who come across the border uh
 
01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:21.050 align:start position:0%
guests who come across the border uh
illegally

01:52:21.050 --> 01:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
because we have a flood of them in the
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
nation and then just recently Governor
 
01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
sununu has pointed out that we now have
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
an influx coming from Canada so some
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
those folks are going somewhere those
 
01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
folks need to live somewhere I'm just
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
curious about the crowding out effect
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
of of our Pro on our programs because
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
this this may be actually a huge budget
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
requirement that we're not seeing if
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
we're only looking at funding programs
 
01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:55.580 align:start position:0%
for these accepted categories
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
do you follow me
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
I do and I don't believe there's a
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
simple answer to your question right or
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
your concerned I think it's a it's
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
probably bigger than right uh I like
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
your big questions yes you do
 
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
um you know I can certainly provide
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
information about the number of
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
individuals who we are serving currently
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
through the refugee program I can't tell
 
01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
you the number of them that are illegal
 
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
versus legal but I can try to look into
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
that information and talk show my
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
mistake and I thought Refugee was a word
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
for those invited you know like the
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
people from Afghanistan the people from
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh Ukraine you know we we've we've
 
01:53:42.169 --> 01:53:42.179 align:start position:0%
invited particular people to come to our
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
nation as refugees
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
does that term include those that we've
 
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
not explicitly invited I'm not sure that
 
01:53:53.209 --> 01:53:53.219 align:start position:0%
I would use the word invited there is
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
looking for a polite word to say this
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
because there's an extensive process
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the U.S Department of State
 
01:54:03.129 --> 01:54:03.139 align:start position:0%
conducts when accepting or not
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be who would come
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the United States as a refugee
 
01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:11.219 align:start position:0%
there's significant screening uh this
 
01:54:14.090 --> 01:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
takes weeks to conduct before they are
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
before they enter into the United States
 
01:54:19.729 --> 01:54:19.739 align:start position:0%
services in any of those states have to
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
be coordinated and agreed upon
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
wherever the destination may be so we
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
have services available in New Hampshire
 
01:54:32.770 --> 01:54:32.780 align:start position:0%
that do provide act as that point
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
organization if you will for those
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
particular individuals to then provide
 
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
them with appropriate or necessary
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
Community Services which are very
 
01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.570 align:start position:0%
Community Services which are very
temporary

01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:45.530 align:start position:0%
temporary
um

01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
so again I can't give you a specific
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
answer on the number of individuals who
 
01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:53.270 align:start position:0%
answer on the number of individuals who
um

01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
come here to to the state I can tell you
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
that I can get you a number of the
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
individuals we have provided Refugee
 
01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
services to all right and just to come
 
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
back to why I'm asking these questions
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
is because we have pre-established needs
 
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
for these programs and we have a new
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
surge of people who can be showing up in
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:55:20.890 --> 01:55:20.900 align:start position:0%
placing demands on an already scarce
 
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
resource right and I'm just curious what
 
01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
the impact of that's going to be in
 
01:55:28.609 --> 01:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
terms of us trying to if we wanted as a
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
policy issue just support those folks or
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
what the budget impact might be and what
 
01:55:38.209 --> 01:55:38.219 align:start position:0%
the policy issue might be if we want to
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
continue to prioritize New Hampshire
 
01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:44.149 align:start position:0%
continue to prioritize New Hampshire
citizens

01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.159 --> 01:55:45.530 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
so so so we can we can come off of this
 
01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
and have this discussion later but but
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
uh representative hole and then I think
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'm not sure who
 
01:55:58.370 --> 01:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
the right person is to address the
 
01:56:00.169 --> 01:56:00.179 align:start position:0%
question to
 
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
um I spent a year working in a
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
non-profit drug and alcohol rehab during
 
01:56:07.129 --> 01:56:07.139 align:start position:0%
that time I learned a lot about
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
um mental health and and addictions and
 
01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
how to treat it I also found out that
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
you can only help people who want to be
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
helped at the bottom line you can't
 
01:56:19.129 --> 01:56:19.139 align:start position:0%
force someone to want to get help
 
01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work you spend you can spend
 
01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
all the money and time in the world if
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
they don't want to get better they can't
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
so the question is is what is in the
 
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
current program to help filter out to
 
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
focus the resources on those who want to
 
01:56:38.810 --> 01:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
in the context of your question I think
 
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
director Fox would probably be best to
 
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:47.090 align:start position:0%
director Fox would probably be best to
answer

01:56:47.090 --> 01:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:54.649 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:56:54.649 --> 01:56:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.689 --> 01:56:56.699 align:start position:0%
so we have a hot potato going back and
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
forth between the two of us so be happy
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
to try to address that I agree I
 
01:57:01.199 --> 01:57:02.209 align:start position:0%
to try to address that I agree I
understand

01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
um especially with your experience where
 
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
you're coming from
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
um what I think it's incumbent upon all
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
of us is to offer the opportunity and
 
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:13.430 align:start position:0%
of us is to offer the opportunity and
perhaps

01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
um more than once but that we don't
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
expect there's no mandate there's no
 
01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
expectation that someone has to be in a
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
particular program so we offer the
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity we leave doors open but we
 
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.669 align:start position:0%
opportunity we leave doors open but we
don't

01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:57:32.169 --> 01:57:32.179 align:start position:0%
um we don't interfere with someone's
 
01:57:34.729 --> 01:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
right to be able to
 
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
not engage right but is there
 
01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a point right I agree
 
01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
leaving the door open right you want to
 
01:57:44.689 --> 01:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
make sure the help is available but
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
there is a point where someone is
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
choosing not to take advantage of that
 
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
and continuing to make sure those
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
resources are available to that person
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
versus someone who is saying hey I want
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
to get better I want to I I want I want
 
01:57:59.089 --> 01:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
to overcome this I want to change my
 
01:57:59.099 --> 01:58:00.229 align:start position:0%
to overcome this I want to change my
lifestyle

01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
lifestyle
 
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
is there anything we can do to help
 
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
focus on those who want to get ahead
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
because there's a huge return putting
 
01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
those people back into society's
 
01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
productive citizens
 
01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:12.659 align:start position:0%
so I think that we already unfortunately
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
do that we prioritize by the fact that
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have limited resources and so for
 
01:58:21.129 --> 01:58:21.139 align:start position:0%
those who who do want to engage we do
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
provide those services for those who
 
01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
don't we we just don't have the
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to expend as much on trying
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
to convince them on in our ways you know
 
01:58:35.149 --> 01:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
that like so I think it's a balance I
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
think that some people reach a point
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
much later than we would want them to
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
reach that so that that door is open
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
when they are willing and able to take
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of services
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I think this is relevant to this
 
01:58:53.810 --> 01:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
dialogue here but a few years ago I was
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
on the board of a transitional housing
 
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
charity and uh one of the issues that
 
01:59:03.290 --> 01:59:03.300 align:start position:0%
confronted that transitional housing
 
01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
organization is that the federal
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
government had something I think it was
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
called housing first and so if you
 
01:59:16.089 --> 01:59:16.099 align:start position:0%
brought somebody into your uh
 
01:59:20.209 --> 01:59:20.219 align:start position:0%
congregate housing situation and and one
 
01:59:23.930 --> 01:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
of them continued to abuse drugs even
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
Supply drugs in some instances that they
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
had to remain in the congregate living
 
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
situation without the ability of the
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
organization to remove them because that
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
Federal housing first program
 
01:59:39.119 --> 01:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
Federal housing first program
um

01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
organizations that chose not to accept
 
01:59:45.410 --> 01:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
the housing first program were
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited from getting any federal
 
01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:48.530 align:start position:0%
prohibited from getting any federal
money

01:59:48.530 --> 01:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:59:51.649 --> 01:59:51.659 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm kind of curious to
 
01:59:53.890 --> 01:59:53.900 align:start position:0%
representative holes in general question
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
is to what extent is the federal housing
 
01:59:58.080 --> 01:59:59.589 align:start position:0%
is to what extent is the federal housing
first

01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
requirements still in effect is it
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
causing us issues with being selective
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
and prioritizing people who really want
 
02:00:07.679 --> 02:00:08.770 align:start position:0%
and prioritizing people who really want
help

02:00:08.770 --> 02:00:08.780 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
is it tying our hands or is there a
 
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
waiver that we ought to be asking for
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
any of those things
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those areas where I am
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
going to plead ignorance and say that
 
02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
I'll have to get back to you with a
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
response to that since I do know that a
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
housing first exists but I don't know
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
the details of the requirements
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
when that model is employed so I'm going
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
to have to get back to you on that
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's very fair representative walner
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you in the area of
 
02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:42.890 align:start position:0%
yes thank you in the area of
homelessness

02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:43.490 align:start position:0%
homelessness
um

02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
what are
 
02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
are there I'm sure there are many gaps
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
in the services that we provide
 
02:00:54.109 --> 02:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
and the need
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I wondered is was there a
 
02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
prioritized need a request that was not
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
funded in this budget
 
02:01:03.119 --> 02:01:04.729 align:start position:0%
funded in this budget
yes

02:01:04.729 --> 02:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so we have our shelter programs that
 
02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
currently receive eight dollars a day
 
02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
per bed you know per um utilization and
 
02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
we had uh proposed to increase that to
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars and to expand capacity
 
02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:25.739 align:start position:0%
um by not a great amount but by a little
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
bit and that was to the tune of 10
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the shelter programs
 
02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
and an additional so it was a an
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
additional 2 million for some of those
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
Support Services
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
um for those individuals in
 
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
stabilization so yes we had uh 12
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars in a prioritized need
 
02:01:48.970 --> 02:01:48.980 align:start position:0%
request each each of the fiscal years
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
and there currently is a bill in the
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
Senate that would provide the majority
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
of that funding
 
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
so so this question has been asked a few
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
times and every time it gets asked I
 
02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:11.219 align:start position:0%
mean just to request if it hasn't
 
02:02:13.810 --> 02:02:13.820 align:start position:0%
already been provided sort of a
 
02:02:16.609 --> 02:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
Consolidated list of all the prioritized
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
needs that didn't get satisfied by the
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
governor as far as I know we already
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
have that from you and I just don't know
 
02:02:24.850 --> 02:02:24.860 align:start position:0%
where it is
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
so so I've been accumulating a list of
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
change requests and then prioritize
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
needs from each discussion my plan was
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
once we finish all the presentations to
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
provide that listing to you unless you'd
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
like it piecemeal
 
02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know how I want it I just know
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we're going to end up getting
 
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
feeling like we're crushed for time and
 
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
as soon as we get uh hb2 over to us I'm
 
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
probably going to ask Mr Ripple and uh
 
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren to help me
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
figure out how we could begin to vote on
 
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
some of the components of the budget to
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
kind of move them along and get them out
 
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
of the way and I don't know that we
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
could do that without good visibility on
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs yeah so I I was
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
planning a high level summary document
 
02:03:16.729 --> 02:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
that would have the individual change
 
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
requests the prioritized needs and then
 
02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:22.139 align:start position:0%
a separate I Was preparing a layman's
 
02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
term document for the hb2 provisions to
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
try to translate sometimes it's the
 
02:03:28.609 --> 02:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
language that's included in hb2 is not
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
intuitive whatsoever to provide that to
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
the committee as well so that when you
 
02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
look at the hb2 provision and it's
 
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
citing some chapter law from three years
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
ago there's an explanation behind that
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
so it's clear to the committee what that
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
is to help you move forward with your
 
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
votes okay I don't I don't want to ask
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
you to do a thrashing exercise where
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're constantly updating it because
 
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
we'll just lose track of it anyways and
 
02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
it's not worth the overhead okay so so
 
02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
just know that I'm really glad you're
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to provide that because I think we
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
have real utility for it and or it has
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
really utility and sooner is better than
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
later obviously
 
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
do you understand what I'm saying
 
02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:10.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:12.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
right but the other part I want to just
 
02:04:17.209 --> 02:04:17.219 align:start position:0%
check with you on is is what I'm hoping
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
to do is when we get our hb2 and uh and
 
02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
we've got several of these uh budgets
 
02:04:28.609 --> 02:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
that we've gone over that we uh start
 
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
our voting early to remove the things
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we all agree on uh the the the the
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
low-hanging fruit within the budget so
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
that we can narrow our Focus where there
 
02:04:42.169 --> 02:04:42.179 align:start position:0%
might be a little more controversy yeah
 
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
so I'll be coming to you in a week or
 
02:04:49.689 --> 02:04:49.699 align:start position:0%
two asking where where we can begin to
 
02:04:52.850 --> 02:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
prioritize early voting yes
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
and then you're obviously the key player
 
02:04:56.209 --> 02:04:56.219 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.970 --> 02:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
is there additional
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
I think we're down to a page or two yeah
 
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming that when we hit the
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
end of the colored coloring book that
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're done with you right
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
so um we I think we're on 31 is that
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes we're on 31. so this um
 
02:05:28.510 --> 02:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
goes into more detail about the
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
um and how that's designed at the
 
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
continued of care brings together a
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
bunch of individuals at a community
 
02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
level so there may be a lead but it's
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
really Community Driven and planned so
 
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
that there's improved coordination and
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
integration and identifying those
 
02:05:53.810 --> 02:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs as we go through not
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the same way that we use them here at
 
02:05:59.570 --> 02:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
the finance table
 
02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and then the funding as I said that
 
02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot of dollars when you look
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
at the amount of need and actually the
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.290 --> 02:06:20.300 align:start position:0%
page 32 again just a geographic
 
02:06:23.930 --> 02:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
distribution and depiction of how that
 
02:06:28.010 --> 02:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.530 --> 02:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at your map and around
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
Nashua it's it's it's a darker color yes
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
what does
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
it says is that just to indicate that
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's the greater Nashua area and yeah
 
02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
and why why do we care about Nashua and
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester is that because that's where
 
02:06:49.609 --> 02:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
the federal programs are yes yes so when
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government through
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
um HUD makes those Awards there are
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
three designated uh continuums of care
 
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
and that is a direct
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
um relationship between Manchester and
 
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
greater Nashua with HUD and then we have
 
02:07:09.169 --> 02:07:09.179 align:start position:0%
the direct relationship with the balance
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then the key accomplishments
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
um there's a good list there
 
02:07:22.669 --> 02:07:22.679 align:start position:0%
um there has been the coordinated entry
 
02:07:22.679 --> 02:07:23.930 align:start position:0%
um there has been the coordinated entry
process

02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so that there is an opportunity to
 
02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.790 align:start position:0%
um so that there is an opportunity to
see

02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
um when someone comes in there's that
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
assessment that's done and standardize
 
02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
the way that people are assessed and
 
02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:38.030 align:start position:0%
the way that people are assessed and
referred

02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
referred
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and then the other accomplishments
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
include the grants anytime we receive a
 
02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:46.820 align:start position:0%
grant that's above and beyond the
 
02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
traditional funding that we've had is a
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
victory and a reason to celebrate so
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
we've had rapid re-housing for
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
individuals talking about prioritized
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
needs and prioritized populations so
 
02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
survivors of domestic violence and human
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
trafficking so those two projects
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
and then let me ask you about the human
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
trafficking part of this yep the other
 
02:08:14.689 --> 02:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
day we we heard that there were about 12
 
02:08:16.970 --> 02:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
people that we had identified in the
 
02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
previous calendar year as being victims
 
02:08:22.609 --> 02:08:22.619 align:start position:0%
of of trafficking that they tended to be
 
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire people and they all
 
02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
seem to be correlated heavily with uh
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
with drug use probably to keep the
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
person from being competent enough to
 
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
leave on their own but so so what are
 
02:08:40.729 --> 02:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
what are we doing in the in a human
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
trafficking area if they're we're
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
talking about 12 people
 
02:08:47.089 --> 02:08:47.099 align:start position:0%
so that was 12 identified in that
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
particular year there are others that
 
02:08:53.209 --> 02:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
have been identified previous to so it's
 
02:08:56.689 --> 02:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
a cumulative you know what I mean so we
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
had 12 that were identified in that
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year human trafficking I'm not
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
sure what part of our department
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
addresses that and works most closely on
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
that this program was just awarded so it
 
02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:16.139 align:start position:0%
has yet to um to be implemented
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay but I assume that they it's
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
transitional also that it's it's not
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
meant to
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
keep keep them perpetually dependent on
 
02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
the state correct all right
 
02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:31.370 align:start position:0%
the state correct all right
representative

02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
there are a number of non-profit
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
groups kind of sex trafficking survivors
 
02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking within the state
 
02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:44.030 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking within the state
um

02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
some of whom are on the speaking circuit
 
02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
some of whom are available for
 
02:09:50.450 --> 02:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
consultation I think the numbers are
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the number is far greater
 
02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
than 12 in the state that's where the
 
02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
problem is have you guys consulted with
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
them to to work with where where they
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
either the touch points are here's where
 
02:10:04.729 --> 02:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
the person is is most likely to be
 
02:10:06.609 --> 02:10:06.619 align:start position:0%
receptive to help
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
or here's the here's the underlying
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances or the um
 
02:10:17.689 --> 02:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
The Good the indicators that are really
 
02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
if you spot this this is also going on
 
02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
type thing
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to broadcast I'm not
 
02:10:24.410 --> 02:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
going to ask that question but the key
 
02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
indicators that's probably the better
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
term right
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
and and and talked with those that are
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
coming unfortunately out of this
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
horrific lifestyle
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
so I know that the Attorney General's
 
02:10:38.570 --> 02:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
office has played a prominent role in
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue not just in the
 
02:10:43.609 --> 02:10:43.619 align:start position:0%
prosecution but also in the programming
 
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
for those individuals so and there may
 
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
be areas of our department that I am not
 
02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
aware of that are working specifically
 
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
on this issue so again it's one of those
 
02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.229 --> 02:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
um Karen was just
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
um saying that when we have the balance
 
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
estate when I said we bring together all
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
those groups and representatives there
 
02:11:13.129 --> 02:11:13.139 align:start position:0%
are representatives from this particular
 
02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
population and Advocates um people who
 
02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.689 --> 02:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
and just the last point that I'll make
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that housing and this issue crosses a
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
lot of departments in the state as I
 
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned before we have the Community
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
Development Finance Authority New
 
02:11:37.129 --> 02:11:37.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority and
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
others who all serve on the um the
 
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
Council on housing stability and that is
 
02:11:50.109 --> 02:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
a very representative group of counties
 
02:11:50.119 --> 02:11:51.850 align:start position:0%
a very representative group of counties
providers

02:11:51.850 --> 02:11:51.860 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:11:55.930 --> 02:11:55.940 align:start position:0%
and state Personnel who serve on that
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we have recommendations can get the
 
02:12:02.169 --> 02:12:02.179 align:start position:0%
report to you if if you haven't seen it
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
our associate commissioner Chris
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
Antonello is one of the co-chairs of
 
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
that and can provide we can provide more
 
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
information on that but that's really
 
02:12:14.169 --> 02:12:14.179 align:start position:0%
where we come together and try to solve
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
the the issues and some of the
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
legislation that you've seen in the past
 
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
couple years has been a direct result of
 
02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
I am done you know um it's not in here
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
but I would just you know my one of my
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
takeaways on one of your your key
 
02:12:37.970 --> 02:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
challenges is you have
 
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
um there are so many social determinants
 
02:12:41.089 --> 02:12:41.099 align:start position:0%
of care
 
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
there are so many organizations involved
 
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
there are so many Community Resources
 
02:12:48.890 --> 02:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:12:52.569 --> 02:12:52.579 align:start position:0%
that there's not an information system
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
to create a common uh view of the
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
situation and what and who's doing what
 
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
and where and so to me it feels like you
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
have like a tremendous coordination
 
02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.129 align:start position:0%
have like a tremendous coordination
challenge

02:13:09.129 --> 02:13:09.139 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
without any tools to support efficient
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
Communications and coordination and and
 
02:13:16.079 --> 02:13:17.149 align:start position:0%
Communications and coordination and and
so

02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how you do it I don't
 
02:13:21.169 --> 02:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
know how you do it without just like
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
pulling your hair out to try to keep
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
track of all the moving Parts in that
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
thing so so I I don't know if I've heard
 
02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
something you've not brought into the
 
02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
record but that would be one of my
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
concerns is how do we how do we give you
 
02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
the tools to make that job easier or do
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
02:13:42.649 --> 02:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think you've raised the point
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we have multiple tools but they
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily all coordinate
 
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
um together so we we do have
 
02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
um a homeless management information
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
system that is for is for specifically
 
02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:56.990 align:start position:0%
system that is for is for specifically
for

02:13:56.990 --> 02:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
um this this Bureau but then we have
 
02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
other systems across the board so yeah
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's something that we want to bring in
 
02:14:06.530 --> 02:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I think you've heard Dave Wieters
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
talk about those efforts
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
um and I think um you heard Trish Tilly
 
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about that bringing
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
that data together and information
 
02:14:18.649 --> 02:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
together and it's something that if we
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
had one solution it would be great but I
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
think that it's a system all of those
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
systems have been built in their legacy
 
02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
systems and then there's the Homegrown
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
and there's the
 
02:14:34.129 --> 02:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
um the different programs and Excel
 
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
sheets and all of that and and yeah it's
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
something we have worked on and we
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate your interest because it's
 
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
helped Propel us to be able to focus on
 
02:14:56.209 --> 02:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up to our discussions
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday Mr White has done a great job
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
going through and very knowledgeable I
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
guess at some point
 
02:15:06.530 --> 02:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
will he be available to do kind of a
 
02:15:08.689 --> 02:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
line by line Page by Page to go through
 
02:15:11.629 --> 02:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
the 100 plus pages of the budget can we
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
schedule that I mean at the at the hb1
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
level just because there's a bunch of
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
questions that are in the nitty-gritty
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of funding accounts and
 
02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
as a new member of the committee there's
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
a bunch of background information I
 
02:15:28.189 --> 02:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
don't have but Mr White might have
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
so let me say this about that
 
02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:31.430 align:start position:0%
so let me say this about that
um

02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
we we have a Time budget uh you have an
 
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
information requirement one of the ways
 
02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
I was hoping to create space for that
 
02:15:43.609 --> 02:15:43.619 align:start position:0%
was to work with uh representative
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
nordgren and you all to identify where
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
we can move issues off of our plate
 
02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
sooner so that we can narrow our focus
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that we have ongoing
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
questions I I think I think we still
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
have what uh Mr Ripple about 10 days
 
02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
that we've reserved for work sessions
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
that are not yet programmed for activity
 
02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:10.850 align:start position:0%
that are not yet programmed for activity
foreign

02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's true I'm hoping you can get
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
through all the presentations by the end
 
02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
of next week I'm not sure if that'll be
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
possible there may be a straggler that
 
02:16:19.490 --> 02:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
goes into the week after but you will
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
have about a week and a half uh in which
 
02:16:23.689 --> 02:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
to make decisions
 
02:16:26.209 --> 02:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
so so thank you so one of the things
 
02:16:28.490 --> 02:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Mooney has been
 
02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
doing is she's been pinging you everyone
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
to say okay we just heard about this
 
02:16:35.929 --> 02:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
what are your questions what are your
 
02:16:39.530 --> 02:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
issues and I I would hope to the extent
 
02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
that you've gone through these and you
 
02:16:44.089 --> 02:16:44.099 align:start position:0%
go oh look here's here's several areas
 
02:16:46.370 --> 02:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
that I don't think I have enough data
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
that you're sending that to her so that
 
02:16:52.009 --> 02:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
we have some mapping of what your your
 
02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
any other comments for our guests I'll
 
02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
go out to the audience and say is there
 
02:17:04.730 --> 02:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
anyone who came here wanting to say
 
02:17:06.830 --> 02:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
something or has been triggered to want
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
to say something that would like to say
 
02:17:08.519 --> 02:17:10.910 align:start position:0%
to say something that would like to say
something

02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
seeing any motion
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead come on up
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
yeah come to the microphone because
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:22.009 --> 02:17:22.019 align:start position:0%
and then you'll want to read the name so
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stringham knows you if
 
02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
you've got a business card that's even
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
um Jim Monahan with the DuPont group um
 
02:17:33.049 --> 02:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
and we did
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
um uh we do have two representatives in
 
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
the community community mental health
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
centers here today uh that we're hoping
 
02:17:42.770 --> 02:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
to explain uh to the committee the memo
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
that we had sent you previously with
 
02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
regard to a wage Gap and housing issues
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
okay so I now I just need to figure out
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
how much time they need and whether or
 
02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
not we should take a short break for
 
02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.139 align:start position:0%
lunch or just uh drive through so what
 
02:18:00.650 --> 02:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
what kind of time do you think we we
 
02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:02.230 align:start position:0%
what kind of time do you think we we
need

02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
for the the
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
time 10 minutes maybe 10 minutes yeah
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone object to us going to 12 30
 
02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
and and trying to wrap up
 
02:18:28.730 --> 02:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:30.129 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:18:30.129 --> 02:18:30.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
and the same thing if you all have
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
business cards to drop off we'll we'll
 
02:19:09.770 --> 02:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm gonna let um Maggie perch it
 
02:19:14.089 --> 02:19:14.099 align:start position:0%
in and Jonathan with your introduce
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
themselves some rolled safe play but
 
02:19:17.570 --> 02:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
just to orient the committee the
 
02:19:20.209 --> 02:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
information provided to you includes a
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
fancy annual report which details the
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
work of the Community Mental Health
 
02:19:25.730 --> 02:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
Centers but more specifically there's a
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
budget memo
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
um included in there which addresses
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
issues with regard to vacancies at the
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers and then
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
offers uh perspective on the workforce
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
challenges that that we're facing as
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
well as touches on some specific needs
 
02:19:48.049 --> 02:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
and requests with regard to housing for
 
02:19:49.969 --> 02:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
the mental health community so I'm going
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
to hand it off I guess to
 
02:19:55.870 --> 02:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.330 --> 02:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
I promise I'll talk very fast
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
um my name is Maggie Pritchard I'm the
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
CEO for the Lakes Region Mental Health
 
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
Center which covers Plymouth and some of
 
02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
Grafton County
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
um and I worked 40 years in Community
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health starting in Manchester
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
Nashua Dover I've been around with the
 
02:20:16.969 --> 02:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
block a couple of times right now I
 
02:20:18.349 --> 02:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
serve as the president of the community
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Association and the
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
reason we're here today is because the
 
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates are determined by you
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
right to some extent and so I can't say
 
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
like Walmart I want to raise the price
 
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
of my pencil so that I can pay my
 
02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
employees more right or because my
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
health insurance cost went up I'm
 
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
beholden to the system because we serve
 
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
at the Community Mental Health Center
 
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable and the poorest
 
02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state and so therefore
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
when the Medicaid rates don't change or
 
02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
don't keep time with the cost of living
 
02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
and other things our employees start to
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
fade away and go away and we lose them
 
02:20:58.910 --> 02:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
and they don't come back because they
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
take jobs that pay more and we're trying
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
to fix this Workforce issue from a
 
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
number of areas from student loan
 
02:21:09.469 --> 02:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
repayment programs to internships You
 
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
Name It We Do It retention bonuses
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
sign-on bonuses although we can't
 
02:21:15.650 --> 02:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
compete with some of the for-profit
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
agencies that offer sign-on bonuses so
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
right now we're coming to you because we
 
02:21:23.570 --> 02:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
believe that our Workforce is in
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
desperate need
 
02:21:26.929 --> 02:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
so so miss Pritchard thank you for
 
02:21:26.939 --> 02:21:27.950 align:start position:0%
so so miss Pritchard thank you for
coming

02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I I want to I want to give you some
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
context in case you hadn't heard from
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
our other hearings on this subject where
 
02:21:39.889 --> 02:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
I think we're at as a as a Division I I
 
02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
think we're where we're at and then if
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
if you all want to correct me but uh
 
02:21:47.090 --> 02:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take that but where I think
 
02:21:49.969 --> 02:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
we're at is that
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
um in the governor's budget proposal
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
with the 3.1 percent across the board
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate he invited us to take a
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
more targeted approach uh in previous
 
02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:03.730 align:start position:0%
more targeted approach uh in previous
years

02:22:03.730 --> 02:22:03.740 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
advocates for a particular segment of
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
our health care System have had some
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
success at coming in individually ass
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
justifying a particular increase in
 
02:22:19.550 --> 02:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
their area for which we've put a
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid on a lot of those
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
we've gone long enough that when talking
 
02:22:28.210 --> 02:22:28.220 align:start position:0%
to Mr lippman
 
02:22:32.530 --> 02:22:32.540 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the time has has come
 
02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
where we need as sort of a an entire
 
02:22:40.370 --> 02:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
fresh look at rate setting across the
 
02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:41.210 align:start position:0%
fresh look at rate setting across the
board

02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
and in an Ideal World
 
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
your particular request would be in the
 
02:22:51.010 --> 02:22:51.020 align:start position:0%
context of a big picture
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
assessment of where we are on rates
 
02:22:58.010 --> 02:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
across the Medicaid Spectrum okay but
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's not a perfect world that rate
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
setting process
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
is going to take at best six months
 
02:23:08.809 --> 02:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
probably you know more like a year I'm
 
02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
kind of hoping that it'll get done
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
before the next budget process starts
 
02:23:16.250 --> 02:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know to be frank with you but um but
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
so what I also what we've also said to
 
02:23:23.330 --> 02:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman is look that's a long time and
 
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
there are things that are getting ready
 
02:23:29.929 --> 02:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
to break that we don't want broken so so
 
02:23:32.650 --> 02:23:32.660 align:start position:0%
so reach in
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
to the rate setting problem and help us
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
identify those areas where there's the
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
most critical need so that we can we can
 
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
slap another Band-Aid or two potentially
 
02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's a sub-optimal way for
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
us to do our job right and so so you're
 
02:23:55.070 --> 02:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
here with a valid request I'm absolutely
 
02:23:57.309 --> 02:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
convinced that you are
 
02:23:59.809 --> 02:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
that my Challenge and maybe the
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
challenge that's shared by the other
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
members is how do we look at your very
 
02:24:07.929 --> 02:24:07.939 align:start position:0%
valid request
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
in isolation given that we know that we
 
02:24:14.270 --> 02:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
have probably a much bigger structural
 
02:24:18.050 --> 02:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
deficit over years of sort of neglect in
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid reimbursement rates and and
 
02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:21.969 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid reimbursement rates and and
and

02:24:21.969 --> 02:24:21.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
so I just want to share that with you so
 
02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
that as you continue to speak to us that
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you could help us walk through
 
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
what I think we need to also be hearing
 
02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:33.530 align:start position:0%
what I think we need to also be hearing
is

02:24:33.530 --> 02:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
um what what what is the case for
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
looking at your area in isolation of the
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
bigger problem uh is there something on
 
02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
the verge of collapse or breaking that
 
02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
is would be hard to restore I mean we're
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
sort of in a crisis management moment
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
here can can you help us yeah so I would
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
say the biggest issue or the biggest
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
problem is that not putting at least a
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid on Mental Health means that you
 
02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
will see expense in other places right
 
02:25:08.210 --> 02:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
so when I have 50 people lined up at the
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
door who want treatment and as
 
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
representative house said you got to
 
02:25:13.849 --> 02:25:13.859 align:start position:0%
work with people when they want and when
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
they can change I can't take them in the
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
door because I don't have any staff to
 
02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
treat them right and so what happens is
 
02:25:25.490 --> 02:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
people become more ill it's sort of like
 
02:25:27.469 --> 02:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
if you can't get a haircut and your hair
 
02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
gets out of control you're going to be
 
02:25:30.410 --> 02:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
out of control until you get a haircut
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
and what happens with mental illness is
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
you don't treat them you have people
 
02:25:37.010 --> 02:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
stand in line you make them wait they
 
02:25:39.469 --> 02:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
don't get better there's not a way to
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
get better and so as somebody who's
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for the financial stability
 
02:25:48.410 --> 02:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
of our state I would say that investing
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
in something that's going to save you
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
money and save people's lives is is a
 
02:25:55.070 --> 02:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
good thing right but I'm not going to
 
02:25:56.929 --> 02:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
tell you that children and old people
 
02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
who need In-Home Care are any less
 
02:26:01.130 --> 02:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
worthy of those dollars and those
 
02:26:03.170 --> 02:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funds I can't I can't sit here
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
and do that that wouldn't be fair right
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
I can just tell you that running a
 
02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
mental health center and working in one
 
02:26:11.570 --> 02:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
for the last 40 years that I can't get
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
people to come and work for me and that
 
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
makes me very anxious about what's at
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
risk in my community who's at risk right
 
02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
I have 22 vacancies right now 21 of them
 
02:26:25.130 --> 02:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
are for bachelor's level and Master's
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
level clinicians
 
02:26:28.969 --> 02:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:26:28.979 --> 02:26:29.570 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

02:26:29.570 --> 02:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
so right now the Urgent issue that we
 
02:26:34.969 --> 02:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
have is this court order where we have
 
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
people who are warehoused and it's
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
people who like that term but I think it
 
02:26:42.170 --> 02:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
works is that we were warehousing people
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
in emergency rooms because we don't have
 
02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
room in the New Hampshire hospital
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
because there's no place in the
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
communities to move them
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
so your
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
a catcher's mitt are you not your
 
02:26:59.450 --> 02:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
facility receives would be open to being
 
02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:00.790 align:start position:0%
facility receives would be open to being
a

02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:27:03.770 --> 02:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
receiver of patients at the New
 
02:27:05.929 --> 02:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to help us move
 
02:27:08.690 --> 02:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
people out of there if you had more
 
02:27:10.849 --> 02:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
capacity is that is that accurate that's
 
02:27:13.730 --> 02:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
absolutely true so I I don't mean to
 
02:27:15.889 --> 02:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
boil it down or minimize it I'm just
 
02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the workflow and
 
02:27:19.969 --> 02:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
exactly where you fit in and what
 
02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
problem we're trying to solve
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
right and when you think about someone
 
02:27:25.969 --> 02:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
who's inpatient versus someone who's in
 
02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
community and I'm charged essentially
 
02:27:31.490 --> 02:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
with prioritizing should I get someone
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
out because I got to get someone in and
 
02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
how do I do that balance and and
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
something has to give in the system we
 
02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have written this we wouldn't
 
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
have gotten on top of it with all of you
 
02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
and having met with some of you
 
02:27:47.809 --> 02:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
previously just to say this is really a
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
crisis right now if you don't fix this
 
02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
you also have other expenses down the
 
02:27:55.969 --> 02:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
road that you don't want to pay for
 
02:27:59.090 --> 02:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
um and so we wanted to make a plea in
 
02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
particular for mental health not because
 
02:28:02.690 --> 02:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
they're more deserving of anyone else
 
02:28:07.130 --> 02:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
but because our system is in a crisis
 
02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
Jonathan did you want to see it he runs
 
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record on Jonathan
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
ruthier Executive Vice President for the
 
02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
mental health center of Greater
 
02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester and if that's a twist for
 
02:28:20.170 --> 02:28:20.180 align:start position:0%
some of you you've seen me here
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
presenting on behalf of the
 
02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
developmental disability system in my
 
02:28:26.570 --> 02:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
prior role at cs9 but I joined the
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
mental health center of Greater
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester a little over a year ago
 
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
because most of my career has been in
 
02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
mental health and I really I felt uh
 
02:28:37.309 --> 02:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
that our our growing problem in being
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
able to serve people required people who
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
had experience to come back to the fold
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
so in addition to my role as a Executive
 
02:28:44.929 --> 02:28:44.939 align:start position:0%
Vice President and I'm also in the
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
preparation process to start providing
 
02:28:48.770 --> 02:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
Services again where I'm able to and
 
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
given the the confines of my schedule
 
02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
um just for context we're you know we
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
are the largest Mental Health Center in
 
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:28:59.570 --> 02:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
we serve about 12 000 people a year and
 
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
I have 500 families who can't get served
 
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
right now uh because of our our lack of
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
clinicians and that's just in our
 
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
children's Department we have a total of
 
02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
71 open positions 68 of those are
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
clinical positions and um you know at
 
02:29:16.849 --> 02:29:16.859 align:start position:0%
least uh
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
a third of those are our master's level
 
02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:21.410 align:start position:0%
a third of those are our master's level
clinicians

02:29:21.410 --> 02:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
clinicians
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
our rapid response team you've heard a
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
lot about rapid response we have a 55
 
02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate there so we rely on people
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing overtime and filling in extra
 
02:29:34.849 --> 02:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
shifts from other departments
 
02:29:36.889 --> 02:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
and that's great it's a great
 
02:29:38.270 --> 02:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to learn that
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
with those skills and it's a great
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to chip in and it
 
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
has a shelf life people get tired and
 
02:29:49.610 --> 02:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
we've our our staff surveys tell us how
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
tired people are they're exhausted
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
they're exhausted for paperwork they're
 
02:29:56.090 --> 02:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
exhausted from uh you know working too
 
02:29:58.130 --> 02:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
long and having to chip in all over the
 
02:30:00.650 --> 02:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
place to cover holes I greatly
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your awareness and attention
 
02:30:05.389 --> 02:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
to this any of us I think would be happy
 
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
to answer questions now or or outside of
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee session to help inform your
 
02:30:12.170 --> 02:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
decision making on this
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.969 --> 02:30:21.979 align:start position:0%
um just a comment I think
 
02:30:25.090 --> 02:30:25.100 align:start position:0%
one of the issues obviously that's
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
impacted mental health but it all those
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
services medical hospitals whatever has
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
been the pandemic and people who are
 
02:30:38.410 --> 02:30:38.420 align:start position:0%
retiring early
 
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
just because they need to get out and
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully not get coveted so I think
 
02:30:49.309 --> 02:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
part of the issue obviously for a lot of
 
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
the agencies and I think some of them
 
02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
have mentioned is that there's a whole
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
new crowd of younger people that we need
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
to get engaged
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the system so that they can come in
 
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
and try to fill those gaps and obviously
 
02:31:09.170 --> 02:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
one of the issues would be pay and
 
02:31:10.670 --> 02:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
trying to recruit
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
so I think you're just one of the many
 
02:31:16.130 --> 02:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
organizations that's having the same
 
02:31:16.140 --> 02:31:17.210 align:start position:0%
organizations that's having the same
problem

02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
across the
 
02:31:25.070 --> 02:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.889 --> 02:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
I assume you agree with them yeah I
 
02:31:30.349 --> 02:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
agree I also do a lot of uh speaking at
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
high schools and trying to get kids
 
02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
interested and I like to think I could
 
02:31:35.809 --> 02:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
have been a used car salesman in another
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
life so maybe I could sell these kids on
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
being mental health professionals
 
02:31:42.290 --> 02:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
um but to my dismay not many of them
 
02:31:44.450 --> 02:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
raise their hand maybe one in a crowd of
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
30 40 kids and then it's I want to be a
 
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or I want to be something
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
else but not quite the boots on the
 
02:31:53.450 --> 02:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
ground person who has to work day to day
 
02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
with someone who's really struggling
 
02:31:56.450 --> 02:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
with a mental health issue in their home
 
02:31:58.370 --> 02:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
or in their community so
 
02:32:00.650 --> 02:32:00.660 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to ask if you could just
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
briefly talk about your ask here and
 
02:32:07.439 --> 02:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
briefly talk about your ask here and
um

02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:10.490 --> 02:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
how much you're proposing for rate
 
02:32:17.410 --> 02:32:17.420 align:start position:0%
increase for the Medicaid rate and then
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the housing
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
support how that would work
 
02:32:24.530 --> 02:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to ask you to look at
 
02:32:27.309 --> 02:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
the chart that's included in terms of
 
02:32:30.290 --> 02:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
our Research into terms of what we're
 
02:32:31.929 --> 02:32:31.939 align:start position:0%
paying people right now in our system
 
02:32:34.730 --> 02:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
and what
 
02:32:37.790 --> 02:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
other people pay in the system and how
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
far behind we are in that so we did the
 
02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
math for you that says you know we'd be
 
02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
a lot closer if we came up with about 28
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars to pay our staff right
 
02:32:49.969 --> 02:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
um because we're this far off with our
 
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists with our nurse
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
practitioners with our master's level
 
02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:54.710 align:start position:0%
practitioners with our master's level
clinicians

02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
clinicians
 
02:32:57.650 --> 02:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
um and so I mean I can give it to Jim in
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
terms of the housing numbers but I know
 
02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
that when up my staff quit and I'm
 
02:33:04.610 --> 02:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
paying them 18 to 21 an hour and they
 
02:33:07.849 --> 02:33:07.859 align:start position:0%
say go on a Hobby Lobby and I won't have
 
02:33:09.650 --> 02:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
to work nights or weekends if I don't
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
have any mandated overtime or anything
 
02:33:14.330 --> 02:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
so it was very nice working with you and
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
I'll see you later and I say that's a
 
02:33:18.290 --> 02:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
darn shame because I really want you to
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
go on and get your master's degree and
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
do more for this population and work
 
02:33:24.650 --> 02:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
with us a lot longer I can't do that if
 
02:33:27.050 --> 02:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not paying them a livable wage right
 
02:33:29.410 --> 02:33:29.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking a lot of them
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
so I have two questions for you about
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
the 28 million number what
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
what is that in terms of a percentage
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
increase and then how did you arrive at
 
02:33:41.330 --> 02:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
28 million was that like a one of those
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
disciplined Personnel pay scale analyzes
 
02:33:47.210 --> 02:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
or is that due to your experience and
 
02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:48.830 align:start position:0%
or is that due to your experience and
judgment

02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
02:33:52.730 --> 02:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:33:55.790 --> 02:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
um so and I apologize the author of the
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh the study was not available to be
 
02:33:59.090 --> 02:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
here today but we can bring it back if
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
you want but um yes it was
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
a pay scale analysis if that's the term
 
02:34:07.309 --> 02:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
used well we took a look at
 
02:34:08.990 --> 02:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
um across the 10 Community Mental Health
 
02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
Centers in these clinical disciplines
 
02:34:13.849 --> 02:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
what the what the the wage scale look
 
02:34:15.710 --> 02:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
like and then compared it to those to
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Labor Statistics and then
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
when we analyze the differential we'd
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
applied it over the number of positions
 
02:34:24.050 --> 02:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
that we have so that's where we came up
 
02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
with the uh 28 million now that's in the
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
context of uh
 
02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
um annual spend of about 120 million
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in the Medicaid Program
 
02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
to the Community Mental Health Centers
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
so it's a 16 18
 
02:34:40.010 --> 02:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
um increase okay
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and then the other question is I I
 
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
see what you're trying to do with pay
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
I think our lever is Medicaid
 
02:34:51.889 --> 02:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates though
 
02:34:55.010 --> 02:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and and so do you have specific CPT
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
codes that you think we ought to focus
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
on and do you have a recommendation more
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
at the procedure code level is that the
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
right question representative Stringham
 
02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm dancing on your area well
 
02:35:10.730 --> 02:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
you know I saw you had OCC codes and I
 
02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you're paid based on
 
02:35:15.410 --> 02:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
hourly uh and whether the rates are set
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
by these OCC codes when you come up with
 
02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh mean hourly wages and I mean I would
 
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
think that's probably where you were
 
02:35:26.349 --> 02:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
going if you wrote it this way
 
02:35:26.359 --> 02:35:28.330 align:start position:0%
going if you wrote it this way
so

02:35:28.330 --> 02:35:28.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:31.370 --> 02:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
if you could provide any tutorial on how
 
02:35:34.370 --> 02:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
your your fee schedule is set up
 
02:35:36.290 --> 02:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
um because you know certainly in here we
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
see there there's some OCC codes that uh
 
02:35:42.410 --> 02:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
it looks like you're paid over cost in
 
02:35:44.929 --> 02:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
one category and and some of the other
 
02:35:46.610 --> 02:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
ones are quite severely in the other
 
02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:47.630 align:start position:0%
ones are quite severely in the other
direction

02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to indicate that if if
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
we can adjust by the OCC code we may
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize some of them in
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
changing the rates over others I'm not
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with the term OCC what is an
 
02:36:01.439 --> 02:36:03.170 align:start position:0%
familiar with the term OCC what is an
OCC

02:36:03.170 --> 02:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
OCC
 
02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:09.610 --> 02:36:09.620 align:start position:0%
is it
 
02:36:12.530 --> 02:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
occupation code yes yeah that's the
 
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Statistics versus the I
 
02:36:16.490 --> 02:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
believe right the Imperial decision
 
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
versus the American Metal coding you're
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
talking about is the health care
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
Coatings but if but if it would be
 
02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
helpful the you may or may not be aware
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
of it there was a significant reform
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
five years ago where the Community
 
02:36:30.290 --> 02:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers moved away from a
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
fee-for-service system we now have a
 
02:36:35.090 --> 02:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
system where the centers take risk and
 
02:36:36.770 --> 02:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
they get paid on a per member per month
 
02:36:36.780 --> 02:36:38.450 align:start position:0%
they get paid on a per member per month
basis

02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think
 
02:36:42.010 --> 02:36:42.020 align:start position:0%
um with regards to your question about
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
these how these
 
02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
rates translate into wages
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a now okay
 
02:36:53.330 --> 02:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
my my question isn't on that because I
 
02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
can't directly affect your wages so we
 
02:36:58.429 --> 02:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
we have a lever we can change a
 
02:37:01.250 --> 02:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate and hope that that
 
02:37:03.530 --> 02:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
triggering of that reimbursement rate
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
change gives you the capacity to change
 
02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
your own wages we're not we're not
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
managing wages we're managing
 
02:37:14.090 --> 02:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates I believe does
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
anyone disagree with that
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
that's what it sounds like because it's
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
a capitated model so you get paid
 
02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I know you know you may have more
 
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
than one category for Peak how many four
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
four separate categories and there's a
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
rate for each one of them
 
02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
um what would be
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
more actionable on our side is probably
 
02:37:38.399 --> 02:37:40.490 align:start position:0%
more actionable on our side is probably
understand

02:37:40.490 --> 02:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:37:44.690 --> 02:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
um uh which of those uh whether whether
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
those all all four are under under
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed or under the fee schedule is
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
too low universally or whether there's
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
some that's end up resulting in critical
 
02:38:00.349 --> 02:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
shortages because they require a lot
 
02:38:00.359 --> 02:38:02.389 align:start position:0%
shortages because they require a lot
more

02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
clinical and counseling psychologists
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
which are you know 45 percent underpaid
 
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
right now I guess according to your
 
02:38:10.429 --> 02:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
system so
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just gonna uh thank you for
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
the for the question and the follow-up
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
commentary uh the four categories are
 
02:38:20.210 --> 02:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
are all the eligibility categories under
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
our state rules for eligibility for
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
services that's not the same as the CPT
 
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
codes that representative Edwards is is
 
02:38:29.929 --> 02:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
uh asking about and I don't know that
 
02:38:31.849 --> 02:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
our analysis here really fleshes out
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
which of those areas of the fee schedule
 
02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
would need to be addressed specifically
 
02:38:41.210 --> 02:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
in order to uh you know to to make sure
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
types of services are receiving the
 
02:38:47.210 --> 02:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
right reimbursement so you know we've
 
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
sort of basically asked at this point on
 
02:38:52.250 --> 02:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
sort of the Gap that we have and and
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming we're working with uh
 
02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
Henry Litman in the Medicaid office to
 
02:38:57.469 --> 02:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
see you know how does that actually
 
02:38:59.389 --> 02:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
break out in terms of the underlying fee
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
schedule that is used to determine the
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
rates for
 
02:39:09.170 --> 02:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:11.450 --> 02:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
so what we're struggling with is my
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
ignorance uh because I I just need to
 
02:39:16.990 --> 02:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand
 
02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
what would what a an hb2 item would look
 
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
like are would we be increasing
 
02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
potentially these these four occs or
 
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.050 --> 02:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
an example
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
um to all the committee members of some
 
02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
targeted rate increases that were done
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 to give you an idea of what
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
that looked like that did not reference
 
02:39:46.250 --> 02:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
specific codes it referenced specific
 
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
types of services and providers so that
 
02:39:49.490 --> 02:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
might be something you'd like to
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
consider instead
 
02:39:54.349 --> 02:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
well since 2017 I've heard that maybe
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
their their fee structures have moved
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
away from fee for schedule to a
 
02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
capitated rate and so I don't know if
 
02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
the 2017 example matches what our
 
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
current situation is I I just it's I
 
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
literally don't know
 
02:40:13.130 --> 02:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure either but I think that's
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
something I could look into for you
 
02:40:17.889 --> 02:40:17.899 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
02:40:20.990 --> 02:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we could give Mr Lemon also to be
 
02:40:22.849 --> 02:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
looking at it because I think he's
 
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
working on a homework I'm I'm talking
 
02:40:27.170 --> 02:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
past you to Mr White he because he's
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
looking at sort of the crisis fixes and
 
02:40:35.270 --> 02:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so so he could help us with this
 
02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:39.230 align:start position:0%
and so so he could help us with this
right

02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.389 --> 02:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
all right so we can certainly be uh
 
02:40:43.309 --> 02:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
responsive to that I think that you know
 
02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
as I've seen it uh dealt with in the
 
02:40:48.170 --> 02:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
budget before it's uh it's done through
 
02:40:50.270 --> 02:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
a combination of appropriation that is
 
02:40:52.370 --> 02:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
then footnoted with instructions to the
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
department for how to uh allocate or
 
02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
spend the funds that that would be very
 
02:40:59.809 --> 02:40:59.819 align:start position:0%
useful and I'm not promising that we'll
 
02:41:02.770 --> 02:41:02.780 align:start position:0%
add anything to it I'm just looking for
 
02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
what the vehicle would look like if the
 
02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee chose to do that was happy to
 
02:41:10.309 --> 02:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
provide the road map to success all
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
right so go ahead representative moving
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
beyond I guess the four categories of
 
02:41:17.570 --> 02:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
eligibility for services separately talk
 
02:41:20.030 --> 02:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
about residential housing support and
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a pretty separate
 
02:41:24.550 --> 02:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
category and your recommendation or or
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
request there is uh to raise the rate
 
02:41:36.170 --> 02:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
um to from 232 79 to between 265 and 374
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
a day so so that would be a range of
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
13.9 percent
 
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
um you know presumably over the two
 
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
years to sixty percent is that correct
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
and is there anything else that you want
 
02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:49.309 align:start position:0%
and is there anything else that you want
to

02:41:49.309 --> 02:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:41:49.319 --> 02:41:49.969 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:41:49.969 --> 02:41:49.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:51.889 --> 02:41:51.899 align:start position:0%
you know to help us understand the need
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
and uh what we get from that
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
thanks uh yeah you've correctly
 
02:41:58.849 --> 02:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
identified the ass there
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and in addition to that
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
um in order to help offset the capital
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
costs associated with that we've also
 
02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
asked for a one-time
 
02:42:10.429 --> 02:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 1.5 million dollars to
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh fund sick to contribute twenty five
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars towards
 
02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
for each per bed but I think um maybe
 
02:42:22.849 --> 02:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
um Maggie pritch's best to answer the
 
02:42:26.270 --> 02:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right I'm gonna date myself now so
 
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
um the two the two 3279 rate that we
 
02:42:35.389 --> 02:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
currently get for housing is for
 
02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
Community residents so that means it's a
 
02:42:40.849 --> 02:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
person living in 24-hour care there's
 
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
someone on site with them
 
02:42:46.370 --> 02:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
the rate at one point was so low most
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
centers walked away from being able to
 
02:42:51.530 --> 02:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
provide 24-hour care because they
 
02:42:53.450 --> 02:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
couldn't cover their cost you'd have to
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
have like 50 people living in the place
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
in order to break even right with the
 
02:43:00.410 --> 02:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
rate that you were getting we're trying
 
02:43:02.210 --> 02:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
to get back to a place where we
 
02:43:04.429 --> 02:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
recognize the need that people have for
 
02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
24-Hour care but we also recognize the
 
02:43:11.330 --> 02:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
expense of 24-hour care and so at 232 a
 
02:43:13.990 --> 02:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
day if you have 10 adults that
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
participate and follow all the federal
 
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
rules and state rules that are required
 
02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
for a community residence you can
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
probably afford to do that right you
 
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
might even be able to afford it six or
 
02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:24.710 align:start position:0%
might even be able to afford it six or
seven

02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
um and so we want to make sure that that
 
02:43:29.330 --> 02:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
rate covers the cost because the night
 
02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
shift is very hard to cover I will tell
 
02:43:33.050 --> 02:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
you that right now no one wants to be
 
02:43:36.110 --> 02:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
awake overnight and nobody wants to be
 
02:43:39.170 --> 02:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
doing this kind of care so that rate in
 
02:43:41.450 --> 02:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
particular is for those people who need
 
02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
24-hour care that we are seeing many of
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
them fall through gaps not being able to
 
02:43:48.410 --> 02:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
make it in the community because there
 
02:43:51.050 --> 02:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
isn't 24-hour care available and there
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
could be less available if we don't do
 
02:43:54.530 --> 02:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
something about that rate
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with HP 527 if you've
 
02:44:00.290 --> 02:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
seen it or looked at it heard about it
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sure Susan gave it to me but I don't
 
02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
because because this sounds similar and
 
02:44:08.210 --> 02:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
I and I and again I I'm just addressing
 
02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
a gap in my knowledge of whether or not
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
the requests that you you all may be
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
advancing would simultaneously be
 
02:44:20.090 --> 02:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
hitting the same Target that HP 527 was
 
02:44:22.610 --> 02:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
intended to hit Yes mine is saying if HP
 
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
527 was it was addressing a specific
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
class of long-term care assisted living
 
02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:29.450 align:start position:0%
class of long-term care assisted living
facilities

02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:44:32.270 --> 02:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
um in asking for a carve out for an
 
02:44:34.370 --> 02:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
additional reimbursement level for that
 
02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
this is different than that because it's
 
02:44:38.330 --> 02:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
not the long-term care population and
 
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for a carve out for a
 
02:44:43.010 --> 02:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
particular subset of housing we're
 
02:44:47.210 --> 02:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
asking for a cost adjustment to the
 
02:44:49.730 --> 02:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
to the per diem rate that's paid to all
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
providers in the same class
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the it's the all provider thing that
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering is is if is is if
 
02:44:59.389 --> 02:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
we're as we're if if to the extent that
 
02:45:02.030 --> 02:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
we try to come up with a partial
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
solution to your problem
 
02:45:06.590 --> 02:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
because of of trying to solve your
 
02:45:09.469 --> 02:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
problem Are we simultaneously solving
 
02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
some of the problems of 527 I see you
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
saying no representative
 
02:45:18.050 --> 02:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
totally different group yep and that
 
02:45:19.490 --> 02:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
five times they operate under a separate
 
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
waiver oh okay that answers my question
 
02:45:26.349 --> 02:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:29.090 --> 02:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
for example in an amendment to House
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 527 it says specifically that it
 
02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
would be applicable to those uh who are
 
02:45:38.210 --> 02:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
licensed under administrative rule he
 
02:45:42.170 --> 02:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:52.610 --> 02:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
all right I I'm out of questions are
 
02:45:54.650 --> 02:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
there any other further questions from
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:45:58.730 --> 02:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
just say a word about the about the
 
02:45:58.740 --> 02:46:00.309 align:start position:0%
just say a word about the about the
capital

02:46:00.309 --> 02:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
capital
 
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation that you have here
 
02:46:06.110 --> 02:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
you wanted to I mean it's twenty five
 
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per bed uh yeah new bed
 
02:46:11.690 --> 02:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
yep and I'm I guess
 
02:46:13.969 --> 02:46:13.979 align:start position:0%
um that certainly would not cover the
 
02:46:15.889 --> 02:46:15.899 align:start position:0%
cost it was based upon and I have to go
 
02:46:17.150 --> 02:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
back and do the math but I think it was
 
02:46:20.270 --> 02:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
on trying to stand up 60 beds
 
02:46:21.650 --> 02:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
um at a close to 25
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
000 uh the average
 
02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
five in a group setting would be five
 
02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
individuals so that the actual Capital
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
cost about 75 000 per bed so we're
 
02:46:33.050 --> 02:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
asking for a third of that as I hope I
 
02:46:36.410 --> 02:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:39.050 --> 02:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
to be honest if the folks from Seacoast
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
mental health were here they'd say I
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
can't buy anything for 450 000
 
02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:45.650 align:start position:0%
can't buy anything for 450 000
yeah

02:46:45.650 --> 02:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh and then just uh backing into the you
 
02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
know the 28 million dollar figure uh
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
this included here that is total fund
 
02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
total funds
 
02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and um uh so the general fund portion
 
02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:04.010 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:47:04.010 --> 02:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm not seeing any more
 
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
questions for from the committee you're
 
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
you're satisfied that you know what you
 
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
need to know at this point I just just
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
so the committee knows and and and those
 
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the audience
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Stringham in his uh
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
real world life uh deals a lot with
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare uh reimbursable issues and so
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh I've asked him to kind of take point
 
02:47:34.730 --> 02:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
or take the lead for division three and
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
trying to help us understand and
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
navigate you know these critical fixes
 
02:47:41.570 --> 02:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
that we have to Prior or consider
 
02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
prioritizing so
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so I know what I don't know and I
 
02:47:47.929 --> 02:47:47.939 align:start position:0%
don't know what he knows so so I'm
 
02:47:49.849 --> 02:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
asking and I hope you're still
 
02:47:51.889 --> 02:47:51.899 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that that you can take
 
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
the continue to take the lead for the
 
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
division to chart understand and
 
02:47:58.130 --> 02:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
contextualize this well I don't I don't
 
02:47:59.929 --> 02:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
know if I can take the lead because you
 
02:48:01.370 --> 02:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
know you've seen one fee schedule you've
 
02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
seen one fee schedule and um I've seen
 
02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:06.469 align:start position:0%
seen one fee schedule and um I've seen
one

02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
so um but but it is interesting
 
02:48:12.770 --> 02:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
um to to draw a reference to the other
 
02:48:15.050 --> 02:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
fee schedules I've worked with and but I
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
still uh need everybody else's help here
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
too what what's logical and
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
um just one person so
 
02:48:26.570 --> 02:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the kind words
 
02:48:29.929 --> 02:48:29.939 align:start position:0%
all right so um your your excuse thank
 
02:48:31.969 --> 02:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
you for coming I did you get a chance to
 
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
say everything you intended to say
 
02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:35.330 align:start position:0%
say everything you intended to say
okay

02:48:35.330 --> 02:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:48:39.290 --> 02:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
oh okay very good uh anyone else in the
 
02:48:41.210 --> 02:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh audience
 
02:48:44.809 --> 02:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
Dr Dr hen I now I have to start calling
 
02:48:46.190 --> 02:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
you Dr hen
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
no okay all right
 
02:48:52.130 --> 02:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
um so so I'm gonna close the hearing but
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take another 60 seconds
 
02:48:56.330 --> 02:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
with the division so that closes our
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
work session uh today
 
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
um then for
 
02:49:04.490 --> 02:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
the committee I I I think that the next
 
02:49:07.490 --> 02:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
time we're supposed to get together is
 
02:49:11.690 --> 02:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh is next week it's the 27th right
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
Monday the 27th no no this I still have
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:20.570 --> 02:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
it is the next meeting date that's been
 
02:49:22.610 --> 02:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
scheduled is Monday the 6th and you have
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
a full committee meeting in the morning
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
and a division meeting in the afternoon
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
to address bills
 
02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you'll also have more agency
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
presentations on Tuesday and Wednesday
 
02:49:33.230 --> 02:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
that will be scheduled today and I did
 
02:49:35.210 --> 02:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
have one question for you
 
02:49:37.250 --> 02:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you would be
 
02:49:39.170 --> 02:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
willing to meet for the final
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
presentation on Tuesday the
 
02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
that'd be the 13th the 14th
 
02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:46.969 align:start position:0%
that'd be the 13th the 14th
um

02:49:46.969 --> 02:49:46.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:49.010 --> 02:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
that is town meeting day and in the past
 
02:49:50.570 --> 02:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
members have been reluctant to meet on
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
town meeting day so I was wondering what
 
02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:59.330 --> 02:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
town meeting day in Auburn tends to be
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
in the morning
 
02:50:03.469 --> 02:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
so so it's not the whole day that would
 
02:50:06.290 --> 02:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
be problematic in my scenario it would
 
02:50:09.650 --> 02:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
just be the morning does anyone
 
02:50:12.349 --> 02:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
have a I have a problem with some of you
 
02:50:14.330 --> 02:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
are like moderators and stuff who you
 
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
got to be there I'm an artist's evening
 
02:50:19.130 --> 02:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
I'm just I believe it's 6 p.m so as long
 
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
okay so so just it's generally yes I'll
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
give everyone a chance to go back and
 
02:50:43.849 --> 02:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
look at their town meeting uh
 
02:50:45.770 --> 02:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
obligations and let you know if there's
 
02:50:48.290 --> 02:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
a crisis okay that may be the only way
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
to get in one of the divisions that had
 
02:50:51.790 --> 02:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
to be postponed from an earlier date
 
02:50:54.530 --> 02:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
they're the division that didn't want us
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
to meet with them probably
 
02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
no no they're originally going to be
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled for Monday but you have the
 
02:51:02.210 --> 02:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
full committee and bills online
 
02:51:03.889 --> 02:51:03.899 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:51:03.899 --> 02:51:04.969 align:start position:0%
all right
um

02:51:04.969 --> 02:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:07.070 --> 02:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
well great and then let's not forget
 
02:51:09.889 --> 02:51:09.899 align:start position:0%
that Friday it's still possible I think
 
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
to jump on a sununu center tour at 8 30
 
02:51:17.150 --> 02:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
over at the sununu center uh you only
 
02:51:19.130 --> 02:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
have three people who've said yes from
 
02:51:21.410 --> 02:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
the whole committee right there are four
 
02:51:23.090 --> 02:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
members and possibly a guest of
 
02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
Representative Stringham I'm not sure
 
02:51:27.050 --> 02:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
yet so that leaves uh three three to
 
02:51:28.670 --> 02:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
five slots available for other members
 
02:51:30.770 --> 02:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
if anybody else wants to attend all
 
02:51:33.410 --> 02:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
right so just let Mr Ripple know
 
02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:34.070 align:start position:0%
right so just let Mr Ripple know
um

02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing or I do we have something
 
02:51:37.500 --> 02:51:39.410 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing or I do we have something
else

02:51:39.410 --> 02:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
