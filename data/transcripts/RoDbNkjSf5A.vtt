which is celebrating its 250th
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
anniversary this year
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
i come before you this morning to
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
introduce hb 1163 relative to overvoted
 
00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.629 align:start position:0%
introduce hb 1163 relative to overvoted
ballots

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
on which you did not look favorably
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
but it died on the table
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
and since then we've had the audit of
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
the 2020 wyndham election results to
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
show how important the provisions of
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
this bill are to fair elections
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
if the provisions of these bills had
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
been in place in 2020
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
what happened in wyndham where shadows
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
created by the foals in the ballots
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
caused the machines to count them as
 
00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.469 align:start position:0%
caused the machines to count them as
overvotes

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
overvotes
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
would not have been possible
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping you will look more favorably
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
on the bill this year
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i have some visual aids here because
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
i am a teacher
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
an overvote happens when more than one
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
allowable number of votes have been made
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
for an office or a ballot question
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
so if you can see this
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
this voter
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
has filled in both ovals
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
neither santa or oscar the grouch gets a
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
vote for this
 
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.550 align:start position:0%
vote for this
okay

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
when a voter fills in her ballot like
 
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.589 align:start position:0%
when a voter fills in her ballot like
this

00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
in communities with vote counting
 
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.629 align:start position:0%
in communities with vote counting
machines

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
and in communities where hand counting
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
occurs this voter's choice will not be
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
but let me show you some other ways that
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
and see if you can tell me if you can
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
determine the voter's intent
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
with that ballot
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
i thought this was stiffer paper
 
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.750 align:start position:0%
i thought this was stiffer paper
okay

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.350 align:start position:0%
okay
santa

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
santa
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
here's another version
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
two filled in ovals
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
one x out initialed and the one that
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
stray marks are on the second oval
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
but it's clear when you look at this who
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
won that vote
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
this ballot was folded
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
and there's a shadow
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
coming through
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
the oval
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
but it's obvious
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
currently voters with these types of
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
marked ballots in towns where hand
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
counting occurs
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
will have their votes counted because
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
the voters intent is clear
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
but under our current system
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
voters in towns where machines count the
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
votes would lose their vote because the
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
machines record as over votes all these
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
kinds of marked ballots
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
this creates two classes of voters
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
the good news is our machines can be
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
programmed to reject overvoted ballots
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
returning them to the voter much like
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
that change machine returns the crinkle
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
dollar bill
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
to you at the laundromat
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what happens in vermont
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts rhode island connecticut
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
and many many other states maybe 49 of
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
them because section 301 of the hava act
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
of 2005
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
requires the voter be notified of the
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
overvote be informed of the consequences
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
and be given an opportunity to correct
 
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.150 align:start position:0%
and be given an opportunity to correct
it

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
including completing a new ballot if
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
need be
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
in fact when we were researching how
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
other states handle overvotes we often
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
were met with the surprise you don't do
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire it's the law
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
i have given you a document describing
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
how other states handle overvotes
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
hb 1193
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
as original
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
outlines a process we would like to see
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
happen in new hampshire
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
but we have heard concerns both from
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
these committee from committee members
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
in this committee and from the secretary
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
of state's office about parts of it and
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
so we have also drafted an amendment
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
which we believe addresses those
 
00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:23.350 align:start position:0%
which we believe addresses those
concerns

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the amendment would
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
be accepted or be acceptable to the
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
i've given you copies of the amendment
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
in both versions election day voter
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
privacy is projected as only the voter
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
looks at or handles the ballot
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the amendment election day voters and
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
absentee voters are treated in the same
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
manner with no opportunity to fix errors
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
and with the overvoted ballots from both
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
placed in an auxiliary compartment to be
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
counted at the end of the day
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
there are others behind me who will
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
offer more reasons to vote in favor of
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
this bill or the amendment either in its
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
original form or as amendment
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
what i want to leave you with
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 election in the town of
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
derry the machines were programmed to
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
record the number of overvotes
 
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:22.629 align:start position:0%
record the number of overvotes
overall

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.790 align:start position:0%
overall
4.7

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
4.7
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
of ballots
 
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.509 align:start position:0%
of ballots
counted

00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
counted
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
were counted as overvotes
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
one machine used solely was used solely
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
to count absentee ballots
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
no other ballots
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
on that machine
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
14.2 percent
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
of the ballots counted
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
570 of them
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
had overvotes
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
570 people who voted absentee lost their
 
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.310 align:start position:0%
570 people who voted absentee lost their
votes

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
leading me to believe the shadow issue
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
found in windham may have been more
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
widespread than we know
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
we have very close elections in new
 
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.829 align:start position:0%
we have very close elections in new
hampshire

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
they can be won or lost by a few votes
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
so every vote should count
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
i hope you will support us in this
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
effort and i'll be glad to take
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
seriously

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you madam
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative take my
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
question um you you just cited absentee
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
ballots yes dairy um however i i just
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
don't see the procedure for how we would
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
notify an absentee voter
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
that their ballot had overvote in the
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
same way that we would be able to notify
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
someone in person right because by the
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
time we realize it's an overvote we no
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
longer know who that ballot is from and
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
that's why we amended that language out
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
so the scenario you mentioned well
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be if if if the amended bill
 
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be if if if the amended bill
passes

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
all those absentee ballots will go into
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
an auxiliary to be counted and the
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
in-person voter will have their ballot
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
returned and the election official will
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
say please put it in this auxiliary bin
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be counted
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
later be encountered later so both kinds
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
of ballots will be hand counted at the
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
end of the day in the same way and the
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
election day voter will not be given the
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct it we think that
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
weakens it somewhat but if it will if
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
making these changes will allow this
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
process to proceed in new hampshire as
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
it does in all the other states i think
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's we're willing to compromise on that
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
issue appreciate the answer thank you
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative alexander
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative um so my question is this
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
is just regarding electronic ballot
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
accounting devices and not hand
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
counted towns
 
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.110 align:start position:0%
counted towns
um

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
um
why

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.710 align:start position:0%
why
so

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
why aren't we extending this to hand
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
counting towns
 
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
counting towns
in

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.629 align:start position:0%
in
so

00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
why are we letting
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting towns have
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
this opportunity but hand counting towns
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
not because in hand counting towns
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
the intent of the voter is clear when
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
they're counting the votes the problem
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
comes that the machine
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.110 align:start position:0%
comes that the machine
miscounts

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
miscounts
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
this as an overvote but if this ballot
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
came into a hand counting town
 
00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
came into a hand counting town
the

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
ballot counters would know santa won
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
this vote it wouldn't be oscar
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um so
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
what if the voter had an overvote in a
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
hand counting town
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that ballot wasn't
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
obviously was not like spit back out at
 
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
obviously was not like spit back out at
them

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
but it would it was it would be given
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to correct it in like a
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
machine counting town
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they would in a hand
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
counted town it would be noticed right
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
away because people would put their
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
ballot in the machine okay the only time
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
it would be noticed in a hand counting
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
town is when they're actually counting
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
the ballots at the end of the day
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
what happens the machines can be
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
programmed to count over votes and to
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
return over voted ballots and by the way
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
there's no extra charge for doing that
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's already done
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
the company that
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
does our machines does this for other
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
states so
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
the problem comes when the voter goes
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
into a
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
machine-counted town with an overvoted
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
ballot now the machine just takes it
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
but if this bill passed
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
that machine would spit it back out and
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
then it would go in an auxiliary to be
 
00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:48.310 align:start position:0%
then it would go in an auxiliary to be
counted

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
counted
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
so okay representative growing thank you
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative for
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.189 align:start position:0%
um
if

00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
a voter
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
actually overvotes
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
not not
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
an accidental mark or a fold or any of
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
that but it's it's an actual overvote
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.870 align:start position:0%
yeah um
if

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
the original version of the bill then
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
would require that
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
ballot to be passed back to the voter to
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
be correct is that correct
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
to give the voter the opportunity to
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
correct it and if you look at the sheet
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
that i gave you
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
with the email messages about how other
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
states handle this it talks about what
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
their voter manuals tell the election
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
officials to do when an overvoted ballot
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
is spit out
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay and follow-up questions
 
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.150 align:start position:0%
okay and follow-up questions
uh

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
then following up on representative
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
alexander's question
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the case of of the original version
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill yeah
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
a machine counted town a voter who
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
actually over voted
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
would be given an opportunity to correct
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
but a voter in a hand-counted town would
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
not be given an opportunity and that's
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
why we amended the bill so in that case
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
the amended version is better than the
 
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.190 align:start position:0%
the amended version is better than the
original

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
in a sense be in a sense because both
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
sets are treated in the same way right
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay this the amended version still
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't put us in compliance with the
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.669 align:start position:0%
federal law
but

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
it does allow
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
overvoted ballots to be looked at by a
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
set of eyes
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
and a decision made by the set of eyes
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
rather than the machine thank you
 
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.070 align:start position:0%
rather than the machine thank you
representative

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
madam chairman and thank you
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
representative porter for coming uh
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
would that be a privacy concern for the
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
hand counted towns to have a set of eyes
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
on that when the voter is there because
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.230 align:start position:0%
members of the
um

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
the town would know how the person voted
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
no no because in a hand-counted town the
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
person takes their ballot and puts it in
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
the ballot box no one looks at their
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
ballot until the end of the day and then
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
all the ballots are looked at and
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
counted so you're not going to know if
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
you're next to me how i voted because
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
i'm taking my ballot and putting it in a
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
hand counting ballot box
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's what happens in a hand counted
 
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.350 align:start position:0%
that's what happens in a hand counted
town

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
but in a machine town the voter puts the
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
ballot into the machine no one looks at
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
it and the machine would spit it back
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
out to the voter no one looks at it and
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
then the voter would put it in the box
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
no one looking at it until the end of
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.110 align:start position:0%
the day
representative

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.430 align:start position:0%
representative
barry

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
barry
 
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
barry
um

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is what you get when you say nobody
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
asked me questions just fyi
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
i'm actually glad that you're asking the
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions because it's not an easy thing
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
to get your head around um okay i have
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
two questions about i'm sure i will ask
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
for my follow-up so just to understand
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment because i don't support
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill because it creates
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
two classes of voters but the amendment
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
removes that problem yeah um so now i'm
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
talking speaking to the amendment yes so
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
a person with an overcast about in a
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
machine countdown puts the ballot in and
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
it spits it back out yes and then the
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
person standing there takes that ballot
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
and puts it in a box or goes to the
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
diverter no the machine can be
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
programmed to say over voted ballot so
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
the person puts it in
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
it spits back out the election worker
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
looks at the
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
machine and says to the voter
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
you have an overvote on that ballot
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
please put it in the auxiliary box to be
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
hand counted later so nobody but the
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
voter handles that ballot until the end
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
of the day when the ballots are all
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
counted right follow-up so this uh hey
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
that's better than what i was
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
envisioning um but it's still underlying
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
problem is still there so now the
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
voter's been told they have an
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
over voted ballot
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
it isn't that but they don't have the
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct it
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
isn't that going to create a
 
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
isn't that going to create a
a

00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
i would say dispute with the election
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
worker it might it might
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's why the language was in the
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
okay but that's
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
problematic language to many people
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
so it's been eliminated
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
it you know the rules that the secretary
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
of state sets up
 
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.029 align:start position:0%
of state sets up
for

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
processing these kinds of things can say
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
just tell
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
the voter that there's an um the machine
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't like your ballot put it in the
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
other the other box to have it counted
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
so if that that could be done and that's
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
a way to get around
 
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.750 align:start position:0%
a way to get around
fisticuffs

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
fisticuffs
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
at the election site
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
chair representative porter were you
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
aware that state law currently allows a
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
voter to
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
get a new ballot up to three times
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
i am aware that i don't think
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
voters are aware of that
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the reasons why in
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
we brought up the fact that the voter
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
could be told that he could get another
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
ballot if need be
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
but that created problems for
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office and for
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
many of these committee members
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
here so it was
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
but yeah there's an education process
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
that goes on that should be going on and
 
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
that goes on that should be going on and
maybe

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know notification on
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
town websites and things like that might
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
help people to know that but maybe we
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
can put another sign up
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
if you've been one of the election
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
worker who does those posters it's hard
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
to imagine but we could do another one
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien thank
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
you um i have kids
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i sometimes
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
have to make crazy signs around my house
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
to remind them to do things that i think
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
that should be self-explanatory
 
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.669 align:start position:0%
that should be self-explanatory
and

00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
you can imagine i'm a teacher yeah so
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
you've been there yeah
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
i aren't the ballots posted with the
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
amount of openings in a field
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
so it would say vote for three when
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
there are three yes openings but there
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
may be five candidates isn't that at the
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
top of every it is
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
list it is okay
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not saying that all the voters
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
read all the directions carefully
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay they and and you know what comes in
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
as a confusing
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
in my district in hillsborough we were
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
are currently represented in two house
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
districts a floatario and a base
 
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.630 align:start position:0%
districts a floatario and a base
district

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
and so and we can vote for two
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
candidates in each one of those
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
districts and when you look at that
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
ballot if you're not familiar with that
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
because it says state representative
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
vote for no more than two and then below
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
it it says state representative vote for
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
no more than two so here you've got four
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
you am i supposed to vote for four am i
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to only vote for two so people
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
who are not
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
um familiar with how things work and
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people like that um
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
often don't vote for the right number of
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
people because it's confusing
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
would you say that as things are now in
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
the absence of this bill being passed
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
that there are two classes of voters
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to overvoted ballots i
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
would say so because the voters in the
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
hand-counted towns get their votes
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
counted at least looked at by a pair of
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
eyes but voters in machine counted towns
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
do not so voters in machine countertown
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
could lose their vote
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
and those
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
people being voted for could lose that
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
vote as well i mean 570
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
over voted ballots in the town of derry
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of votes
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
you know that's a lot of votes to lose
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
in just one machine
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
oh i thought you did representative
 
00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
oh i thought you did representative
mcdonald

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
mcdonald
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman good morning
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you good
 
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.710 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you good
morning

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.750 align:start position:0%
morning
um

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
i have my uh my question is do we know
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
if the um
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
the ballot machines will be able to make
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
this determination immediately or if
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
it'll take several seconds to
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
it does it right away just like when you
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
put that dollar bill in
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
something's wrong it spits it back out
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
the machine's programmed to do the same
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
thing so you put the ballot in it might
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
accept it and the minute it sees an
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
overvote it comes back out
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
and there's no charge to anybody for
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
programming the machines that way we've
 
00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:40.789 align:start position:0%
programming the machines that way we've
checked

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
checked
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
the reason i bring that up obviously we
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
want to expedite the voting process as
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
smoothly as possible especially in the
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
heavy turnout election and that would be
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
a great concern potentially thank you
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the ballot machines
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
spit out ballots for other reasons
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
besides um
 
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.669 align:start position:0%
besides um
overvotes

00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
overvotes
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
i think i've seen people's ballots come
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
out and they have to feed him in a
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
couple of times because there's a glitch
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not unusual
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
it is supposed to be right there yes
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
have i forgotten my question
 
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.510 align:start position:0%
have i forgotten my question
um

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
my question is this if the machine is
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
going to spit it back out right
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
why does
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
why do i not have the opportunity at
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
that time to say or the person who's
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
next to the machine say to me
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
nothing like your ballot perhaps you
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
should take the right player and then my
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
vote would be
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
corrected and put in we can have three
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
ballots yes it seems to me i would get
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
my vote more accurately and maybe i
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
could get a little education as well
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
as what my problem was exactly
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative and that's why the
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
original bill was written the way it was
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
the problem is some people consider that
 
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.029 align:start position:0%
the problem is some people consider that
creating

00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
two classes of voters because voters in
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
hand counted towns
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
would not have that opportunity nobody
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
would know it was an overvoted ballot
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
until the time of counting at the end of
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
the day so those voters would not have a
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
chance to fix it
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand okay
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative quailey thank
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman and thank you
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
as a selectman i had the opportunity to
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
observe the mechanical function of
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
functioning of a voting machine
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
for many hours
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
and it was not uncommon
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
in our town at least for
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
a voter's ballot to be rejected upon the
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
first attempt
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
to submit it right
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
and it might take two even three tries i
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
suppose depending on initial alignment
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh and you're understanding a way for
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
the election worker to distinguish
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
distinguish between a ballot that's been
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
rejected for an overvote and a ballot
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's just simply been rejected because
 
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.310 align:start position:0%
that's just simply been rejected because
of

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
that kind of momentary difficulty yes my
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is the ballot counting
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
machines can be programmed so that when
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
an overvote is detected it says so right
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
on the screen at the top of the machine
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
so the bat the election worker could
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
look at the machine and it would after
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
the ballot came out and it would say
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien thank
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
you ma'am uh
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
i hope that i see our the dairytown
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
clerk here and i'm not sure he's going
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
to speak on this but
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
for that reason i'm going to ask you and
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the answer that's okay
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the interesting special
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
unusual dynamics that happened in the
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
dairy election because
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
we as candidates did anticipate that
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
there would be many overvotes but prior
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
to the election
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
i i am not familiar with the details
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
prior to the election actually i'm not
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
even gonna that question is you need to
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
rephrase that before you re-ask that
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
question of anybody because i'm not
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
going to allow that that was way too
 
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
going to allow that that was way too
leading

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
leading
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever okay
 
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.590 align:start position:0%
or whatever okay
what

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
anybody else for representative porter
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
that gives you time to rethink it
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
committee members and
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
have a good day i'm going to go down and
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
fight battles in education now
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
see this wasn't a battle though so there
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
you go all right next signed up to speak
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
committee i'm here in support of this
 
00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
committee i'm here in support of this
bill

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
to require the
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
val counting machines to be programmed
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
to return
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
over voted ballots
 
00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:08.630 align:start position:0%
over voted ballots
um

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
i find that
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
the important part of this bill is
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
actually in the sentence
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
the last sentence of part 1 which starts
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
on line 10 in the middle it says balance
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
of ab t voters and those who choose to
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
correct or replace the ballot
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
and choose not to correct or replace the
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
ballot shall be placed in the auxiliary
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
compartment and counted
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
i see by this requirement that
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
um every
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
ballot that has a
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
absent has an overvote
 
00:30:42.399 --> 00:30:43.190 align:start position:0%
absent has an overvote
will

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
segregated out and put into the
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
auxiliary compartment
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore every machine shall report
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
zero overvotes
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fix problems with undervotes
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
but it does
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate overvotes on the machines and
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
i see this as being
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
actually the most important part of the
 
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.590 align:start position:0%
actually the most important part of the
bill

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
change it so that the
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
in-person voter doesn't have the
 
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.029 align:start position:0%
in-person voter doesn't have the
opportunity

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:23.590 align:start position:0%
opportunity
to

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
correct the ballot
 
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.389 align:start position:0%
correct the ballot
but

00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
this is actually more important than the
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
few in-person voters who may over vote
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
or have stray marks on their ballot
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
because it eliminates the overvote
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
potential from the machines themselves
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i even think it's
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
we have to consider that it's more
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
important than whether or not we have
 
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.710 align:start position:0%
important than whether or not we have
two

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
classes of voters or even four classes
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
because we have voters in towns that
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to deal with machines and
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
know that their votes are going to be
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
looked at by hand county
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
as well as we have absentee voters
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
who get to vote from the comforter
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
living room or dining room or whatever
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
and don't have to drive anywhere in the
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
rain or snow or whatever to go vote
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh with that i urge that uh ought to
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
pass on this bill
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
i did want to
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
make one other comment on this
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
that last sentence in part one
 
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.549 align:start position:0%
that last sentence in part one
um

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
i see that as a possibility that first
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
phrase says balance of absentee voters
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
and those and continues um
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
it almost suggests that every
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot has to be hand counted
 
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.549 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot has to be hand counted
um

00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
so that sentence might be rephrased to
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
say and and this is in my written
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that you have and and also the
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
what i sent online
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
ballots of absentee voters returned for
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
an overvote and ballots of those who
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
choose not to correct or replace
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
the overvoted ballot shall be placed in
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
the auxiliary compartment and hand
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
that may need to be changed slightly if
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
you adopt the amendment proposed by
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
and i thank you and i will answer any
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
and we have i do have your written
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
testimony for the record here
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
and it has been submitted electronically
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
i live in the town of windham
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you all know the issues
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
that took place during the election
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
that were discovered after the audit of
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
and this i believe will address many of
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
the issues that were discovered
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
um but before i begin i'd just like to
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
suggest that this
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
election integrity bill
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
and it is for election integrity it's a
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan issue and that can be
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
reflected in the fact that you have
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors from both parties
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
that have signed on to this bill and i'm
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
grateful to all of those
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh reps and for doing so
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
i want to point out a couple of
 
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.710 align:start position:0%
i want to point out a couple of
um

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.909 align:start position:0%
um
things

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
that are related not just to windham but
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
to other towns as well
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
during the general election in 2020
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
you heard that derry had 4.7 percent
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
ballots had overvotes on them
 
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.829 align:start position:0%
ballots had overvotes on them
merrimack

00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
one of their machines tabulated a
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
massive number of 396 overvotes on
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
1738 ballots that's a
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
22.78 percent
 
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.670 align:start position:0%
22.78 percent
uh

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.270 align:start position:0%
uh
percentage

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
of ballots that had overvotes on it and
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
i am hard to believe that
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
nearly 23 out of 100 people
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
who put their ballots into that one
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
machine actually made that type of
 
00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:41.190 align:start position:0%
machine actually made that type of
mistake

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
on another machine in merrimack
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
there was only 14 overvotes out of
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
1856 ballots for a 0.75 so less than one
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
percent of the ballots so from 23
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
percent of the ballots in one machine
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
less than one percent in another machine
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is the statistics don't make sense
 
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.589 align:start position:0%
this is the statistics don't make sense
manchester

00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
had a machine that had 14.99 percent and
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
another machine that had 2.37 percent
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
windham had um
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
292 overvotes on one machine and 18 on
 
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.589 align:start position:0%
292 overvotes on one machine and 18 on
another

00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
so 8.9 percent versus 1.3 percent
 
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.550 align:start position:0%
so 8.9 percent versus 1.3 percent
hampton

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
hampton
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
had the same type of situation 9.51 on
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
one machine 1.65 on another
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
and those anomalies can be seen across
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
i've actually looked at the paper tapes
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
of all the towns across the state
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
and this is not just isolated to win him
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's an important issue because as
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
you heard in previous testimony
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
the machines can misread the ballots as
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
you've also seen in the
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
in the forensic auditor's report the
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
machines did actually misread ballots
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
when they were put through the machines
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
and when that happens
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
and it triggers an overvote those the
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
voters votes for that race are
 
00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
voters votes for that race are
disenfranchised

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not hundreds it's
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
thousands across the state it's many
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
many thousands across the state
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
cumulatively and that's
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's really not acceptable if we want
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our elections are
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
accurate and this is a very very very
 
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.550 align:start position:0%
accurate and this is a very very very
simple

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
the there were some questions i
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the questions that you
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
asked and i appreciate the answers that
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
rep porter gave
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
in response to those
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's my understanding uh with
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
talking with the secretary of state
 
00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:48.829 align:start position:0%
talking with the secretary of state
that

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
when the ballots go in
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
and they get rejected they they get read
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
as as an overvote it come out
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know in my conversations with him
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
and and in my experiences in the windham
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
voting in windham when the ballot
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't get taken
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
you're instructed go ahead try it again
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
try it again and you're right
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
it does take two or three times
 
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.190 align:start position:0%
it does take two or three times
sometimes

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
but after that in my conversations with
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlon you know if it rejects
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
it two or three times then the election
 
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.790 align:start position:0%
it two or three times then the election
official

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.910 align:start position:0%
official
can

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
instruct the voter to take the ballot
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
and put it in the auxiliary compartment
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to see that ballot but
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
the voter
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
and in this process
 
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.390 align:start position:0%
and in this process
the

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
the election official doesn't even need
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
to lean over and look at the machine
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
right because it's it's not really
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
changing anything
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
the only thing that changes if it
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
rejects it two or three times is now
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's an alternative let's put it in
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
the auxiliary compartment and the
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
benefit of that is is that these
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
machines are not going to falsely
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
tabulate overvotes and then
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise the voters
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
and and again as we see in the windham
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
election that's exactly what happened so
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
machines do make mistakes that's this is
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
not a theory it's been proven that that
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
actually happens
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
there was also concerns about
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
having two classes of voters well i
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
would suggest to you today that we
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
already have two classes of voters
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
that in the towns that hand count
 
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.829 align:start position:0%
that in the towns that hand count
ballots

00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
those votes the intention of the voter
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
are actually being counted
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
and with the machines as you as you saw
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
with some of these examples
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
ballots could have
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
you know in the in the case of a race
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
for either a single you know wherever
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's more ovals filled in
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
than are allowed someone might exit off
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then initial it i actually saw that
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
when i participated in the hand recount
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
for the windham
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
general election for the state rep race
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
and that was an education experience for
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
me because i i could see
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
that yes there are times where the
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
ballots actually would be
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
read as an overvote because of the way
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
that the voter filled in the ballot
 
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.510 align:start position:0%
that the voter filled in the ballot
but

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
in the recount
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
the intent was clearly known
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it was put off to the secretary of
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
state's office to decide that on
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
election night it's the election
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
officials who will decide that and i
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
is also part of election integrity
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
because you want the intent of the voter
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
to be honored at the end of the day
 
00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:30.790 align:start position:0%
to be honored at the end of the day
so

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
with the process that's outlined in the
 
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.630 align:start position:0%
with the process that's outlined in the
amendment

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
but if the ballot gets rejected
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
they get instructed to put it into the
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
auxiliary bin there are no two classes
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
of ballots anymore
 
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
of ballots anymore
the

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh secretary the secretary of state they
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
put together an election procedure
 
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.190 align:start position:0%
put together an election procedure
manual

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
manual
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
they could clearly
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
define what the election official should
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
say to the voters if their ballots get
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
rejected multiple times
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have to tell them you have an
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
overvoted ballot they could just say
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
please you know it's the machine's not
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking it please put it in the overvoted
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know in the auxiliary compartment
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
and everybody everybody's ballots are
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
treated the same then
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the sense that if there are
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know red over votes by a machine
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
that will that will be eliminated now
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
going forward and again it's thousands
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
and thousands of votes
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
and as you heard in previous testimony a
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
lot of these racism in new hampshire are
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
decided by
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
by just a handful of votes and if i
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
remember from a previous bill that
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
senator guida wrote
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
44 out of the last 45 elections were
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
decided by one vote or they were tied
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
so it's really critical that
 
00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:44.950 align:start position:0%
so it's really critical that
if

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
machines are going to be continue to be
 
00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.390 align:start position:0%
machines are going to be continue to be
used

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
that we try to eliminate
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
all of the potential errors that might
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
come up when we're using them
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that i've covered most of
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to do
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to say so i just thank you
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
for your time and please this is a very
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
important bill to pass please uh please
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass it is nonpartisan it
 
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.870 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass it is nonpartisan it
is

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
election integrity and after
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh the last two years there's quite a
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
few people who are concerned about the
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
trusting our elections right now and
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
this would go
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
quite a ways to doing so
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr eyring is does anyone have
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr erin
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you for coming
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
this morning also signed up to speak on
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is mary till i'm
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
a former town moderator in derry
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
and ever since i served on this very
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
election law committee in the
 
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.470 align:start position:0%
election law committee in the
legislature

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
i've made it my goal
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure that everyone who is eligible
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
to vote has the opportunity to vote and
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
to know that their vote has been
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
accurately counted
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
hb 1163 is one small step toward that
 
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.710 align:start position:0%
hb 1163 is one small step toward that
goal

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
part of the problem of being cleanup is
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
that most everybody has already said
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
what i was about to say so i'm going to
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
testimony very short basically saying
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
that i agree with everything that's been
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
said already
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
what 1163 does is ensure that the intent
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
of the voter is considered when counting
 
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.589 align:start position:0%
of the voter is considered when counting
votes

00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
made it clear in 2003
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
that intent of the voter is the legal
 
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
that intent of the voter is the legal
standard

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that's
 
00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:08.710 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that's
2003.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
2003.
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
in hand count towns the intent of voter
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
is noted and honored in machine count
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
towns the machine discounts votes as an
 
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.589 align:start position:0%
towns the machine discounts votes as an
overvote

00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
overvote
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
denying all candidates a vote in that
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
particular race
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
on that ballot
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
this is most egregious
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
in multi-seat races
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
like many new hampshire house seats
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
1163 requires a simple programming
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
change to return an overvoted ballot
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
directly to the person
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
in-person voter to be placed in the side
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
pocket it's free because
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
as was stated
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
lhs has written this program for our
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
neighboring states who have been using
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
it for years
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm basically going to say please
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation so hundreds of
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
thousands or thousands of new hampshire
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
voters will not be
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
discarded votes will not be discarded in
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
upcoming elections
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
let every vote be counted
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's time
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
support the amendment that's been
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
proposed on at the request of the
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you miss till
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative quailey
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that ballots with
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
a write-in vote
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
are automatically segregated into an
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
auxiliary compartment by the machine
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh if the same kind of action were taken
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
automatically by the machine for
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
a ballot that it detected an overvote on
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
would there be uh
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
how to put this a an onerous burden of
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
separating out the
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
write-in the ballots with right-in votes
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
from those that are judged to have
 
00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.390 align:start position:0%
from those that are judged to have
overvotes

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
overvotes
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
so that both could be hand-counted at
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.829 align:start position:0%
the end of the
day

00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
so excuse me
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
so it would not be onerous really to
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
separate them because you can see a
 
00:46:19.599 --> 00:46:21.990 align:start position:0%
separate them because you can see a
handwriting

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
handwriting
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
person but the fact is it wouldn't even
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
happen because
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
one cannot tell
 
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:29.910 align:start position:0%
one cannot tell
um

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
by quickly scanning
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
a ballot that there's an overvote on it
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
we don't know why that ballot ended up
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
in that pocket that's why we're asking
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
the voter to put it in a third pocket
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's called the auxiliary pocket
 
00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.950 align:start position:0%
that's called the auxiliary pocket
where

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
the entire ballot is recounted
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
right in pocket we only have to recount
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
the write-ins
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for coming
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
and representative taurosian if you
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
could get me the clipboard at some point
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
that would be great this is the last
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee i'm david scanlan secretary of
 
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.829 align:start position:0%
committee i'm david scanlan secretary of
state

00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
would be in opposition to the original
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill hb 1163 consistent with past
 
00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.109 align:start position:0%
bill hb 1163 consistent with past
testimony

00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
and i won't repeat that testimony
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
because you've heard it
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
many times in the past
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
but i will say that that the amendment
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
submitted by representative porter
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
amendment number 757h
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
is something that
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office could
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
get behind
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
it does not create a an additional class
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
voter but hold on deputy scanlan could
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
you give me that amendment number again
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment number that i'm looking at
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
is 757 h well then i think we have a
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
problem because that's not the amendment
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
seven four one h yeah
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
repre uh i'm just gonna allow a little
 
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
repre uh i'm just gonna allow a little
uh

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
changing committee process here mr
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
eyring do you know what the issue is
 
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:33.990 align:start position:0%
eyring do you know what the issue is
here

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
i do you know what amendment number
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
all right you want to approach deputy
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
scanlon very quickly because it looks
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
like he has both amendments and if you
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
can point out the difference please just
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
to him very quickly he's got them both
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
there i'm going to allow that to happen
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
because if it's one word that should
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
have taken a lot
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
quicker so
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're not going to go talking about
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
amendments we don't have and
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have to figure this out exact
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
session so
 
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
session so
deputy

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
deputy
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlan thank you madam chair
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
the the amendments are essentially the
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
same there is some minor wording that
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a closer uh look at
 
00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a closer uh look at
but

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
but the uh
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the position that i
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
would have relative to this amendment
 
00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:10.390 align:start position:0%
would have relative to this amendment
where

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
if a
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
a ballot was placed in the machine that
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
contained an overvote
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
that ballot was rejected
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
returned to the voter to be placed in an
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
auxiliary bin so that it could be hand
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
counted later
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
is something that we would support
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
i think that had
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
a system like that been in place
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
in windham given the issue that they had
 
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:34.790 align:start position:0%
in windham given the issue that they had
with

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
the fault on the ballot
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
causing the machine to perceive an
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
overvote when one did not exist that
 
00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:42.470 align:start position:0%
overvote when one did not exist that
that

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
issue would have been uh
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
not completely taken care of but it
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
would not have been to the degree that
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
that that actually occurred
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
i will say just just to address some
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
comments that were made earlier about
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
the current state of the law
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the federal
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
the federal harbour statute
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
does have a requirement in there where
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
machines reject overvotes
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
in in states
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
that there is also an exemption in that
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
same statute that applies to new
 
00:51:17.119 --> 00:51:18.390 align:start position:0%
same statute that applies to new
hampshire

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
that says that those states that have
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
paper-based systems that provide
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
instructions to voters on how to
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
properly mark their ballot
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
is exempt from that requirement and so
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
that is the exemption that new hampshire
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
has used all of these years i'm not
 
00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.710 align:start position:0%
has used all of these years i'm not
aware

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.670 align:start position:0%
aware
of

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
how many other states may take advantage
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
of that same exemption but we certainly
 
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.190 align:start position:0%
of that same exemption but we certainly
do

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
in section two of the bill i would say
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
that that there's a
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
requirement in here that for each
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
contest or ballot question
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
the number of overvotes and undervotes
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
be recorded
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's a fairly easy thing to
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
record overvotes
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
it may not be as easy to to do
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
undervotes especially in hand count
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
towns so
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know i would suggest for the time
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
being that we drop
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
and undervotes on line 16
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
of the original bill
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
until we have an opportunity to
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
think more about how appropriate that
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
and then i would like to just address
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
represent quality's question about
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know can write in votes and overvote
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
ballots be sent to the same
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
bin uh in the uh in the
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
under the accuvope machine
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
i i think that would be confusing
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
because in the case of write-in votes
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
the the the ballot is counted except for
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
the office or offices that contain the
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
write-in votes
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then when they're counted by hand
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's just those offices that have the
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
right in votes
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
that are counted whereas
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
if there's an overvote
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason for why a ballot
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
was rejected the entire ballot needs to
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
be counted and so i think for that
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
reason alone it would be best to keep
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
those ballots separate to eliminate the
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
confusion and the potential count hours
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
errors that might occur as a result of
 
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.309 align:start position:0%
errors that might occur as a result of
that

00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
with that i would be happy to try and
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.829 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
00:53:26.079 --> 00:53:28.150 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlon a
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
question on the term undervotes i know
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
that the reports of the accuvope
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
machines use the word blanks is that the
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
same thing as under votes
 
00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.549 align:start position:0%
same thing as under votes
um

00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not completely sure i know i know a
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
blank would be if there was an office
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
that simply had no votes on it
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure whether the whether the
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
machine would
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
consider a blank
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
a situation where it's vote for four and
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
the voter only uh marked three i'd wanna
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
research that and get back to you
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron you're referring
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the tape at the end of the night that
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
has the blank number
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
it says it uses the word blanks
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't say under votes i'm just
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
wondering what that word what that
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
accomplishes okay
 
00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:17.829 align:start position:0%
accomplishes okay
representative

00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:20.230 align:start position:0%
representative
barry

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
barry
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
so the machines have the diverter in
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
there for the write-ins that put them
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
into a separate spot and your concern
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
is that it counts everything but the
 
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.589 align:start position:0%
is that it counts everything but the
write-in

00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
write-in
 
00:54:33.599 --> 00:54:34.390 align:start position:0%
write-in
um

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
people at the end of the night have to
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
count that they just count that one
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
candidate right couldn't we reprogram
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
the machines to if there's a write-in
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
they don't count the ballot at all they
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
just put it in the diverter and then at
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
the end of the night and we do the same
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
thing for overvotes right it all goes
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
into the basically these the the ballots
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
that go into the bin the diverted bin
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
are just not not they're not counted but
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't want somebody to pull a weird clip
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
on the internet but they're not counted
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
by the machine they're counted entirely
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
every office by hand at the united
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't we do that and that would kind
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
of have our cake and eat it too
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that the
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
software programming could
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
could occur that might accomplish that i
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
would have to see how
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
involved that would be it would require
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
an additional approval of the bow law
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
commission for
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
any software changes that would be made
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
that would allow the machine to do that
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
i would add though that some towns have
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually removed the diverter
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me from the machine because of
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
jamming issues that
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know have occurred in the past
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
especially when there are many folds
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
on the longer ballots it was uh
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
the diverter actually caused jams that
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
was frustrating to some
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
communities and so the diverters have
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
been removed and then
 
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.630 align:start position:0%
been removed and then
the

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
the moderator and the election officials
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
would go through all of the ballots
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
looking for write-in votes
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
afterwards so
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
the shorter answer is that what you
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
described could be done um but i think
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
we ought to give some thought to
 
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.789 align:start position:0%
we ought to give some thought to
uh

00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
how that would occur
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
and uh just make sure we're as efficient
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
i have a couple in regards to
 
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.670 align:start position:0%
i have a couple in regards to
representative

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
the representative's question
 
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.829 align:start position:0%
the representative's question
um

00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that there are some
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
ballots particularly in local elections
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
that have races with no
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
candidate and that they are only
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
write-in candidates
 
00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.670 align:start position:0%
write-in candidates
ultimately

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.549 align:start position:0%
ultimately
yes

00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
okay so in that case when you had a race
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
that nobody had signed up before the
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
deadline but people were waging writing
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
campaigns it means all of those ballots
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
under that proposal would have to be
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
counted in their entirety correct
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
yes okay and when you talk about an
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
auxiliary i sort of felt like i should
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about a diverter
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
right now when it goes into the diverter
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
no one sees it right it's just going
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
most people don't even know such a thing
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
is occurring within the confines of the
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
plastic bin underneath the tabulator
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
so when you
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about an auxiliary
 
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.309 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about an auxiliary
bin

00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
bin
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the voter actually
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
placing it in it but i'm assuming we're
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
talking about something more than a open
 
00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.109 align:start position:0%
talking about something more than a open
paper

00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
box right i mean do you envision the
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:40.470 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
um

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
specific guidelines on what this
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
auxiliary container should be and given
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
what's happened in the last election
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
really really really specific guidelines
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
as to what the auxiliary
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
box should be
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes and my understanding is that there
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
is a third
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
auxiliary bin actually in the box under
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
the acuvo machine so
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the past if a ballot
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh is not read by the machine either the
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
corner is ripped right
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
that ballot gets rejected the moderator
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
takes it and puts it in a side auxiliary
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
slot right but we're already using the
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
axillary slots we're i mean i don't
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
how are we gonna we need another one
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
right well i don't know that we would
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
need another one because the ballot that
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
the moderator is currently putting in
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
that box needs to be counted in its
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
entirety and and so the same would be
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
true of an overvote ballot that's
 
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.630 align:start position:0%
true of an overvote ballot that's
rejected

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
rejected
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
going into the same
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
compartment all right then i have a
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
further question in regards to section
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
two which you spoke to nobody else had
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
spoken to
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
i had circled for each
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
election the number of overvoted ballots
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
so can the machines be programmed to not
 
00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:50.950 align:start position:0%
so can the machines be programmed to not
only

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
say it's an overvoted ballot but to
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
count it and here's my question
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
and i believe the former secretary would
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
say maybe i purposely overvoted but
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
when i put it in it's going to reject it
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to get told by the person
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
watching the machines to just put it in
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
again because sometimes it's just not at
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
the right angle it doesn't like at that
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
moment and maybe after two or three
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
times it's going to take it
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
at that point the tabulator has now
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
counted my ballot as a cash ballot
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
so when i put in
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
my overvoted ballot
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
and it's kicking it back out
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
how am i going to program that machine
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
to count that ballot as distinguished
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
from any other ballot because it's not
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
counting it when it's going in and being
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
rejected now it's doing the same thing
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
it i could do two overvotes and have the
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
next person put in a ballot that has two
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
over votes
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
and would the machine count that as one
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
ballot or
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
two ballots
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason i'm asking is
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
because of the question of tie outs and
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
legitimacy and i'm i'm worried about
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
an obvious mathematical problem that
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
will just create issues in regards to
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
the tabulation that's done after the
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
polls close yeah madam chair i i think
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
that i'm probably not the best person to
 
01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.630 align:start position:0%
that i'm probably not the best person to
answer

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
that question you know it might be worth
 
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.670 align:start position:0%
that question you know it might be worth
getting

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.789 align:start position:0%
getting
uh

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from lhs associates who
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
actually does the programming
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
to answer you know how that machine
 
01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.390 align:start position:0%
to answer you know how that machine
might

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
actually read the ballot that gets
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
rejected and my understanding is that if
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
it's an overvote
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh if it's programmed to reject an
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
overvote that the machine is just not
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to read that ballot
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
if if it gets spit back out but if it if
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
it goes through
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
it has probably recorded something
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
which is how you get a blank tally but
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
so my question is how do you get an
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
accurate overvote tally
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's essentially the basis of my
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
question if the tabulator is never
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
essentially turning on
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
to tabulate
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
how does it count again because you
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
could have successive
 
01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
could have successive
different

01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.030 align:start position:0%
different
overvoted

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
overvoted
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
ballots okay so
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna need an answer to that
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
question i think before if anybody's
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
listening and knows lhs and
 
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.270 align:start position:0%
listening and knows lhs and
representative

01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
with the committee so yeah um let let's
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
get through
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon we have one more speaker
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let you follow up with it
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative terozian
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
deputy speaker
 
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.150 align:start position:0%
deputy speaker
secretary

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
scanlan taking the question
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i want to be sure i'm clear now on
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
how this works with a diverter so right
 
01:01:45.599 --> 01:01:46.390 align:start position:0%
how this works with a diverter so right
now

01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
the way it's used if there's a
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
ballot that has a right in that goes
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
into that diverter box that's what goes
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
in there yes
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh does any other ballet go into that
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
diverter box currently
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
no the diverter would be to separate
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
ballots that have right in votes on them
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
follow up so if we were to adopt this
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment then if i'm hearing correctly
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
um then the
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
overvoted ballots would then go in there
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
or no they'd still
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
kick out and be not counted
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
they would be they would be kicked out
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
not counted and then the ballot would be
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
placed in a separate auxiliary box
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh under the device so that the the
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
entire ballot could be counted
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh after the polls close
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative alexander um thank you
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
madam chair um my concern with this um
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill the original version without the
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is section two with the
 
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.630 align:start position:0%
amendment is section two with the
um

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
for each contest or ballot question the
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
number overvotes and under votes um i
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
could conceivably see a reason
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
specifically in a primary or another
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
race where a voter might not want to
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
vote for the total number of people
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to vote for um you know
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
for instance in goffstown maybe i just
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
want to vote for madam chair and myself
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
and leave the other three blank so my
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
question is would the
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
are you advocating to remove
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
section 2 entirely from the bill because
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
it adds in the overvotes and undervotes
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
or how would you
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
how would you want that amended
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
no i would leave section 2 in i would
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
i don't have any questions oh i saw i'm
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
trying to be alert to red lights because
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
i'm missing hands
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien thank
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you for answering these
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i found
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm glad that you addressed the uh
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
hava act issues
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
would this need to be approved by the
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
after if it were
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
voted in favor of um because it would
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
require some
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
software changes is that true
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
the the statute would trump
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
the batlock commission
 
01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.069 align:start position:0%
the batlock commission
however

01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
to the extent that software
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
changes would be required the ballot law
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
further questions for secretary scanlan
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you thank you
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
representative porter did you want to
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
come up and clarify because i know
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
you're in the middle of another
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i appreciate
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
your concern um there seems to be an
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
issue with an amendment
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment that
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
um i presented is the amendment
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
amendments the one that the secretary of
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
state just gave you and the one that i
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
gave you is that we had eliminated the
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
words election day
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
on line seven
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
and we decided i decided i didn't want
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
to do that so the second amendment that
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
the um is not the one we wanted we
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
wanted the one ending in 4-1
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
that one the committee has the one the
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
commit that i handed out to the
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
committee the second issue about can it
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
can the ballots
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
can the machines count over votes and
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
under votes
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
if they don't accept the ballot and
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 sure on this but i have seen
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
pages from the secretary of state's
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
office from the state of vermont who
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
uses the same machines we do and it's
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
programmed by the same people and they
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
show for each election
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
the number of overvotes and the number
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
of undervotes
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
so it is possible to get a count of the
 
01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:47.750 align:start position:0%
so it is possible to get a count of the
overvotes

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
overvotes
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
without counting the ballots because
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
they use a process where the
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
the voter is given a chance to fix it or
 
01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:55.750 align:start position:0%
the voter is given a chance to fix it or
not

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
um and they use it the process that the
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
original bill set up
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
so they were able to uh to keep account
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
of overvotes and undervotes
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:07.430 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
porter

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
name is daniel healey i'm the derry town
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
clerk representing our town clerk
 
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.309 align:start position:0%
clerk representing our town clerk
association

01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
last year uh similar bill uh our
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
association opposed it um we're changing
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
our stance this year uh we're in support
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.549 align:start position:0%
of this bill
after

01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh what took place in wyndham uh we
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
recognize that it won't uh cure all of
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
the issues with the folds in the various
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
was found out
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
if you undervote and there's a fold the
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
machine it's not going to kick out
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
there's no overvote so it doesn't solve
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
everything but i think it's a step in
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
the right direction to to solve some of
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
the issues that were discovered
 
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.230 align:start position:0%
the issues that were discovered
um

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
to the issue that was just brought up i
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
believe if a ballot goes into a machine
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
and the machine it doesn't go fully
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
through the machine it's not going to
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
count on the tally tape so when it's put
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
in the side auxiliary pocket
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
the moderator and their staff at the end
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the night would take a tally of how
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
many ballots they pulled out of the
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
auxiliary pocket to to get your totals
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
for the ballots through
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't believe unless if it
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through the machine i don't
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
it adds another ballot i don't think it
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
does another count for it right but you
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
understand if i have two successive
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
voters who have each
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
overvoted yeah
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
then the machine
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
i i've got i'm gonna i'm gonna have to
 
01:07:55.599 --> 01:07:55.829 align:start position:0%
i i've got i'm gonna i'm gonna have to
i contact

01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
i contact
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
know how the machine would differentiate
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
that unless it was counting the ballot
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
to know that the votes on other races
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
were different
 
01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.430 align:start position:0%
were different
okay

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
from what i understand it doesn't count
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
anything until it determines all of the
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
races have either been over voted or
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
underwritten i see mary tell me maybe
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
you can catch me at the break ms till if

if you've got an answer to that
 
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.749 align:start position:0%

represent

01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you mr
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
hilly for taking my question
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
do i understand correctly from what
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
the machine would not count the
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
overvotes the overvote ballots would be
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
counted manually at the end of the night
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
so right now the machine would would
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
take the ballot and it um on our long
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
report it states the number of overvotes
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom of the tape right now
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
it would take the ballot and it it would
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
count it as a ballot cast i believe that
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
was turned on and so it kicked the
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
ballot out i don't believe that it would
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
then count it as a cast ballot if it's
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
with with that amendment i do have
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
i do like the amendment but i do have a
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
concern i mean i don't want to be
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
telling the voter oh just put it in the
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
side pocket when we know it's an
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
overvote and they're giving the ballot
 
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.910 align:start position:0%
overvote and they're giving the ballot
back

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.950 align:start position:0%
back
and

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
we can see that it's an overvote and i
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to just say oh well there's
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know put it in the side pocket
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
because the machine's not counting it so
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
i do have a concern with that that we're
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
not really telling the voter all the
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
information that we know
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
that that their ballot um yeah but
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
theoretically you shouldn't have even
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
looked at that ballot to know well we
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
want to be looking at the ballot it
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
display which theoretically frankly
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
should be i've got an issue with how
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
close people stand to that machine
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
anyways so you're close enough to be
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
reading that you can see the ballot well
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
typically the moderator would be behind
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
the ballot box
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
well okay that's a discussion for
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
another day as to this bill and the
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
amendment because we are behind folks uh
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.669 align:start position:0%
 
would

01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
you have to tell the voter
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh you have an overvote situation
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
and but at that same time you're not
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
able to tell them in what race there's
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
an overvote situation so
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
would they want to look at the ballot
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
with you how do you preserve the voter
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
privacy during this whole
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
situation that's my i believe that was
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
that that's the issue with the original
 
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.470 align:start position:0%
that that's the issue with the original
bill

01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
is that then it's become less
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
confidential so the amendment that was
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
presented would then so you put the
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
ballot in the auxiliary pocket and
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
and the um the election workers would
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
i did want to mention uh something that
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
i heard earlier with the derry over
 
01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:49.510 align:start position:0%
i heard earlier with the derry over
votes

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
we had a few residents come to us with
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
with that concern we had one very
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
popular undeclared voter so we had 21
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
candidates for state rep
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
choose 10 in three columns and i mean
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
there's no way for us to know this for
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
sure but
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
our assumption is that a lot of people
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
voted for 10
 
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.470 align:start position:0%
voted for 10
between

01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
either 10 democrats 10 republicans and
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
they filled in that bubble for the one
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
very popular undeclared voter so i don't
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
believe that derry really had an issue a
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
huge issue with the
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
the overvotes in the election
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative quailey
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chairman thank you
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh you said your organization now favors
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
as opposed to last year
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
do you favor the bill as
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
originally introduced do you or do you
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
favor it as amended or both or can you
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
explain to me any distinction you're
 
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.669 align:start position:0%
explain to me any distinction you're
making

01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
so i can't speak on the amendment for
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
our association um i can only speak to
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
the original bill that we're in favor of
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
um we believe that
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
something there needs to be some type of
 
01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
something there needs to be some type of
change

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
because of what happened in windham
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
this would probably solve about 75
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
percent of of that issue
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
if the overvotes were turned on at the
 
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.390 align:start position:0%
if the overvotes were turned on at the
time

01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
chairman as madam chairman said i'm not
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
a sponsor of this amendment
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
but i am introducing it
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
as we said when we amended csr 15 the
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
first time the point of this amendment
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
is to begin to end the debate
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
over who is voting in new hampshire's
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
elections is it residents is it
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
domiciles is it citizens of the state so
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment attempts to address that
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
as i will be asking questions on the
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
amendment itself i will not be taking
 
01:14:35.199 --> 01:14:37.830 align:start position:0%
amendment itself i will not be taking
questions

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
any further discussion thank you
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of people
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
signed up on this amendment
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is michael o'brien
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of america votes i am a
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
lobbyist at pretty strategies
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
um here opposed to the bill uh first a
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons a few reasons really
 
01:15:12.239 --> 01:15:13.590 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons a few reasons really
but

01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
for one on line 15
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
domiciled and life insists has primary
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
resonance a term that i do not believe
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
is defined within statute so we're sort
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
of putting words in the constitution
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
that have no meaning uh as to what they
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
actually mean um which is certainly
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
problematic um you already need to be a
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
citizen in the united states to vote um
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship is one of the things that is
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
asked for qualifications um so again i'm
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh the additional wording is necessary
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
there um also you need to be a resident
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the state to vote in new hampshire
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
right with the whole purpose of 1264 a
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
few years ago which was hotly debated
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
within these exact walls maybe there was
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
a wall in between but just about the
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
exact walls
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
was to equate the definition of
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
residency and domicile
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so again i feel like we're searching
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
for a solution to a problem here and
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
lastly i think there's a lot of
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
conversations in this room about making
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
sure people have faith in our election
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
systems and their processes and i agree
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
with that um but i do think also that
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
every time that we bring in a bill that
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
purports to solve a big problem with
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
people voting who aren't residents and
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
storming into our elections we are
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
pushing that narrative that people
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
should be afraid of our elections
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh when we all have seen the comments
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
from the governor from the previous
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state the current secretary
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
of state many of you around this
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
committee have said
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
that we should have faith in our
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
elections that we should have trust in
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
our elections
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to push that message as
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to this one that we're pushing
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
through this bill people would have
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
faith in our elections it is up to us
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
and to you all as elected officials to
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
let people know
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
that they should have faith in the
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
elections um and to not create
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
narratives that would suggest otherwise
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that is my testimony i'm happy to
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr o'brien questions
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative growing thank you madam
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you mr o'brien um
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned um hb 1264 that helped
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
further define
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
residency domicile issues
 
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.390 align:start position:0%
residency domicile issues
um

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
i would assume you're aware
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
that has been a hotly debated issue for
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
many years many decades
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
and that definition has changed many
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
times i'm aware i've i've been in this
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
room for about 10 of them so uh i
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
understand yes sir and follow-up manager
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
you're also aware that this is not a
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
bill it's a cacr
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
i am aware to see acr um i don't think
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
the csr is necessary
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up please
 
01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.470 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up please
um

01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
since we have seen this issue argued
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
back and forth and changed back and
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
forth and back and forth would it not be
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate to
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
put in our constitution what we mean by
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
residency and domicile so that the
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislature can stop dealing with it
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's in the constitution primary
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
residence is not defined so it's an
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
undefined term so you're putting an
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
undefined term in the constitution which
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure helps anybody solve a
 
01:18:14.159 --> 01:18:15.750 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure helps anybody solve a
problem

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
but residents are the folks voting in
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire elections
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
if people
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
again if we stopped saying otherwise
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
people would have faith in our elections
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
we have to stop reporting a narrative
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative barry um so i want to
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
talk about i want to ask you a question
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
about um
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
you say residency is not defined
 
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.189 align:start position:0%
you say residency is not defined
but

01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
sorry representing primary resonance is
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
not defined primary but isn't primary in
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
itself an adjective describing like it's
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
saying primary the the number one that's
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's literally a description
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm i i might defer to madam chair
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
here because she's a lawyer and i am not
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
but at private residence i believe is it
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
would be could be a separate term with
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
separate meeting and i think we'd have
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
to be very careful with that before we
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
put it i will just interject that as an
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
attorney i could carry things to no end
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
and there is a practice attorneys are
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
aware of when you ask questions that you
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
provide the definition
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
and there was once joking god that the
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
definition of thee
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
is because you can define
 
01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.310 align:start position:0%
is because you can define
everything

01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
so representative barry and in your
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
testimony you talked about you know once
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
again i'm going back to the definition
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
of residency here but we we do have
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
definitions of resonant in statute not
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
in the constitution but in statute um
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
and part of that is how long you've
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
lived in the state so
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
my question is is since this is dealing
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
with residency and residence is defined
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
in statute how long does your
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
organization believe you should have to
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
live in the state of new hampshire
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
before you can vote here
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
sure so um
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
i think the answer to that in my history
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
with america votes both as an employee
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
and now as as someone who represents
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
them here
 
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.229 align:start position:0%
them here
um

01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
the constitution is very clear both the
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
u.s and new hampshire once you move here
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
and becomes your home you are allowed to
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
vote here right so
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
if we started requiring could you before
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
you proceed could you please define home
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
sure so now we're going to go into the
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
definition of domicile which i think is
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
the place where you
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
you know where you spend where you
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
identify as your
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
civic engagement right so
 
01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.709 align:start position:0%
civic engagement right so
um

01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
i i would have to go back and i'm going
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
to get definitions to get myself in
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
trouble and i'd rather not do that
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
as much as possible though i seem to do
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
that more with more kids than i used to
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
um but to say this that
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
if we were to start putting we've seen
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
bills in the legislature before about 30
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
days before someone can
 
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.629 align:start position:0%
days before someone can
um

01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know can cast a ballot here
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
um you're going to start finding people
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
exclusions right so i move out before of
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
a state within 30 days of elections i
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
get here i can vote in federal elections
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
but i can't vote in state elections so
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
i've lost my voice in a state election
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the place where you
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
live where you consider your home i'll
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
where you have
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
an address that you would go to over and
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
over and over again
 
01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:08.790 align:start position:0%
over and over again
um

01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
this is where you should vote and i
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
further questions representative barry
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
so i just want to follow up my previous
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
question because my previous question
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
was how long do you does your
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
organization believe you should have to
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
live in the state of new hampshire
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
before you can vote here
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
effectively you said
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
so if i move here on election day
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
and i have bought a house on november
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
7th i don't actually know what day
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
election day is next this year
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
november 8th
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
whatever i knew would be around there i
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure exactly the day right um i
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
guess the counterpoint to that would be
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
should i if i own it
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
i moved on my furniture and i own this
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
home it's election day should i not vote
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
here do i not have the obligation to the
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire where i am
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
committing myself to be
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
why are we telling people this is the
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
place where you're moving to this is the
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
place where you're committing to but
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're not quite going to let you vote
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
here yet
 
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.750 align:start position:0%
here yet
um

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
we have the this idea and i know what
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
you're going at here this idea that of
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
the person who stays in the motel for
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
five minutes and goes back
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
is breaking the law let's be very clear
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
about that that is breaking the
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
definition of domicile it is breaking
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
the definition of resident under 1264
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
and 235
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
acceptable in new hampshire practice
 
01:22:35.679 --> 01:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
acceptable in new hampshire practice
however

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
me moving into an apartment or a home
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
on the day of election day
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm super dry so i apologize for the
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
sound here but is accepted practice and
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
should be because otherwise you're
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
telling people who have committed to new
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire you're saying
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
great you've committed here but you're
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to wait two years before
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
you can cast a ballot and i would argue
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that is problematic as well
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
further questions representative sweeney
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
you had stated
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
that we currently require someone to be
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
a citizen united states in order to vote
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
during your testimony and i was
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if you or your organization
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
are aware
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
in vermont there are a few
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities in new york city
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
they've recently opened up municipal
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
elections to non-citizen voting
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
would this this would prohibit such a
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
move by any municipality in the same new
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire would it not
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's i believe already printed in new
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire which is where we're talking
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
about the law is written so
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm just saying this would enshrine
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
in the state's constitution it would but
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's not i do not believe necessary
 
01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:41.669 align:start position:0%
it's not i do not believe necessary
still

01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative growing
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question if
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
going back to the primary residence
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
issue if you take primary at face value
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's the main place that you live
 
01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.950 align:start position:0%
it's it's the main place that you live
uh

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
would you agree that
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
for somebody to vote in new hampshire
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
that should be descriptive of their
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
right to vote that it is their primary
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
residence and i think it already is yes
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
you think that's a ready follow-up madam
 
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.070 align:start position:0%
you think that's a ready follow-up madam
chair

01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
you think that's already in statute in
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i think that for folks who
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
are voting in new hampshire it is their
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
primary residence
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
whatever that i suppose means in statute
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
in colloquial terms yes
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney thank you thank
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
you again for indulging us
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
so what i've gathered from your
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
testimony in the answers to the
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions is there's nothing
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
technically new in this constitutional
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that differs from existing
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
state statute in your opinion
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
well again it depends i guess the
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
definition of primary residences um
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're adding i'm not sure
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
a citizen of the state of new hampshire
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
what that's going to mean for voters who
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
show up are we going to have to
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
i don't really know what else we'd have
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
to prove besides
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
how you become a citizen of the state of
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is that just my lease or
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
is that some other document unclear to
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
me on what that means
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
but i think i'm objecting to also to the
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
principle here which is to say that
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
these kind of things
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh seem to suggest that there is a
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
problem with new hampshire elections and
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
i veemingly disagree with that i'll also
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
say that after the senate passed this
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
exact same language i got more than one
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
fundraising email talking about how
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
great it was that they were passing this
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh so i think there are you know i think
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
we gotta focus on issues that
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
should be focused on follow-up madam
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
chair follow-up thank you thank you
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
again um
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
i just think if if
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes my question is if our elections are
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
great in new hampshire which i believe
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
they are should we not enshrine what
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
current state statute has for our
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
elections in our constitution so they
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
can remain great for the foreseeable
 
01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
can remain great for the foreseeable
future

01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
i would say they are going to remain
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
great for the foreseeable future there
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
is nothing that has been presented to me
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
to suggest otherwise right we are doing
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
it well in fact i would say that the
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
elections that we ran during the
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic through the hard work of our
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
local election officials were some of
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
the most successful elections that we
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
had seen
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
and so again it's this idea that there
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
is something wrong
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
with our elections that we need to do
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
something to fix them when we do not and
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
see none thank you thank you
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
go get a drink of water
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
all right uh let's also sign up to speak
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative horgan do
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
you want to go
 
01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
you want to go
sorry

01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
i missed you
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
oh that that's okay man i'm cheering
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize you came back in i'm
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
actually glad uh i'm actually glad uh
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
former mr o'brien uh he was a
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
distinguished former member of our
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
caucus of the uh speaker's staff um was
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
able to speak first because he asked a
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
lot of uh
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
tough tough questions and i'm not sure
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
whether my intellect is a match for the
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
especially with the two members in the
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
corner but i'll do my best and i will
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
explain why i think this memo is a bad
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
idea so first of all i'll just say
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
parenthetically the underlying bill or
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
resolution whatever you want to call it
 
01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.669 align:start position:0%
resolution whatever you want to call it
um

01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
is a good idea but um
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
and that's uh but i didn't show up for
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
that hearing so that that's not what
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today so the
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed non-germain amendment is
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
identical to senate bill cacr 36 which
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
will go to the floor actually tomorrow
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
thursday february 24th
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
with a three to two ought to pass
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation and i'm pretty sure that
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
was a party line vote
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
which leads to my
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
while it's only a rule in the chamber
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily in in our chain
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
i try not to talk about the other body
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
okay i just want to say it's unnecessary
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's in another body uh this proposal is
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
already you know going through the
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislative process and
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
it will
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
if it gets through the other body we're
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
not allowed to mention it will
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
eventually uh be here presumably be
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
referred to your committee the exact
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
wording right down to the uh right down
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
to the the commas and periods and
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
everything so it's it's exactly the same
 
01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:32.390 align:start position:0%
everything so it's it's exactly the same
as

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
as
another

01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
resolution in another body and um
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
so i kind of feel like
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
just bringing it up here
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
so it's first of all it's it's just a
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
waste of time and effort you know we're
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
all we may already have our chance at
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
doing it so
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
my second objection is that's a bad idea
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
essentially as the phrase and his
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
primary residency to existing
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional language which states
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
that voters must be domiciled in the
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
town ward or unincorporated place where
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
they vote and i'm
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
like mr o'brien i'm really not sure what
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
that phrase primary residency means
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
and it's also unclear to me even a
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
primary residency means something
 
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.030 align:start position:0%
primary residency means something
i'm

01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
not sure why a person is domiciled in
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
particular place in new hampshire should
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
be disqualified from voting simply
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
because his or her residency is not
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
quote unquote primary whatever that
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
adjective is construed to mean
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
so it definitely seems to me that there
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
would be some cases where individuals
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
could now be totally disqualified from
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
voting anywhere at all if you're
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
domiciled in one place but you have your
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
primary residence somewhere else and i'm
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
assuming the term primary residence
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
actually means something other than
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
domicile but you're theoretically be
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
disqualified from voting in either place
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
unless of course as i said the term
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
primary residents construe they have no
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
meaning at all other than the place for
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
your domicile in which case this whole
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is on is uh unnecessary and
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'm also concerned about
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
student voting um in my
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony i talked about what uh
 
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.470 align:start position:0%
written testimony i talked about what uh
a

01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
member actually if this body said to the
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
other body and i guess that's kind of uh
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's not allowed not allowed here so i
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
respect that but it definitely um
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
i think it's perceived by me and i think
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
my perception is accurate that it's uh
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
at least in part
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
would prevent so-called out-of-state
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
college students from voting in new
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i think there was uh
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
but the us constitution federal voting
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
rights on and they're just plain simple
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
common sense i'll stipulate that college
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
students must be allowed to vote in the
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
place where they actually live nine to
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
12 months out of the year
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
on the end of those i said before it's
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
unclear what meaning can or will be
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
ascribed to the highly ambiguous phrase
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
thomas out in and has primary residence
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the town ward or incorporated place
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
that the so-called in-state students
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
will be in-state students which is um
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
actually most of the i believe that's
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of most of the students
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
attending colleges here in new hampshire
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
unh unh i know it's about 50 50. the
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
community college system is like 95
 
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.990 align:start position:0%
community college system is like 95
percent

01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
95 percent in state students and
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
dartmouth has a significant percentage
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire residents and i'm not
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
sure about the others but i'm fairly
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
safe to say that a majority of the
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
college students at the colleges
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire are in fact
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
living in new hampshire before they move
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere to go to school
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me they would be deemed
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
ineligible to vote in the place they
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
lived before going to college because
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
either that place they live before
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
supposedly if you think it's still their
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
primary residence and i really think
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's probably like why um the sponsors
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
in the other body introduce this and um
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's things possibly they wouldn't be
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
able to vote in either place and you
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
also you can't come to the out of state
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
students actually being allowed to vote
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
in the previous state that they lived in
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
many cases have good reasons to want to
 
01:31:52.159 --> 01:31:53.030 align:start position:0%
many cases have good reasons to want to
vote

01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire rather than their
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
old state that they've left behind and
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
something else to say about college
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
students is they often stay for many
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
many years after they graduate one of
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
stratford county six delegation and i
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
probably i think i forgot to say at the
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
beginning that i'm representing timothy
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
horrigan they all knew that i'm from
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
stratfor county six the towns of durham
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
and madbury but at least one of the
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
state reps from my delegation
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
moved here from another state in the
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
1970s has lived in durham continuously
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
since since so they don't all just go
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
away as soon as they graduate and i know
 
01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:26.470 align:start position:0%
away as soon as they graduate and i know
um

01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
so anyways i think uh
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's not a good idea from um
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
so there's definitely is at least the
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
possibility to disenfranchise both
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
out-of-state college students and
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
in-state college students i don't think
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
either of those are good policy and
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
probably unconstitutional and violate
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.470 align:start position:0%
federal law
finally

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
something is
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
less ambiguous
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming it turns out to mean
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
what the proponents apparently wanted to
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
mean of course which is a whole question
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
there it's a very um we're totally
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised so-called you acaba
 
01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.750 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised so-called you acaba
voters

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlan is not here by do you
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
see deputy
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary lovejoy she probably
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
knows a lot more about it than i do but
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
those are u.s citizens who reside
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
overseas put in title to vote for
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
federal office and the last place they
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
lived before moving out of the united
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
states usually they fill out a
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
shortened version of the absentee ballot
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
because here in new hampshire you can
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
only vote for the federal offices some
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
states do let you vote for the state
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
offices and
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
i suppose the yuakov voter could
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
theoretically fly back to new hampshire
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
and vote in their old hometown and then
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
fly back to where they live but
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
so that's definitely
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's not even ambiguous in my mind
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
i've looked at the yo kava law on the
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines so that's uh a direct
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
one amendment can't be unconstitutional
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
but it can definitely conflict with
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
federal law and we we would have like a
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
pretty um
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
yeah we hate to be sued we probably
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
would be sued if we if this amendment
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
was became part of the constitution
 
01:33:57.199 --> 01:33:57.610 align:start position:0%
was became part of the constitution
and

01:33:57.610 --> 01:33:57.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.110 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
so finally my third objection
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
is that it's an insult to the sponsors
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
the underlying version of cacf r15 who
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
are trying to encourage young people to
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
vote by allowing 17 year olds to vote in
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
the primary election if they will be 18
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
by the day of the general election
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
so i will close by quoting what one of
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
cfr 15 sponsors my friend and colleague
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative sherry frost said to me
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
when i asked her about this amendment
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
and she specifically uh
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
she specifically authorized me to quote
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
her she responded simply quote ugg so
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
this is this is definitely it's like i'm
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
i believe probably the other uh
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
sponsored vision will probably feel the
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
same way they might not have expressed
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
themselves quite bluntly but you know
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know oh it's definitely um
 
01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
you know oh it's definitely um
it's

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
definitely um not in not in line with
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
the spirit of the original bill and we i
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
mean we do non-germane amendments that
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
reverse the attend the original bill all
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
the time and even germain amendments but
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
still it's it's not a good legislative
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
practice and it should be avoided and
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
frankly it's uh
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's an insult to the members who worked
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
hard to bring the original uh resolution
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward so with um
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
so that i think it's pretty clear that
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
this bill should be itl i'd be happy to
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horrigan
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative sweeney thank
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
the first part of your testimony and the
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
the crux of the previous speaker's
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
testimony in my opinion uh was that this
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is enshrining
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
current practice and state statute into
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
our state's constitution we had record
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
turnout in 2020 under your perception
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
that you got to in the second half of
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
how many people do you think that were
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote in 2020 under the state
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
statutes that were enshrining in our
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
constitution would now somehow not be
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote in future elections
 
01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.350 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote in future elections
my

01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
my guess is if you share my
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the language it's zero
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
but obviously this has been introduced
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
for some reason to correct some problem
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps i'm guessing wrong what it is so
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's obvious
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so i
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
it depends on
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
it depends on how it's construed and
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
what sort of law is uh you know probably
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
some statute law would be passed in
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
response to it of course this doesn't
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
kick in until 2024 anyways i mean
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you do it really really literally in
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
domicile is the same thing as primary
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
residents and so uh this bill's total
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know this resolution is totally
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so there's no point you know
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's no point in reword just
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
rewording it in a way that's less clear
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
so follow up madam chair thank you
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
follow up so to just to first distinct
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
answer zero voters would be
 
01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.109 align:start position:0%
answer zero voters would be
disenfranchised

01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't hold me to it but i'm i'm
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
it will would
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
most likely be zero but i i don't want
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
to take a chance on it it could be you
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
know it could be thousands of them
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
depending on uh
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.239 --> 01:36:59.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you um madam chairman uh
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um you
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned college students in your
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
testimony where in the bill does it
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i can't refer to the
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
debate in the other body so that issue
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
came up in the cas 36 debate but that's
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
not an issue here but that was about a
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
amendment a resolution that's exactly
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
right down to every comma
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
every dot over every i every cross over
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
every t so it's exactly identical to
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
that resolution which will be voted on
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
in another legislative body tomorrow and
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
certainly with that one
 
01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.390 align:start position:0%
certainly with that one
um

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
i just know that i just know it's a
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
controversial issue and it did it did
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
come up in another legislative body
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horrigan
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.390 align:start position:0%
further questions
um

01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
yes one representative um you mentioned
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
let's not talk about college students
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
for a second let's talk about people who
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
spend nine out of the 12 months here in
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire effectively by your
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
admission having primary residency in
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
the state which
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
is a tacit admission about how that
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
there is some length of time you should
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
live here before you vote here um but
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that aside
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
my my question is is
 
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
is if if these people who are spending
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
the majority of their time here
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
and are voting here and nobody's
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
disputing as you're not disputing and
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not disputing they have a right to
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
vote here shouldn't they be doing the
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
other things that new hampshire
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
residents do like getting a new
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license with your
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
correct address on it registering your
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
car here in new hampshire shouldn't
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
residents of the state who are voting in
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire elections be doing the
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
things that every other resident does
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
and if they're not
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
what makes these people special to not
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
have to do these things that other
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
residents are doing
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
well those um those two things you
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned are very very minor motor
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle violations they're not they're
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
not felonies and um
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm probably this is a topic
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
which actually was the subject of
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
another uh another piece of legislation
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
just yesterday but um
 
01:38:58.800 --> 01:38:59.510 align:start position:0%
just yesterday but um
the

01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the driver's license we were
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
part of a uh
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
we're part of a compact with every other
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
state and we have reciprocal agreements
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
with every other state and actually all
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
the canadian provinces that
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
one jurisdiction's driver's license is
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
as good as another for the purposes of
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh identificat of a
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
proving well first of all that you're a
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
qualified driver and that you have uh
 
01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.830 align:start position:0%
qualified driver and that you have uh
you

01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
and that your identification so for that
 
01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.950 align:start position:0%
and that your identification so for that
regard

01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
regard
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
basically if you have a out of state
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license you're basically it's
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
as good as an in-state driver's license
 
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
you just have the old address on it and
 
01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:32.790 align:start position:0%
you just have the old address on it and
certainly

01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
certainly
um

01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know those are minor motor vehicle
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
violations and sometimes there are you
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
know especially with the car sometimes
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
the reasons why
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
a student in particular they're driving
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
a car that's owned by another family
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
member and it's difficult to register it
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
but that's that's an extremely minor
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle violation it's not a
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
felony it's not something that would
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
normally disqualify you to vote and
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
nobody would really care
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
nobody really cares if a unh student
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
registers to vote with their uh
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
safety move from to durham
 
01:40:02.639 --> 01:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
safety move from to durham
yeah

01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
as for the durational requirement i'm
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
i'm happy with the the current law so
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any other questions thank
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
you representative horrigan oh thank you
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
and uh signed up as the final speaker
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to speak
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
before you i'm liz tentarelli i'm
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
president of the nonpartisan league of
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
women voters
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
and our job is to help people understand
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
how they vote
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
i think most of the committee members
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
know how they want to vote on this i'm
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to try to amend the
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment in one way only
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
and that is get rid of the phrase a
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
citizen of new hampshire
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have a passport from new
 
01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.790 align:start position:0%
i don't have a passport from new
hampshire

01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
i was not born here i don't know how i'd
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
prove that i am a citizen of new
 
01:41:10.719 --> 01:41:12.310 align:start position:0%
prove that i am a citizen of new
hampshire

01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
so i got very annoyed sorry that's wrong
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
i was disturbed when i saw this
 
01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.070 align:start position:0%
i was disturbed when i saw this
amendment

01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
and i guess i had too much time on my
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
hands because i started googling through
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
the rsas
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
for citizen
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
and the only place i found citizen of
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
new citizen of new hampshire
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
was in some of the very very old parts
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
statutes that defined who may hold
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
certain offices
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
so this probably is a phrase that was
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
used back in the 1800s
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
it is not a phrase we use now
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
and if in my role with the league of
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
women voters i'm trying to explain to
 
01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.430 align:start position:0%
women voters i'm trying to explain to
people

01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
who may vote
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
i can easily explain citizen of the
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
united states people understand that you
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
were either born here or you were
 
01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.229 align:start position:0%
were either born here or you were
naturalized

01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
naturalized
 
01:42:10.239 --> 01:42:11.669 align:start position:0%
naturalized
citizen

01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to explain citizen of
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
and unless we're going to start issuing
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
passports i can't explain it
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
so please consider eliminating that
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
phrase which has essentially no meaning
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
for voting purposes
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
miss tentarelli um
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
does the term primary residence
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
give you any pause
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's a tough one to explain to people
 
01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.830 align:start position:0%
it's a tough one to explain to people
um

01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
we have used the word domiciled
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
and that too is confusing to many
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
would-be voters it's not a term we
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
commonly use
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
so when i try in the simplest language
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
possible to make voting accessible to
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
the most people
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
i say you need to offer some evidence of
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
where you live
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
and i leave it at that
 
01:43:18.159 --> 01:43:19.270 align:start position:0%
and i leave it at that
and

01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
i realize that's not what the statutes
 
01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.390 align:start position:0%
i realize that's not what the statutes
say

01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
but i have to work with people who need
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
to understand things so yeah primary
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
residence domicile
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
those may be legal terms
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
they're not very helpful to the average
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
person who now is eligible to vote
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative barry um yes thank you
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
madam chairman and
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
primary residency domicile
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
what do you think is more confusing
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
which one is more ambiguous do you
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
believe which one's which one's better
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that's a phrase that
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
people understand where you live yeah
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for this oh i'm sorry
 
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
further questions representative growing
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
so the proposed amendment here says that
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
a person
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
is a citizen of new hampshire
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
only if that person is domiciled in and
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
has primary residence in the town ward
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
an incorporated place
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
isn't that the definition of citizen of
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that you would be looking
 
01:44:31.679 --> 01:44:32.709 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that you would be looking
for

01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't this define it quite clearly
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a phrase that i've ever seen
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
before i've never been asked are you a
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
citizen of new hampshire
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
and i would guess most of the people in
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
this room have not been asked that
 
01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.430 align:start position:0%
this room have not been asked that
question

01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
you may have been asked where do you
 
01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:50.550 align:start position:0%
you may have been asked where do you
live

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
but you're not asked if you're a citizen
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire you're a citizen of the
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
united states i assume
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying where what is your
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
citizenship you say united states not
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
this committee to consider
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
making this language something that
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
makes sense to the vast majority of
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
people who are eligible to vote
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
but need to know that they are eligible
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
i will just point out that i think when
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
they did this the second or third time
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
which got us into this mess they thought
 
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
they were being perfectly clear then too
 
01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.390 align:start position:0%
they were being perfectly clear then too
so

01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions for liz tentarelli
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you you want
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
to press the button liz so the red is
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
off thanks
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative wayne um
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
i find myself in the awkward position
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
that we're not able
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
to uh
ask

01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
questions of the of you as the person
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
who put forth this amendment
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
is is that a procedural
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
you can go ahead okay
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
sorry i just just for purposes of
 
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
conducting the hearing i know i know i
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
understand okay representative barry
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
does that a lot
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we constantly putting people down
 
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:12.550 align:start position:0%
yeah we constantly putting people down
there

01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
there
okay

01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i would like to ask about these
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
phrases that um just that disturbed me
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
and caused me because i also looked at
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
primary residence as a
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
red flag
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
because it implies there is a secondary
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
residence and the term primary residence
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
is not defined in 1260 well i don't even
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
know the statute but the bill 1264 right
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
not not the one that we have to perforce
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
now but
 
01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.390 align:start position:0%
now but
so

01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do a constitutional
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
amendment i would like it to be
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
more clear than this language
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
some of this had to do with what what
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
you we just heard someone refer to as
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
being what people are comfortable with
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
and understand and so in the hope that
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
the adjective primary the use of it as
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
an adjective was going to clarify things
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
because we also have had discussions and
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
case law referring to people who have
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
multiple places where they lay their
 
01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.830 align:start position:0%
multiple places where they lay their
head

01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
head
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
the attempt was to distinguish that
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i think it's pretty clear by virtue
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
of the fact we've got some other bills
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
in front of us who actually talk about
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
nights of the year or something from a
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
time standpoint so that was the hope but
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
as we have public hearings we always
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
learn that things we think we're clear
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
and the citizen language
 
01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:41.510 align:start position:0%
and the citizen language
actually

01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
goes back to
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
comments that have been received or
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
discussed in regards to
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
the origins of it to begin with and that
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
there has been historical use of the
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
term citizen
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
and that it does have an historical
 
01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:58.709 align:start position:0%
and that it does have an historical
meaning

01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
and that maybe use of it in this
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
generation after hearing common is not
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate but that was the intent was
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
and i apologize to committee members for
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
that but i think we ask questions to
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead on the on the
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
question of new hampshire citizenship um
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's something i do take seriously
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
though i think of it as symbolic rather
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
than a legal thing
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if i if i could ask you
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
whether you agree with me in that
 
01:48:34.159 --> 01:48:35.189 align:start position:0%
whether you agree with me in that
respect

01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
i grew up in manchester new hampshire
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
and as a grown-up i um
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
i was compelled to live in texas for a
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
number of years in order to make a
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
living and although texas is a great
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
state it's not as great as the state of
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
so when i lived there i consider myself
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
a citizen of red sox nation
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
and refused to root for the rangers
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
the whole while i was there and i also
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
considered myself a citizen of new
 
01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.229 align:start position:0%
considered myself a citizen of new
hampshire

01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
even though i was residing in in texas
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think that was a fair thing
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
to do uh because it's a kind of state of
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
mind and a symbolic status and
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if you would agree that
 
01:49:14.159 --> 01:49:15.030 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if you would agree that
that

01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
category of citizenship of new hampshire
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
maintained that way as a
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
as a an allegiance and a state of mind
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
and a symbolic thing rather than a legal
 
01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:27.109 align:start position:0%
and a symbolic thing rather than a legal
thing

01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that would be my answer
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
more of a statement than a common chair
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
just want to say i agree with
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative meerhead as a native
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
texan i do agree that new hampshire is
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
do i get to add in i lived in houston i
 
01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:52.149 align:start position:0%

processes
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
um because we have some
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
communities with some
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%

looked at your calendar things need to
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%

02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
back here
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
we've gone through substitutes our first
 
02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.350 align:start position:0%
we've gone through substitutes our first
bill

02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the list to be exact this afternoon
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
is cacr 22
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
relating to elections providing that all
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
elections in new hampshire shall be by
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
rank choice voting i'm going to open up
 
02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
the discussion on that and include h.b
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
1264 for comments from committee members
 
02:11:23.669 --> 02:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
that is also a bill establishing rank
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
choice voting for state party primary
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
elections and municipal elections so
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
they are both dealing with ranked choice
 
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
voting we've already had one bill
 
02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:33.189 align:start position:0%
voting we've already had one bill
that

02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
went to session and was voted on last
 
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:36.870 align:start position:0%
went to session and was voted on last
week

02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
but these two are also ranked choice
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
voting they are doing something slightly
 
02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599 align:start position:0%
different and at this time before i take
 
02:11:43.599 --> 02:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
different and at this time before i take
any

02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:48.950 align:start position:0%
any
um

02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think it's any who's the
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
real parliamentary can i open discussion
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
without having a motion on the floor
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
i do not view myself as a
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian madam chair i think as
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
the chair you can issue whatever
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
procedures and rules you wish and unless
 
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
someone challenges you we're going to
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
abide by those all right i'm taking a
 
02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
look at those open windows
 
02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:12.310 align:start position:0%
look at those open windows
deciding

02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
deciding
 
02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:13.510 align:start position:0%
deciding
so

02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
before we have any emotion i am going to
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
open the floor for committee members to
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
discuss this
 
02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:22.310 align:start position:0%
discuss this
and

02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron has raised his
 
02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:25.830 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron has raised his
hand

02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
in regards to it so i'm going to
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
consider this time open for discussion
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
on both bills in regards to rank choice
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
voting representative bergeron thank you
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of set the table if
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
i might
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
i am going to vote against the cacr
 
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:47.109 align:start position:0%
i am going to vote against the cacr
22

02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
22
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think a constitutional amendment
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
is needed at this time
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's unnecessary i think that
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
language could be written and submitted
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
in fact has been
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
to create rank choice voting situations
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
in state law
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not necessary to
 
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
tamper with the constitution to direct
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
that the shall occur
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1264 however that's
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
primarily enabling legislation and if
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity arises i would like to
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
submit an amendment to that
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh which would address some of the
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
issues i had with house bill 1264
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
initially uh particularly dealing with
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
the process by which uh
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
the political parties and municipalities
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
could choose to use rank choice voting
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
in their particular arenas and also to
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
there was a way to rescind that action
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
at a future point in time if they
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
decided well after all ranked choice
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
voting really wasn't working for us and
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
would like to uh
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
would like to go back to the way things
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
used to be so
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
that's just in an effort to set the
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
table for discussion if if i may
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative barry yes i'm not going
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
to speak at length about this but to
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
address i disagree with the
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative from nashua's
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
response about cacr22 i think if you
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
were to implement ranked choice voting i
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
do actually think you would need a
 
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment um the state
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
constitution specifically outlines
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
plurality for certain state races
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
pluralities is
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
a power is pro plurality is what it
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
means which is the person who has the
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
most votes it's not majority plurality
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
is not majority so i do i do disagree i
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
mean we're going to vote the same way
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
but for different reasons but i just i
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave that on the table
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
that i actually think if you were to do
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
this for all races you would need a cacr
 
02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
this for all races you would need a cacr
okay

02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
come on
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who don't know she
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
didn't raise her hand but i know
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
how that she feels very strongly about
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill so
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me
 
02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm supporting i
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
would be voting against cacr22
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
but i am supporting
 
02:15:10.719 --> 02:15:13.270 align:start position:0%
but i am supporting
uh

02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
1264 1264.
 
02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:18.550 align:start position:0%
1264 1264.
um

02:15:18.550 --> 02:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
i believe that rank choice
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
voting makes election elections more
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative of the will of the people
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
than the first pass to post system that
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
it gives voters the freedom to vote
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
their conscience
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
it discourages negative campaigning
 
02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it helps to cure a divided society
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the main reason why
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
we need rank choice voting
 
02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:47.030 align:start position:0%
we need rank choice voting
um

02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
our country is divided uh
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
the partisanship has become hyper
 
02:15:52.639 --> 02:15:54.629 align:start position:0%
the partisanship has become hyper
partisan

02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
the gridlock in congress is
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
causing them to not be able to get
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
anything done
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of public distrust and
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
dis dissatisfaction of government
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
so rank choice voting
 
02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.149 align:start position:0%
so rank choice voting
would

02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
not necessarily solve all the problems
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
at once but it's a step in the right
 
02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:17.669 align:start position:0%
at once but it's a step in the right
direction

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:16:17.679 --> 02:16:18.390 align:start position:0%
direction
to

02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:20.229 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
it incentivizes candidates
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
to reach across the aisle and find
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
common ground and attract support from
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
more voters they need to get the
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
need to get you know over 50 of the vote
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
in order to win
 
02:16:35.599 --> 02:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
in order to win
um

02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
and the same as
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
so then if they're elected with over 50
 
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the book they have more support when
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
they're in office
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
and they have more reason to
 
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
reach across the aisle and try and work
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
out agreements with with other with
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
other other people
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting can help to cure a
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
divided society and i believe that
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
that's the main reason why we need to
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
and allow this opportunity to enable
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and the parties to
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
try it out if they choose to
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
representative terezian
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
i disagree as far as making um
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
negative campaigning um
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
less than what it is now and the reason
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
i say that
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
in a primary election
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh it's no secret that most candidates
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
if they're in a
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
a primary whether it's contested
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
the best way to win that primary is to
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
to to put forth a candidate who
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
relates with
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
party leaders in that in that
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
whatever whether it's a democrat or
 
02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:55.990 align:start position:0%
whatever whether it's a democrat or
republican

02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
republican
 
02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.190 align:start position:0%
republican
primary

02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
primary
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
and statistics bear that out um that the
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
four four and three four voters are the
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
most likely to go so if you want to win
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
that primary you're going to really
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
message to those folks
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
so on one hand you're going to be very
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
partisan but then in the general
 
02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:11.110 align:start position:0%
partisan but then in the general
election

02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
under ranked choice
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
neutral or in the middle of the road and
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
tell everybody what they want to hear
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean you're
 
02:18:22.309 --> 02:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to get a better candidate you're
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to get a candidate that tells you
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
what you want to hear more but that
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean that
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
that candidate is going to be a better
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
candidate i mean
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
let's face it look at the poll numbers
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
on politicians the average american
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't trust what they say anyway so i
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's going to really
 
02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:41.190 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's going to really
achieve

02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:41.990 align:start position:0%
achieve
that

02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
if it would i
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
would be in favor but this time i'm i'm
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron why don't you
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
take us through the amendment it's
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendment zero seven
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
six nine
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
this would amend section 11 of house
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
bill 1264
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
which in the original bill is titled
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
applicability this one the new title is
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
applicability and implementation
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
the major changes are
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
first of all as far as the party goes it
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that it's up to the
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
parties to decide uh how what process
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
they want to use to come to the decision
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
that they want to use ranked choice
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
voting but then directs that the
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
party chair or designee shall notify the
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
secretary of state of their choice to
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
conduct rank choice voting in their
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
primary just the primary election
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
and uh each party can act independently
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
whatever one party chooses does not
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
apply to the situation of another party
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
i would say that um generally i've
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
always supported any bill that lets the
 
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
parties decide how they want to go about
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
choosing the candidates for the general
 
02:19:55.439 --> 02:19:56.550 align:start position:0%
choosing the candidates for the general
election

02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
so this would be consistent with
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
positions i've taken in the past
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh on on bills dealing with how the
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
parties are going to
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
choose their designees
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh i thought it was unclear in the
 
02:20:10.710 --> 02:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
original bill uh which is addressed in
 
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment in section three how towns
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
and cities needed to come to a
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion that they wanted to try
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
as i read the original bill it almost
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
sounded like the board of selectmen or
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
city council could take a vote and
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
decide to implement rank choice voting
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
but i wanted it to to go to the voters
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
so that the voters are actually making
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
that decision themselves so in section
 
02:20:34.319 --> 02:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
that decision themselves so in section
three

02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
a question has to be put to the voters
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
if whether or not they want to use rank
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
choice voting
 
02:20:40.319 --> 02:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
choice voting
and

02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the towns that would
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
and most cities that would just be by a
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
warrant article a referendum
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
initiative petition whatever process
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
that community uses to put the question
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
on the ballot
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
i did include an exception for cities
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
that might need changes to their
 
02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:01.670 align:start position:0%
that might need changes to their
charters

02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
charters
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
specifically i'm thinking of the cities
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
of manchester and nashua which
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
have primaries set up for some of their
 
02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:10.469 align:start position:0%
have primaries set up for some of their
elections

02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
in manchester it's when two or when more
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
than two candidates are running for a
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
single seat they have to have a primary
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
for that race
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
and in nashua there's a primary in place
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
for the office of the mayor
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
um the state constitution i think it's
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
part second article 39
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
says that no changes can be made to a
 
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
municipal charter
 
02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
unless the a question is put before the
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
voters of the community and they vote to
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
approve that change
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
so there is an exception here saying
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
that if a charter amendment needs to be
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
done to accomplish or institute rank
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
choice voting then that will have to be
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
done through the charter amendment
 
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.190 align:start position:0%
done through the charter amendment
process

02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
and then later on if the communities
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to reverse
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
the choice they go through the same
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
process they put it to a vote of the
 
02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:00.790 align:start position:0%
process they put it to a vote of the
voters

02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that's
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
pretty much what the amendment's trying
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
comments representative sweeney
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think like i've gathered most of the
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
room we'll be voting against cacr22
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
i'll also be voting against hb 1264.
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
i did get a number of calls about it
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
from both sides in support and opposed
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
to ranked choice voting
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
and i have a number of issues
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
with it i could see the argument for
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
state party primaries i really could i
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
could see the argument for
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
even without legislation internally how
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
state parties organize themselves when
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
they elect their state party leadership
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
i have great hesitation and i would say
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
the crux of my reason to not vote for
 
02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:50.469 align:start position:0%
the crux of my reason to not vote for
1264.

02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
1264.
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
either as the amended version or as as
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
originally proposed
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
the the potential of jeopardizing our
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think is at severe risk due to this
 
02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:03.349 align:start position:0%
i think is at severe risk due to this
legislation

02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
a couple years back there was a great
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
project from new hampshire public radio
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
called stranglehold
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
and they had a series of episodes
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
talking about iconic new hampshire
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
primary moments i mean one of those
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
episodes centered on the the magic of
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire presidential primary
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
night when regular granite staters and
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
activists from the campaign stood on
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
stage with a successful or winning
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
or even third place finisher
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the respective party's presidential
 
02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
in the respective party's presidential
primary

02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
primary
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that candidate got to declare
 
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
victory in new hampshire and then the
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
headlines the next morning across the
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
country would say
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill clinton is the comeback kid from
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or john mccain the
 
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
maverick shocks the nation uh in
 
02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:47.590 align:start position:0%
maverick shocks the nation uh in
manchester

02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
with ranked choice voting that would
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
delay the results from our presidential
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
primary uh we wouldn't have it the night
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
of the election nobody would get beyond
 
02:23:56.399 --> 02:23:57.349 align:start position:0%
of the election nobody would get beyond
50

02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
50
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
unless they were the incumbent
 
02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:00.630 align:start position:0%
unless they were the incumbent
officeholder

02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
officeholder
 
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
and so we would not have a scenario in
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
which we would have in a multi-candidate
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
presidential primary the results on the
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
night of the election we might have to
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
wait up to a week south carolina and
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
nevada could be voting before we have
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
the final results from the new hampshire
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
and to me that is a risk in this
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that i'm not willing to take
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
at this time i think this jeopardizes
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
our position as first in the nation uh
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
because it would be we vote first but
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
then we get the results third or second
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
um and that's not something that i would
 
02:24:34.630 --> 02:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
want to entertain
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
but i do want to specify
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
it is a concept that i am not
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
innately opposed to
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
and i did hear from people on both sides
 
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
i do know that that supporters of this
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
had been seeing this as a stepping stone
 
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
to implement it fully down the road into
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
general elections uh and again i'm not
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
there yet um and i'm not sure if i ever
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
but i'm not making this decision lightly
 
02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
this isn't a you know oh i don't like it
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
so i'm voting against it i do want to
 
02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
say and i think all the members here uh
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
really thoroughly
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh discuss this among themselves thought
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
it through in their conditions and i
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to spell out why i would be
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
supporting a motion of an expedient to
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislate on 1264.
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:22.550 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
rain choice voting would not necessarily
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
take a week we think we can have the
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
results the same night there's there's
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
nothing that would prevent that from
 
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
happening in utah they have the results
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
the same night
 
02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:36.230 align:start position:0%
the same night
um

02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
or i would say the very latest the next
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
morning but i think probably we can have
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
the results the same night once
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
the if
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
if in the first round of votes a
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
candidate gets over 50 50 that that
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
candidate is going to win the nominee
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's going to win
 
02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
if it has to
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh if nobody gets over 50 and has to go
 
02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
into a second round
 
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:04.870 align:start position:0%
into a second round
um

02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
the local elections
 
02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
the local elections
uh

02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know local polls don't handle that
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
the results go directly to the secretary
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
of estate
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
which then would put it into a
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
high-speed tabulator which would
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
very quickly
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
calculate the next round
 
02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:24.550 align:start position:0%
calculate the next round
and

02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh so i and the only thing that might
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
take time is until we get our new voting
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
machines which we'll be getting anyway
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know the results would be have to
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
would have to be uh courier to the
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office in a secure
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
courier i mean it could all be done very
 
02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:46.830 align:start position:0%
courier i mean it could all be done very
securely

02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
um so i it's not going to take a week it
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
can be done the same night or very
 
02:26:52.319 --> 02:26:53.429 align:start position:0%
can be done the same night or very
quickly

02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
um so i that is not a problem and
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise it doesn't change anything
 
02:26:59.040 --> 02:26:59.830 align:start position:0%
otherwise it doesn't change anything
about

02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
anything else about the primary
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative alexander
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
um i have some serious concerns with
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting i think like uh
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
what what represented hamlet just
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned with the um courier um i mean
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
i think there's already problems like
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's perceived problems with how
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
ballots are counted and transferring
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
transporting microchip microchips from
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
lancaster new hampshire down to concord
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
first of all won't happen that night but
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
um if it did it's it's transporting that
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
to a secure central location for
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
counting and typically in the past
 
02:27:42.389 --> 02:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
we would report unofficial results out
 
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
of towns and then the secretary of state
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
would certify it later
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
the other problem i have is that ranked
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
choice voting doesn't always guarantee a
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
majority i think if you have a buy-in
 
02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.630 align:start position:0%
majority i think if you have a buy-in
from

02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:27:57.030 --> 02:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
100 of the voters it would
 
02:27:58.710 --> 02:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
guarantee a majority but if you have a
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of voters that go in and vote in
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
the first round
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
and then only some voters vote in the
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
second third fourth fifth round then it
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
actually isn't a majority after the
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
first round um so that's where i have an
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
issue with that um so it just requires a
 
02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
lot of buy-in from the voters i don't
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
think the voters are necessarily there
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
yet um so i'll be voting now thank you
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative murrahood
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
i just understand the presidential
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
primary um
 
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
primary um
rules

02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's i don't think the case that that uh
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know i think the national the
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
national party uh the national parties
 
02:28:31.590 --> 02:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
would have a lot to say about how the
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
nominees would be would be selected and
 
02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
they'd have a lot of influence so i
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill would be inviting
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
our presidential primaries to be run by
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
so uh ranked choice voting does ensure
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh support from the most voters and i
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
think that's what we want we want a
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
candidate that has
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
support from the most voters possibly
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know them
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
all right all right representative barry
 
02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:08.870 align:start position:0%
all right all right representative barry
um

02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'm glad the logistics of ranked choice
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
voting were brought up and uh real
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative by the way thank you for
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
your phone call representative um we had
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
a long conversation and you know my
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
concerns are
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
logistical so i i do want to push back
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the notion that if we were doing a
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
statewide race that we would have
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
results that night or the next day um it
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
assumes a couple of things the first of
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
which is that every single town has a
 
02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:31.510 align:start position:0%
which is that every single town has a
machine

02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
machine
 
02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
they do not so the secretary of state's
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
office will be counting hand ballots for
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting for i think it's
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
about a third of our towns correct um
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's not a third of the votes but it's a
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
third of the towns
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's not insignificant
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
i also brought up for the point of we
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
talk about the presidential primary and
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
i really have avoided trying to do the
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
argument of presidential primary because
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think it gets it there's very times
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's legitimate i think there are
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns here but a lot of
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
times it's not uh but here i think there
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
are some but let's talk about the state
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
primary for a second let's talk about
 
02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:04.870 align:start position:0%
primary for a second let's talk about
2016.

02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
2016.
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
2016 the race for republican governor
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
had a four-way race um
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
then executive councilor uh chris sununu
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh state senator jeannie forrester uh
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
former man
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
then current manchester mayor um
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh ted gatsas and state representative
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
frank edelblut um for those paying
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
attention at home uh representative
 
02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
edelblut got within i believe it was 600
 
02:30:29.190 --> 02:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
or 800 votes
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
of uh counselor sununu at the time
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
and he was well within his right to
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
request a recount he ultimately chose
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
not to um but let's let's say for the
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
sake of argument that we used ranked
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
choice voting and he got within 800
 
02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:45.590 align:start position:0%
choice voting and he got within 800
votes

02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
votes
 
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
well we wouldn't know until two or three
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
days later um because of the hand
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
counting of votes the bringing the
 
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
bringing of the memory cards down to
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
concord um or wherever serialization it
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
would be and probably be conquered
 
02:31:02.070 --> 02:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
and then he requests a recount well now
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
with our abbreviated primary window we
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
have a six to seven week primary window
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's usually about six weeks now we've
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
now we're conducting a hand a recount
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be by hand right so now we're
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
hand counting ranked choice vote ballots
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
and we've missed three days in an
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
already extraordinarily abbreviated
 
02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
window um that doesn't work um it
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
basically you're just handing the
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
election off to the other side by the
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
way if if it happened to my colleagues
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
on the other side we'd be saying oh yeah
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
you should recount this and give up a
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
week of campaigning see what happens um
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know when you're giving up 18 of
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
your campaign window as the general
 
02:31:40.870 --> 02:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
election nominee that's a problem so
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are my concerns with this are
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly logistical i do not think
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and the
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
the 1264 by their own admission um
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
people who support it
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's the they are they're trying to open
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
the door to get it statewide
 
02:31:57.830 --> 02:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
if you want to go statewide with ranked
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
choice voting there are so many things
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
that you have to fix
 
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to you're going to
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
have to if you want speedy results
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to transmit results
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
over the internet we literally just
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
voted against that like we literally
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
just voted that down um so
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
there are there it is a logistical
 
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
nightmare with the way we currently
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
conduct our elections um you can make
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
the argument on a town level it's fine
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
it'll just clarify it goes away but once
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
again the overarching goal of the
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors is to get it to statewide and
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
you're just not there so i'll be
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
first of all the secretary of state does
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
not hand count the votes the secretary
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
of state uses their high speed tabulator
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
so that's not going to be an issue
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
and also it currently takes days for the
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office to certify
 
02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
certified the election
 
02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:54.950 align:start position:0%
certified the election
so

02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:57.270 --> 02:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the immediate results can
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative terezian thank you madam
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
chair just to refresh the committee's
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
memory when we heard testimony on the
 
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
other ranked choice
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill that we had
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
earlier in the
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that in maine
 
02:33:20.070 --> 02:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
this was from the assistant secretary of
 
02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:21.030 align:start position:0%
this was from the assistant secretary of
state

02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
it takes a
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
a week
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
to get the results
 
02:33:26.240 --> 02:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
to get the results
and

02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
we also heard that they do have to
 
02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:31.429 align:start position:0%
we also heard that they do have to
transport

02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
transport
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
those ballots to a central location in
 
02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:34.710 align:start position:0%
those ballots to a central location in
that

02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
i agree with earlier uh testimony that
 
02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's problematic the more you move
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
ballots the more change you have of
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
a risk of losing ballots or misplacing
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
something whether intentional otherwise
 
02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:48.389 align:start position:0%
something whether intentional otherwise
that

02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:51.349 --> 02:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
i think is a needless
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
thing to have to do if
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
i want to remind everybody that we're in
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
a time when
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
a fairly percentage fairly big
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of people
 
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the state are concerned about voter
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
integrity so anything we can do to
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
to help get that
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
confidence back is a good thing anything
 
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
we do that potentially
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
gives a perception that
 
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
ballots moving around and that uh things
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
could be lost and things could get
 
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
misplaced and so forth is not not a good
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
thing so
 
02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's just another reason why i'm
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
um this is only an enabling bill
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to just to try it
 
02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:40.070 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to just to try it
out

02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
we're never going to get comfortable
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
with something new if we don't give
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
people the opportunity to try it out
 
02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:47.349 align:start position:0%
people the opportunity to try it out
and

02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
and some of the some of the
 
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
issues that have been raised may be
 
02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
legitimate but we are not going to know
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
if we don't try it and i guess and i
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't see how it impacts voter integrity
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
i just feel like we should try something
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
new and it has worked in australia for
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
40 years it's worked all over this
 
02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
40 years it's worked all over this
country

02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:35:15.910 --> 02:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
in in municipal elections all over so
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see what we're scared of but
 
02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.750 align:start position:0%
i don't see what we're scared of but
anyway

02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
in maine they it takes day it takes
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
several days a week or whatever to
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
um come up with their results because
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
they allow
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
a week
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
we have to have the results of the
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
election in within 20 i don't know if
 
02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
it's 24 or 48 hours but it's
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's very quick we don't allow a
 
02:35:47.439 --> 02:35:48.469 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's very quick we don't allow a
week

02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
so and it can be done in a week and it's
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
done in other states i mean it can be
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
done in a day and it's done in other
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
states it's done in utah
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the same night the elect the
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
votes are tabulated the same night
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
also as far as the voter integrity
 
02:36:04.319 --> 02:36:05.830 align:start position:0%
also as far as the voter integrity
problem

02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
or issue
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
is that um i believe
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
that what those the voters that are
 
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
worried about the voter integrity i
 
02:36:17.190 --> 02:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
think what they really want to know is
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
that their vote counted
 
02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:20.830 align:start position:0%
that their vote counted
and

02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
um with ranked choice voting every vote
 
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.349 align:start position:0%
um with ranked choice voting every vote
counts

02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
counts
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
the tabulations are completely
 
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
transparent they're published statewide
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
to every voter to see how their votes so
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
every voter can see how their votes
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
factored in
 
02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:38.230 align:start position:0%
factored in
and

02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:39.670 align:start position:0%
and
well

02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
if you you know have had a chance to
 
02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
if you you know have had a chance to
read

02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
read
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
ellen reed's uh
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
results of our our mock chocolate
 
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
election that we had
 
02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:52.150 align:start position:0%
election that we had
she

02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
she
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh gave great a great graphic and great
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
explanations of how
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
um how the runoff rounds work and it's
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
just so clear you can see exactly how it
 
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
there's there's no voter integrity
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
problem here so i think what the voter
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
integrity people need to know is that
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
their vote counted
 
02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
and ranked choice voting ensures that
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative terrorism thank you madam
 
02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:22.630 align:start position:0%
representative terrorism thank you madam
chair

02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
well i would say that right now every
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
vote does count
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
now if you're in a ranked choice
 
02:37:31.359 --> 02:37:32.469 align:start position:0%
now if you're in a ranked choice
environment

02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:37:33.910 --> 02:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
you may get to vote
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
say for six different choices but at the
 
02:37:38.309 --> 02:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
end of the day you still could be as a
 
02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
voter end up with somebody that you
 
02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
didn't pick
 
02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
didn't pick
so

02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:43.750 align:start position:0%
so
if

02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
your vote counts but that you don't
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily get the person that you want
 
02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:48.469 align:start position:0%
necessarily get the person that you want
and

02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
if you're making several choices one
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
could argue that
 
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
you could say
 
02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:54.550 align:start position:0%
you could say
jesus

02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
jesus
 
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know i've i got six choices and my
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
vote still doesn't count because i
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
didn't get the person i want so i think
 
02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:00.790 align:start position:0%
didn't get the person i want so i think
that

02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's you know somewhat misleading as
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
far as the voter integrity the only
 
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
reason i brought it up is be because
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
again in the state of maine maybe we can
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
do it faster i don't know but they said
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
that it took them that long not
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily because
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
just because we don't have that long to
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
do it doesn't mean we can get it done in
 
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
an earlier period of time i heard no
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
testimony that suggested we could do it
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
quicker that's all thanks
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:29.670 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
i

02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
i have been
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this for many years i was
 
02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:35.030 align:start position:0%
looking at this for many years i was
actually

02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
first introduced to the idea of ranked
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
choice voting in 2010
 
02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
of all places at an alec convention
 
02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
in washington dc
 
02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
and uh there are a number of people
 
02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
there it was not a uh
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know part of a presentation or
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
anything but it was uh
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
a number of people
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
with a small booth talking about it and
 
02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
i was intrigued by it because in a
 
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
number especially in the in the
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
presidential primary number of times i
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to vote for a candidate that i
 
02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:08.150 align:start position:0%
wanted to vote for a candidate that i
really

02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
was excited about but i was concerned
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
that if i voted for that candidate that
 
02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:15.590 align:start position:0%
that if i voted for that candidate that
um

02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
um
a

02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
a less conservative and i'm i'm very
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
conservative and i i was concerned that
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
a less conservative candidate would win
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
and so i would not vote for the one i
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
really wanted to so i was intrigued by
 
02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
i am concerned here in new hampshire
 
02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh with our current system our current
 
02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:37.349 align:start position:0%
uh with our current system our current
machines

02:39:37.349 --> 02:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
machines
 
02:39:37.359 --> 02:39:38.469 align:start position:0%
machines
uh

02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of hand voting that's done
 
02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:42.790 align:start position:0%
the amount of hand voting that's done
on

02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
how efficient the process would be i'm i
 
02:39:47.349 --> 02:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
agree with representative berry in that
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
area that the process
 
02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:52.389 align:start position:0%
area that the process
is

02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be difficult to overcome
 
02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:57.590 align:start position:0%
it's going to be difficult to overcome
uh

02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:57.600 --> 02:39:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
however

02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:00.710 align:start position:0%
however
that's

02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why i'm going to
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
support 1264.
 
02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:05.590 align:start position:0%
support 1264.
um

02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is an is enabling legislation
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
it allows us to test this
 
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
on a
 
02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:14.710 align:start position:0%
on a
small

02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
in a smaller setting uh
 
02:40:17.359 --> 02:40:18.790 align:start position:0%
in a smaller setting uh
it

02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
with with the uh
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's amendment it
 
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
gives a fairly detailed process for
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
cities or towns to implement this if
 
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
the political parties can choose or not
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
choose to do it it gives us a chance to
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
test it if this does not work if it's
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
just too complex and there are too many
 
02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:43.349 align:start position:0%
just too complex and there are too many
problems

02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
this legislature
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
will look at it again and can vote and
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
can say we're going to end ranked choice
 
02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:51.830 align:start position:0%
can say we're going to end ranked choice
voting

02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:52.950 align:start position:0%
voting
and

02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:53.750 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that this is a process
 
02:41:01.349 --> 02:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
that has merit to test a concept you
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
know we've we've heard often that states
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
are the laboratories of democracy
 
02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
because we can test ideas before they go
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the federal level in in a sense i i
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
feel the same way about this
 
02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
i do have some concerns about the
 
02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:18.309 align:start position:0%
i do have some concerns about the
constitutionality

02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
constitutionality
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
of it um
 
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
but i see that both ways i
 
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
we are we are starting
 
02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:26.389 align:start position:0%
we are we are starting
uh

02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
with the process as we are and i don't
 
02:41:30.469 --> 02:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
see that our
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
present wording in the constitution
 
02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
require requiring a plurality
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
for bids
 
02:41:38.710 --> 02:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
going another step to bring it to either
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
a higher plurality or a majority so um
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
i i am not going to vote for cacr 22 i
 
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
agree with both uh
 
02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
it's certainly
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that's it there's a
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
place for that right now but i am going
 
02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
to vote for hb 1264
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and i do favor representative
 
02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative terozan thank you madam
 
02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:06.150 align:start position:0%
representative terozan thank you madam
chair

02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
so if this bill was just to have a test
 
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
of the system without be you know
 
02:42:15.269 --> 02:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
involving an actual election i probably
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
could support it
 
02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:17.590 align:start position:0%
could support it
but

02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
if any i understand it's enabling
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislation but for for
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities or parties that decide to
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
use it
 
02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:25.750 align:start position:0%
use it
it

02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:42:28.389 --> 02:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
it's re it will be real if it's used and
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
and that's another concern i have is the
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
inconsistency so you may have a
 
02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
situation in your town where your town
 
02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
decides they want to use this
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:42:39.030 --> 02:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
the party that you identify with doesn't
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
use it so when you go to
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
depending on what election you're going
 
02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:43.030 align:start position:0%
depending on what election you're going
to

02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
you you may not um
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's just one more thing to confuse the
 
02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:47.110 align:start position:0%
it's just one more thing to confuse the
voter

02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
voter
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
gee in this election i get to choose
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
up to five people and the other one i
 
02:42:53.269 --> 02:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
don't it just i think it muddies the
 
02:42:53.279 --> 02:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
don't it just i think it muddies the
water

02:42:57.670 --> 02:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:59.590 --> 02:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:01.910 align:start position:0%
further discussion
um

02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to say a couple of things
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
one i continue to have concerns about
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
page seven of the bill
 
02:43:11.269 --> 02:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph eight that refers to general
 
02:43:12.950 --> 02:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
elections because it was my
 
02:43:15.269 --> 02:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
understanding this was intended to only
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
apply to primary and i think that was
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
brought up because i have notes on it so
 
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything taking that
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
reference out
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
in regards to the references to utah
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
utah uses something called direct
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
recording electronic voting
 
02:43:39.269 --> 02:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
at least in some of its
 
02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
areas which would be exactly what this
 
02:43:45.429 --> 02:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
committee voted not to do
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
and there was currently there was
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to go back to all paper in
 
02:43:52.710 --> 02:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
utah i'm not sure what the status is but
 
02:43:54.630 --> 02:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
certainly their history
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
is that they have electronic vote
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
recording which i think
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
given the size of this state and votes
 
02:44:04.230 --> 02:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
we just took you can't equate the two i
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't think you can get away from the
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
fact that there are logistical issues
 
02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
in doing this
 
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:10.950 align:start position:0%
in doing this
um

02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:12.309 align:start position:0%
um
admittedly

02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
admittedly
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
under the proposal in 1264 at the
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
discretion of
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
who decides to do it
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
and while the municipality may bear that
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
expense in regards to local elections
 
02:44:25.910 --> 02:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state would certainly bear that
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
expense in regards to primary
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i will echo what i think i've heard
 
02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
is that i think a lot of this is to
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
my vote counts is the fact people are
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.230 --> 02:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom line what i think and
 
02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
i think it it started about eight years
 
02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:48.150 align:start position:0%
i think it it started about eight years
ago

02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:49.750 align:start position:0%
ago
um

02:44:49.750 --> 02:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:51.349 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's what's going on
 
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the my vote counted because
 
02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.150 align:start position:0%
with the my vote counted because
um

02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
i i think what you're you're saying is
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
more people will have filled in an oval
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
for someone who won
 
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
and that therefore somehow that makes
 
02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
them think their vote counted as
 
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
compared to just filling in the oval for
 
02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
compared to just filling in the oval for
one

02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest to you when we just
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
had a hearing on a bill
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
that voters could not figure out
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately how to fill out ovals for
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
multiple candidates
 
02:45:25.110 --> 02:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
that asking them to fill out ovals in a
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
ranking order is something that
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
maybe is not a road we should be going
 
02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:32.870 align:start position:0%
maybe is not a road we should be going
down

02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:33.670 align:start position:0%
down
so

02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:35.349 --> 02:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
um those are sort of my comments
 
02:45:37.349 --> 02:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative hamblin
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
in all the recent um
 
02:45:44.469 --> 02:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
ranked choice elections that have
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
happened around the country
 
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
um the exit polls have shown that
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
the voters said it was easy to
 
02:45:50.479 --> 02:45:51.830 align:start position:0%
the voters said it was easy to
understand

02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
and the um man phil steele from maine
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
who testified at the hearing
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
he said
 
02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
at the conceptual level voters have zero
 
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
difficulty understanding
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
that rank choice voting gives them the
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to express their preferences
 
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
among candidates
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
i.e candidate smith is my first choice
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
candidate jones is my second choice
 
02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
voters can figure that out
 
02:46:19.279 --> 02:46:19.990 align:start position:0%
voters can figure that out
and

02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
the second point was that when given a
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
properly designed ranked choice voting
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
ballot and instructions
 
02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
voters have very little difficulty
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
understanding how to mark the ballot the
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
ballot so i i don't
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think voters will be concerned
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:41.670 --> 02:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the ranked choice
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:49.110 --> 02:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so i think at this
 
02:46:50.710 --> 02:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
point it would
 
02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:51.670 align:start position:0%
point it would
be

02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a motion
 
02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
the first bill would be cacr 22 is there
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair i i move cacr 22 itl i
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
believe that can i have a second a
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
second the motion madam chair
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
ed would you like to speak to yourself
 
02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
i believe this would enshrine in our
 
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
constitution something that is untested
 
02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:26.389 align:start position:0%
constitution something that is untested
and

02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
needs a lot more thought before we'd
 
02:47:30.389 --> 02:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
even consider doing that
 
02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
i do believe that
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
it may be required moving forward
 
02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:36.790 align:start position:0%
it may be required moving forward
um

02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:40.389 --> 02:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly not for today
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion the
 
02:47:47.349 --> 02:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any further discussion on
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
the motion i'm going to ask the clerk to
 
02:47:55.269 --> 02:47:55.279 align:start position:0%

it's been moved and seconded to be
 
02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i'll try not
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
to reiterate several things that we
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
were spoken of earlier
 
02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:01.910 align:start position:0%
were spoken of earlier
um

02:54:01.910 --> 02:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
and while again there's you know i can
 
02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:05.030 align:start position:0%
and while again there's you know i can
see

02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's some interesting aspects of this
 
02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:08.870 align:start position:0%
there's some interesting aspects of this
idea

02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
but at this time i can't support the
 
02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
idea for a number of the reasons you had
 
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
heard and for a few others
 
02:54:18.550 --> 02:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:20.150 --> 02:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned this before in the last
 
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
ranked choice vote
 
02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
voting uh bill that we had that
 
02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
i am somebody that goes out and
 
02:54:27.429 --> 02:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
campaigns door-to-door uh very
 
02:54:27.439 --> 02:54:28.710 align:start position:0%
campaigns door-to-door uh very
frequently

02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i find and i'm in
 
02:54:32.070 --> 02:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
a district with four
 
02:54:34.710 --> 02:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
four reps
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
many people
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't even know who their reps are
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
number one number two they're lucky if
 
02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
they could
 
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
identify one that is
 
02:54:44.469 --> 02:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
so i think that it's less than
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
scientific when you get into a ranked
 
02:54:48.630 --> 02:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
choice vote situation where now you have
 
02:54:50.230 --> 02:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
to vote for at least double the number
 
02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
of people that's number one number two
 
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things we heard on this
 
02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
ideas or one of the reasons that people
 
02:55:02.790 --> 02:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
like this is that it helps a third party
 
02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:03.830 align:start position:0%
like this is that it helps a third party
candidate

02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
potentially get in when they can
 
02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise but we also heard testimony
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
from the folks that came down from maine
 
02:55:12.389 --> 02:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
that not one third party candidate has
 
02:55:15.190 --> 02:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
won an election since
 
02:55:17.590 --> 02:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
they they adopted ranked choice voting
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that leads me into a point that
 
02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
um the constitution
 
02:55:23.590 --> 02:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
currently is clear that you can win an
 
02:55:26.309 --> 02:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
election by the plurality of the vote
 
02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
when maine first adopted this they had
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
became it was a rep or a senate race
 
02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:34.070 align:start position:0%
became it was a rep or a senate race
where

02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
that individual won the first round by
 
02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
the plurality yet after they did some of
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
these so-called runoffs he lost the
 
02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
election so that would be problematic in
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where
 
02:55:46.710 --> 02:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
the constitution says plurality it does
 
02:55:48.790 --> 02:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
not say majority so anytime you have a
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
scheme that's going to require a
 
02:55:53.990 --> 02:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
majority that's going to be a problem
 
02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:55.429 align:start position:0%
majority that's going to be a problem
and

02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:57.830 --> 02:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
i won't reiterate but i i do believe
 
02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
problem time wise with getting the
 
02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
the count done election day
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
and while we heard testimony that many
 
02:56:06.479 --> 02:56:07.429 align:start position:0%
and while we heard testimony that many
towns

02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to replace our
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
vote counting machines many towns have
 
02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
ones that are still functional and and
 
02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
don't need to be replaced i understand
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
many do but that's that's
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
there are many that
 
02:56:23.349 --> 02:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
if we adopt this would have to
 
02:56:25.590 --> 02:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
um replace their machines even if
 
02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
they're not to the point of needing
 
02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
needing to be done
 
02:56:30.309 --> 02:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
and the other thing which i mentioned
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
before but i'll just touch on very
 
02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
briefly is that
 
02:56:34.790 --> 02:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
again adding to the potential for
 
02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:35.910 align:start position:0%
again adding to the potential for
confusion

02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:56:38.469 --> 02:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
you could very well with this because
 
02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's enabling legislation have
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
one election where you're voting where
 
02:56:45.990 --> 02:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's the way we do it now
 
02:56:48.309 --> 02:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
and the other election so there's down
 
02:56:50.309 --> 02:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
election maybe the way we do it now the
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
primary election may be ranked choice so
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're flip flipping back and forth it's
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
inconsistent i think that's generally
 
02:56:59.269 --> 02:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
speaking not a good policy to have
 
02:57:00.630 --> 02:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
set up a process that could lend itself
 
02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
to more confusion
 
02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
um with the way we do things and one
 
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
last thing and i'll shut up is that i
 
02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
value our uh first the
 
02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
nation presidential primary and i do
 
02:57:18.309 --> 02:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
believe this would if we adopt this
 
02:57:18.319 --> 02:57:19.670 align:start position:0%
believe this would if we adopt this
um

02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:22.230 --> 02:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
it could put that at jeopardy and the
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
very last thing is that uh i do believe
 
02:57:26.710 --> 02:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
if we adopt this that it will lead to a
 
02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
gateway to have rank choice voting in
 
02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
the general election as well
 
02:57:30.319 --> 02:57:33.190 align:start position:0%
the general election as well
thanks

02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%

about are state general elections

the next bill for executive session here
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:59:43.510 --> 02:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
nope this afternoon
 
02:59:46.950 --> 02:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
is 1324 establishing a formula to
 
02:59:49.830 --> 02:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
allocate presidential electors to the to
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
presidential nominees is there a motion
 
02:59:55.349 --> 02:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative barry yes ma'am chairman
 
02:59:57.830 --> 02:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
i move that hp 1324 be inexpediant to
 
02:59:59.990 --> 03:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislate is there a second second that
 
03:00:01.830 --> 03:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded would you
 
03:00:04.870 --> 03:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion uh yes
 
03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
ma'am very briefly um ironically enough
 
03:00:09.269 --> 03:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation would probably help my
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
party but ultimately i believe new
 
03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a swing state i believe
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
candidates should come here to campaign
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
and even if that means that my party is
 
03:00:18.790 --> 03:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
not winning all the electoral votes i
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
think keeping them all together as an
 
03:00:22.550 --> 03:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
incentive so that new hampshire's votes
 
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
are heard in the presidential election
 
03:00:26.309 --> 03:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
is more important than securing two
 
03:00:27.910 --> 03:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
electoral college votes so i will be
 
03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
voting in expedient to legislate is
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion on this the
 
03:00:34.630 --> 03:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor which is to itl 1324
 
03:00:36.550 --> 03:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
chair i will also be voting uh
 
03:00:41.750 --> 03:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
against house bill 1324 and supporting
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
the motion for an expedient to legislate
 
03:00:46.950 --> 03:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion

um the reason i asked the committee to

find this inexpedient to legislate
 
03:02:48.230 --> 03:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
during our
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the matter is that
 
03:02:52.389 --> 03:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
senate bill 423 addresses addresses the
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
same subject matter it was sponsored it
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
was submitted at the request of the
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
manchester city clerk and it's the
 
03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
manchester delegation that's uh behind
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill 423 so uh this is redundant
 
03:03:06.389 --> 03:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
let's put it out of the way and uh we'll
 
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:08.160 align:start position:0%

never speaks up so i i went to um
well

03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm very confused
 
03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
i would just like to note that i
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
originally was opposed to this bill but
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
hearing public testimony on how there
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
are absolute ballots being mailed to
 
03:04:58.630 --> 03:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
people that aren't registered to vote
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
is really concerning to me um it's it's
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
happening so i think this will close a
 
03:05:05.429 --> 03:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
loophole and clarify this in state law
 
03:05:08.230 --> 03:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm voting ot
 
03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative teresian thank you
 
03:05:11.920 --> 03:05:12.790 align:start position:0%
representative teresian thank you
so

03:05:12.790 --> 03:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for
 
03:05:18.550 --> 03:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
covering one of the points that i had
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
we did hear in testimony that this is
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is a practice that happens so if we
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
heard that from one person i have no
 
03:05:25.590 --> 03:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
doubt it probably happens in other
 
03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:26.630 align:start position:0%
doubt it probably happens in other
places

03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
places
 
03:05:29.110 --> 03:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is common sense legislation
 
03:05:29.120 --> 03:05:30.550 align:start position:0%
this is common sense legislation
and

03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is i can't think
 
03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
of any good reason why to send an
 
03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
official absentee ballot to somebody
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's not a registered voter
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
and all this bill does is it closes that
 
03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
loophole and requires
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
the individual that requests the
 
03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot to be a registered voter
 
03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:50.790 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot to be a registered voter
and

03:05:50.790 --> 03:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:53.110 --> 03:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
prior to getting the ballot now i know
 
03:05:55.030 --> 03:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
some will argue well let's
 
03:05:57.030 --> 03:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
you you need to get registered to vote
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
then and that's that's true you do and
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
you and you can and um let's see we have
 
03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
a town election coming up in march so
 
03:06:05.910 --> 03:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's plenty of time to go get
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
registered and the next state election
 
03:06:10.870 --> 03:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
won't be to what september so
 
03:06:10.880 --> 03:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
won't be to what september so
um

03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of time for people to go
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
out and do that and
 
03:06:16.950 --> 03:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
if for some reason you missed before you
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
pulled an absentee ballot you could
 
03:06:20.469 --> 03:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
still go down and
 
03:06:21.910 --> 03:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
do a same-day
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
registration this this bill in no way
 
03:06:26.550 --> 03:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
prevents that so i ask you to
 
03:06:27.830 --> 03:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
come with me and
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
support the otp motion on 1153 thank you
 
03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:33.520 align:start position:0%

and i i do recall the discussion that
 
03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:44.550 align:start position:0%
and i i do recall the discussion that
some

03:06:44.550 --> 03:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:06:47.349 --> 03:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
residents may obtain absentee ballots
 
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
without being first registered to vote
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
but as was mentioned during
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
testimony this is specific situations
 
03:06:55.600 --> 03:06:56.389 align:start position:0%
testimony this is specific situations
where

03:06:56.389 --> 03:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:06:59.110 --> 03:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
individuals are asking to register to
 
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
vote absentee perhaps they're you know
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
away at school maybe they're they've
 
03:07:05.429 --> 03:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
gone down to florida for the for the
 
03:07:05.439 --> 03:07:06.790 align:start position:0%
gone down to florida for the for the
winter

03:07:06.790 --> 03:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
winter
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
and they're requesting an absentee
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
ballot at the same time and as was
 
03:07:13.030 --> 03:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
explained during public testimony what
 
03:07:15.429 --> 03:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
will then occur is both the application
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the absentee ballot come back
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh sealed in the absentee ballot
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
envelope and on election day at the
 
03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
envelope and on election day at the
polls

03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
polls
 
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
the moderator will open that first the
 
03:07:26.710 --> 03:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
voter registrar makes a decision as to
 
03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not to allow that person to
 
03:07:30.630 --> 03:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
be added to the checklist as a same-day
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
election voter registration
 
03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
and if they're added to the checklist
 
03:07:37.990 --> 03:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
then the absentee ballot can be counted
 
03:07:40.150 --> 03:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
now i know there was testimony that
 
03:07:40.160 --> 03:07:41.590 align:start position:0%
now i know there was testimony that
apparently

03:07:41.590 --> 03:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
03:07:44.230 --> 03:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
this process wanted to be eliminated
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
but you have to consider the amount of
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
time it takes for mail to go to go back
 
03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
and forth
 
03:07:51.990 --> 03:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
i received a a christmas card this year
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
that was mailed on december 20th that
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
was delivered on january 20th and that
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
just came from portland maine
 
03:08:00.790 --> 03:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
so my point is if you're taking three
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
four five weeks to get the voter
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
registration application out and then
 
03:08:06.389 --> 03:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
have to wait another three four five
 
03:08:08.230 --> 03:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
weeks for the absentee ballot to be
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
mailed out and returned you're probably
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
going to disenfranchise a number of
 
03:08:14.070 --> 03:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
people and it's a very small number of
 
03:08:14.080 --> 03:08:15.110 align:start position:0%
people and it's a very small number of
people

03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:08:16.790 --> 03:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
i would also point out that regardless
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
what the intent was if you look at the
 
03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
actual language in house bill 1153 it
 
03:08:24.870 --> 03:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything it's just redundant
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh the actual current language says upon
 
03:08:29.349 --> 03:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
receipt of a properly executed
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
application for an absentee ballot the
 
03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
town of city clerk shall ascertain if
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
the applicant is on the checklist and if
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
so send the ballot and the new language
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
says under no circumstance so a town or
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
city clerk mail an absentee ballot
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
unless the person has submitted an
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
application it's the same language that
 
03:08:49.510 --> 03:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
already appears in the statute so i in
 
03:08:51.030 --> 03:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
my opinion it's redundant it's
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and it doesn't even address
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
the situation which some supporters of
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative terezian
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
after hearing that testimony i
 
03:09:11.349 --> 03:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
guess some people may have a second
 
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
03:09:14.550 --> 03:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
voting by absentee ballot if it's taken
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
three weeks for the mail to come so
 
03:09:16.960 --> 03:09:17.910 align:start position:0%
three weeks for the mail to come so
um

03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
you could use that argument either way
 
03:09:21.910 --> 03:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
but no
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
i understand it doesn't create a lot of
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
extra language but it it reinforces the
 
03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
idea that you should be a registered
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
voter before
 
03:09:31.520 --> 03:09:32.389 align:start position:0%
voter before
you

03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:09:33.269 --> 03:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
get an
 
03:09:35.349 --> 03:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
official absentee ballot and i did
 
03:09:37.429 --> 03:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
consult with both the past secretary of
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
state and the current secretary of state
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
on this and they both supported the idea
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
and said that they quite frankly were
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
surprised nobody else had done this
 
03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:46.070 align:start position:0%
surprised nobody else had done this
earlier

03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes so i was actually originally
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to vote against this bill i didn't
 
03:09:52.710 --> 03:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
think it was necessary
 
03:09:54.389 --> 03:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
and then the town clerks association
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
came and
 
03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
opened my eyes to how necessary it is
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are sending actual
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
ballots to people who are not registered
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
03:10:05.590 --> 03:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
that is ridiculous
 
03:10:07.110 --> 03:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
that is ridiculous
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
i asked the um i asked the
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative from the town clerk
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
association he said well we don't just
 
03:10:14.389 --> 03:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
send them to just anyone and i said well
 
03:10:16.710 --> 03:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
what if i call if i say hey it's a week
 
03:10:17.830 --> 03:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
for the election and i call up from
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
derry and i say hey i'm not registered
 
03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
to vote are you going to send me a
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
balance i said yes that is just anyone
 
03:10:24.630 --> 03:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
so it i want to thank the sponsor i
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
didn't think this was necessary
 
03:10:29.269 --> 03:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
it turns out yes we are in fact mailing
 
03:10:31.830 --> 03:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
actual ballots to people who are not
 
03:10:33.349 --> 03:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
registered to vote
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
that is cause for alarm it leaves a a
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
gaping wide open loophole
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
that somebody could just request you
 
03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
know they could do this 30 times and
 
03:10:42.630 --> 03:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
then those ballots magically arrive on
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
election day and there's zero
 
03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to verify this person
 
03:10:48.309 --> 03:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
actually is who they who actually is a
 
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
registered actually as a resident of the
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
state don't want to go back to that has
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
their primary residence in the state how
 
03:10:54.710 --> 03:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
about that um
 
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's no opportunity to verify that
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it leaves a
 
03:10:58.560 --> 03:10:59.670 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it leaves a
a

03:10:59.670 --> 03:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:11:03.030 --> 03:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
six-lane highway open for abuse um we
 
03:11:06.070 --> 03:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
should not be sending actual ballots to
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
people that are not registered to vote
 
03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's what we're voting on you're
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're voting to stop sending actual
 
03:11:13.590 --> 03:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
ballots to people who are not registered
 
03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
to vote that's that's ridiculous
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%

03:12:33.830 --> 03:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
prior to the date of a state primary
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
election there was also an amendment
 
03:12:38.070 --> 03:12:38.080 align:start position:0%

03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing is there a
 
03:12:40.239 --> 03:12:41.349 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing is there a

03:12:43.349 --> 03:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney madam chair i
 
03:12:45.990 --> 03:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
move we find house bill 1166 and
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
03:12:49.510 --> 03:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
03:12:51.510 --> 03:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
i second that madam chair thank you
 
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney yes ver very
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
briefly i i do want to just say i i
 
03:12:59.030 --> 03:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the scenario
 
03:13:01.349 --> 03:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is trying to prevent
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
with this legislation however i think
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
all too common for both sides of the
 
03:13:06.399 --> 03:13:07.510 align:start position:0%
all too common for both sides of the
aisle

03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
aisle
 
03:13:10.150 --> 03:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
and for anyone organizing candidates for
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
the ballot you'll have a situation in
 
03:13:14.710 --> 03:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
which somebody that could regularly go
 
03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
to local committee meetings be involved
 
03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
in their local
 
03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
either republican or democratic party
 
03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:22.950 align:start position:0%
either republican or democratic party
apparatus

03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
apparatus
 
03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
and then they they tell them in march
 
03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know i'm gonna run for state
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative on this upcoming election
 
03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then we get to june and its filing
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
period is opener coming up and then
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're like oh i've actually been an
 
03:13:36.870 --> 03:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated voter this entire time i
 
03:13:39.190 --> 03:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
need to switch my party affiliation
 
03:13:40.469 --> 03:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
could be a
 
03:13:43.830 --> 03:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
a true republican a true democrat in the
 
03:13:46.229 --> 03:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
sense of ideology
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
and no disagreement there but just had
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
not taken the step to register at that
 
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
party until right before filing for the
 
03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:54.710 align:start position:0%
party until right before filing for the
election

03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:13:56.229 --> 03:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
does not mean that they are not a
 
03:13:58.790 --> 03:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
full-throated supporter of that party um
 
03:14:00.550 --> 03:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
it just means that their paperwork was
 
03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
not filed and putting in this in this
 
03:14:06.469 --> 03:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
provision to stretch out the the time
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
they would have to
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
change their party affiliation before
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
running for office would be a big burden
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
on parties on both parties that fill
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
seats uh sometimes in areas that aren't
 
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily friendly to the parties so
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's why i would suggest everyone
 
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
vote for this to be an expedient to
 
03:14:27.190 --> 03:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you
 
03:14:29.030 --> 03:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
bergeron oh thank you thank you madam
 
03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:31.830 align:start position:0%
bergeron oh thank you thank you madam
chair

03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
i also will support the motion to find
 
03:14:36.150 --> 03:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
this an expedient to legislate
 
03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
and and i can
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
verify what the previous speaker was
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
saying regarding people's perception of
 
03:14:44.229 --> 03:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
how they might be registered to vote
 
03:14:44.239 --> 03:14:45.429 align:start position:0%
how they might be registered to vote
um

03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:47.110 --> 03:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the city clerk's office in nashville
 
03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
for example it was not at all uncommon
 
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
for people to
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
revert back to an undeclared status
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
after voting in a primary and not
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
realize when it comes close to the time
 
03:14:59.910 --> 03:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
for filing that they never declared
 
03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
themselves to be a republican or a
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
democrat even if maybe they voted that
 
03:15:06.550 --> 03:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
way for 30 or 40 years previously
 
03:15:09.429 --> 03:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
um i i think the voters are entitled to
 
03:15:12.229 --> 03:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
some flexibility uh to stay unaffiliated
 
03:15:14.150 --> 03:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
if they want to and then change to a
 
03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
declared party if they want to run for
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
office at a later time and i
 
03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
can verify that many times
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
the chairs of city committees would be
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
walking people into the clerk's office
 
03:15:27.910 --> 03:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
to verify that they're registered in
 
03:15:30.070 --> 03:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
that party so that they can run for
 
03:15:31.750 --> 03:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
office and if it's done prior to the
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
checklist closing they will declare
 
03:15:34.870 --> 03:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
themselves a member of the party so that
 
03:15:36.870 --> 03:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
the party can fill the slate
 
03:15:38.550 --> 03:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't think this is a good
 
03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:40.790 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't think this is a good
idea

03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
idea
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the motion the
 
03:15:48.070 --> 03:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative teresa just a quick point
 
03:15:52.229 --> 03:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
of clarification maybe i mis heard
 
03:15:54.870 --> 03:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
something i thought i heard the the
 
03:15:56.550 --> 03:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
last speaker say that you'd have to
 
03:15:58.550 --> 03:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
declare what party you're um affiliated
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
with before you register to vote you
 
03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
have to do that now did i miss something
 
03:16:02.560 --> 03:16:03.269 align:start position:0%
have to do that now did i miss something
there

03:16:03.269 --> 03:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
um no if i could clarify it you have to
 
03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
declare your party before you file for
 
03:16:09.429 --> 03:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
candidacy file an office for kennedy so
 
03:16:11.190 --> 03:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
if you're unaffiliated and you want to
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
run as a republican you need to declare
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
that you want to be a member of the
 
03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
republican so you're changing your voter
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
registration form you're changing it
 
03:16:20.229 --> 03:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
from unaffiliated status to to
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
republican status so you can run as a
 
03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:28.070 --> 03:16:28.080 align:start position:0%

the bill implements the solution
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
recommended by judge mcauliffe in his
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
decision on a previous bill
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
in which
 
03:19:14.790 --> 03:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
he suggested that there was a broad
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
restriction against all contributions
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
and he said that was too broad and that
 
03:19:23.030 --> 03:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
what needed to be done
 
03:19:25.590 --> 03:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
was exactly what this bill does is to
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
make a level playing field for
 
03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
corporations and labor unions
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
and that is it
 
03:19:34.160 --> 03:19:35.110 align:start position:0%
and that is it
for

03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chairman yes i would
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
i'm having read the bill and listen to
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
the testimonies of public hearing uh
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill attempts to address
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
the potential for conflict or appearance
 
03:21:31.830 --> 03:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
of conflict
 
03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
which can be presented with certain uh
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
election officials
 
03:21:39.269 --> 03:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
and and also uh inspectors of uh
 
03:21:42.950 --> 03:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
election perform election day duties
 
03:21:44.550 --> 03:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh for elections in which they also
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
appear on the ballot
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
it proposes to do so by disqualifying
 
03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
these particular officials from
 
03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
performing election duties in such an
 
03:21:54.880 --> 03:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
performing election duties in such an
election

03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
the bill would also prohibit such
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
officials from remaining inside the
 
03:22:01.830 --> 03:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
guard rail during the counting of votes
 
03:22:03.190 --> 03:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
for the offices for which they are
 
03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
candidates and furthermore
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
it proposes that the presence of such
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
officials in the vicinity of the polling
 
03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:11.110 align:start position:0%
officials in the vicinity of the polling
place

03:22:11.110 --> 03:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:22:13.670 --> 03:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
would be confined to the
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
areas designated for electioneering by
 
03:22:18.389 --> 03:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
the moderator
 
03:22:20.790 --> 03:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of sympathy for the in
 
03:22:23.590 --> 03:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill but
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
for me it presents a number of
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
unresolved issues
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
first of all i'm concerned about the
 
03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:32.150 align:start position:0%
first of all i'm concerned about the
constitutionality

03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
constitutionality
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh of the bill
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh the bill's proposal uh in part one
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
that in order to present conflict uh
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
prevent conflict or perceive conflict uh
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
the moderator will would be deprived of
 
03:22:50.550 --> 03:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
his or her constitutionally mandated
 
03:22:52.710 --> 03:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
authority and duty to govern elections
 
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
and quote receive the votes of the
 
03:22:56.790 --> 03:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
inhabitants unquote
 
03:22:58.229 --> 03:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure all familiar new hampshire
 
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
constitution part 2 article 32.
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
in addition the proposal
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
to limit
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
an official's presence to the designated
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
electioneering spaces this is in part
 
03:23:08.800 --> 03:23:10.070 align:start position:0%
electioneering spaces this is in part
three

03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
for me raises uh
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
significant first amendment concerns the
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
law is currently constituted
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
requires the moderator to provide
 
03:23:22.710 --> 03:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
a space designated for electioneering
 
03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
but only excludes electioneering from
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
the 10-foot wide
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
non-electioneering corridor that
 
03:23:30.950 --> 03:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
provides access to the polling place for
 
03:23:30.960 --> 03:23:32.309 align:start position:0%
provides access to the polling place for
voters

03:23:32.309 --> 03:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
voters
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
so to apply a restriction like this only
 
03:23:37.590 --> 03:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
on certain specific individuals these
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:43.510 --> 03:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be an infringement on
 
03:23:48.070 --> 03:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:48.080 --> 03:23:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
also

03:23:49.349 --> 03:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
the bill proposes to
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
impose these provisions on the moderator
 
03:23:58.309 --> 03:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
selectmen and supervisors of the
 
03:23:58.319 --> 03:24:02.389 align:start position:0%
selectmen and supervisors of the
checklist

03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.229 --> 03:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
there are other election officials
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
required and generally president
 
03:24:07.590 --> 03:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
election and the rationale for not
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
imposing these
 
03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions on these other uh election
 
03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:16.389 --> 03:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
the town clerk the deputy moderator and
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
assistant moderator and so forth i don't
 
03:24:21.190 --> 03:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
see the rationale for limiting it only
 
03:24:22.229 --> 03:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:24:22.239 --> 03:24:22.950 align:start position:0%
to the
the

03:24:22.950 --> 03:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:25.349 --> 03:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
moderator etc
 
03:24:27.750 --> 03:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh and finally during the uh public
 
03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
hearings uh for me uh
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh well practical concerns were raised
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
by those giving testimony and also by
 
03:24:37.190 --> 03:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
some of our committee members
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
which to me uh
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:46.229 --> 03:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
and these concerns uh regarded
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
the availability of knowledgeable and
 
03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
willing substitutes for the moderator in
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
particular and that would apply to these
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
other officials as well
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
with some experience as a selectmen in
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
in a municipal government i i do think
 
03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
that would be it couldn't sometimes be a
 
03:25:05.190 --> 03:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
practical impossibility to find someone
 
03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
to replace the moderator
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
the bill in excluding town clerks from
 
03:25:13.510 --> 03:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
their list of uh disqualified
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
officials who can be disqualified it
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
seems to imply that town clerks could
 
03:25:18.550 --> 03:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
fill that position but as we heard in
 
03:25:19.990 --> 03:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
town clerks have a very different uh
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
training that they undergo
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
and also i couldn't find anywhere in the
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
rsas that empowered a town clerk
 
03:25:33.670 --> 03:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
to govern an election so the question
 
03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
would become
 
03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
who then shall govern the election if
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
the moderator is excluded
 
03:25:39.990 --> 03:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative quayley does
 
03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to speak to the motion
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
chair i support the motion to find this
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
bill in expedient to legislate i think
 
03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:51.590 align:start position:0%
bill in expedient to legislate i think
the

03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
previous speaker did an eloquent job of
 
03:25:55.590 --> 03:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
summarizing all the reasons why the bill
 
03:25:57.190 --> 03:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
should not be passed
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
um i i would just note that well i
 
03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
thought the sponsor gave a very good
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
reason why the bill was introduced
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me more like an
 
03:26:08.790 --> 03:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
electioneering issue and not
 
03:26:10.710 --> 03:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
an issue where you suddenly throw out
 
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
all the election officials who were
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
working in a polling place throughout
 
03:26:15.590 --> 03:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
the state because one person
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
may have misused the authority that was
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
given to him in his particular polling
 
03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
given to him in his particular polling
place

03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:26:25.349 --> 03:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
i would also note that this issue has
 
03:26:25.359 --> 03:26:26.070 align:start position:0%
i would also note that this issue has
been

03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
getting discussed now for almost 50
 
03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:28.950 align:start position:0%
getting discussed now for almost 50
years

03:26:28.950 --> 03:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:26:31.349 --> 03:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
and every session someone comes along
 
03:26:33.269 --> 03:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
with an idea to tweak it and make it run
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
a little better uh i think the process
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's in place right now is is a pretty
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
good one
 
03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh it ensures that the people who are
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
most experienced uh and who are elected
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
by their voters to conduct the elections
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
are allowed to perform those duties at
 
03:26:51.429 --> 03:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
the polling places and so i will also be
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
voting uh to find this bill in expedient
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
03:26:57.830 --> 03:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody else wish to
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
speak representative terozian thank you
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair i too will be voting for the
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate
 
03:27:05.120 --> 03:27:06.150 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate
motion

03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:27:06.160 --> 03:27:07.030 align:start position:0%
motion
um

03:27:07.030 --> 03:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
and primarily because of the
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional aspect of i didn't see
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
any way around
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
this i thought there were many uh
 
03:27:18.389 --> 03:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill that
 
03:27:19.990 --> 03:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
made sense
 
03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:20.870 align:start position:0%
made sense
and

03:27:20.870 --> 03:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
but the the fact that this is a
 
03:27:23.439 --> 03:27:25.030 align:start position:0%
but the the fact that this is a
constitutional

03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
03:27:27.429 --> 03:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
requirement that the moderator conduct
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
this i didn't see a way to solve that my
 
03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
hope however is that going forward and i
 
03:27:33.429 --> 03:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
know it's been 50 years maybe somebody
 
03:27:33.439 --> 03:27:34.389 align:start position:0%
know it's been 50 years maybe somebody
will

03:27:34.389 --> 03:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
figure a way to to
 
03:27:37.830 --> 03:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
to solve this because i can tell you i
 
03:27:41.190 --> 03:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
hear from constituents and others that
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
when they see a
 
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
town that has a town moderated he may be
 
03:27:46.150 --> 03:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
running into state rep election doesn't
 
03:27:47.670 --> 03:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
really matter they say how come he gets
 
03:27:49.030 --> 03:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
to be inside
 
03:27:49.040 --> 03:27:49.910 align:start position:0%
to be inside
when

03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:27:51.190 --> 03:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
all the rest of people have to be way
 
03:27:53.590 --> 03:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
out in that corral you know
 
03:27:55.110 --> 03:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
in some places that's practically a mile
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
and a half away from where you come into
 
03:27:57.910 --> 03:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
the building but
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
i digress um so
 
03:28:02.550 --> 03:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
the reality is it is a carve out it is
 
03:28:04.469 --> 03:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and anytime we have
 
03:28:05.590 --> 03:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
something that's inconsistent that
 
03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
always bothers me it was the old saying
 
03:28:10.630 --> 03:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh laws for thee but not for me and so
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony that the election
 
03:28:15.429 --> 03:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
hearing laws are
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient to
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
make this this inconsistency okay
 
03:28:25.429 --> 03:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
um but one could argue and
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
and i had
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
have suggested that if if we feel that
 
03:28:31.349 --> 03:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
strongly about our election laws being
 
03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
that well
 
03:28:34.710 --> 03:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know being that strong
 
03:28:36.309 --> 03:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to have to put um
 
03:28:38.710 --> 03:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
people that are running
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
when they're an active
 
03:28:42.150 --> 03:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
candidate on the ballot
 
03:28:44.150 --> 03:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
a long distance away from where the
 
03:28:45.990 --> 03:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
voter comes in so we we have a double
 
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
standard here and i hope in the future
 
03:28:50.070 --> 03:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
we find a way to solve that thank you

i concur with representative teroshian
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
and his view and i think it's something
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
that should be solved because
 
03:29:10.389 --> 03:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
i was shocked to see people who were on
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
the ballot behind it when i
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
went in to vote and it is
 
03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think one of an election integrity
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
issue so thank you

representative sweeney thank you madam
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
03:30:55.349 --> 03:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
i'll try to be as brief as i can this
 
03:30:57.269 --> 03:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
bill does have a number of issues that i
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
think is important when we consider our
 
03:31:00.309 --> 03:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
votes today
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
the first part of the bill
 
03:31:04.229 --> 03:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
would require candidates or political
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
committees or political advocacy
 
03:31:08.469 --> 03:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
organizations who donate funds to other
 
03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
candidates political committees or
 
03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organizations
 
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
to report the amount which they're
 
03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
already doing but then also itemize the
 
03:31:19.830 --> 03:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
source of the funds that they are
 
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
contributing to another organization
 
03:31:25.349 --> 03:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
which we already do in a sense we any
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
candidate political committee political
 
03:31:29.190 --> 03:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization in new hampshire
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
that currently raises or spends at least
 
03:31:30.800 --> 03:31:32.870 align:start position:0%
that currently raises or spends at least
500

03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
500
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
has to report their campaign finance
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
expenditures and receipts
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire uh to
 
03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
put on an additional requirement that
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
when they are making direct
 
03:31:46.389 --> 03:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
contributions to other entities that
 
03:31:48.790 --> 03:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
they trace back where the funds came
 
03:31:51.269 --> 03:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
from in particular is it kind of
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
highlights a misunderstanding of how
 
03:31:56.309 --> 03:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
campaigns and political organizations
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
operate and organize their funds
 
03:32:01.269 --> 03:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
there's no real tracking
 
03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
that takes part currently at that level
 
03:32:04.870 --> 03:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
and this would require an almost an
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
obscene amount of tracking
 
03:32:09.429 --> 03:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
for campaigns and committees as is
 
03:32:11.830 --> 03:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
there's also another part of this bill
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
we had already dealt with uh in 2021 uh
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
with legislation
 
03:32:19.830 --> 03:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
tying llcs and the donations that llcs
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
make to the members of the llcs and when
 
03:32:23.910 --> 03:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
we discussed and debated that
 
03:32:25.670 --> 03:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
legislation at the time
 
03:32:27.670 --> 03:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
there is no state database to the
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
members of llcs in new hampshire
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
nor do we have good tracking of members
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
of llcs not from new hampshire
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we really can't there's nothing to
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
compare it to to say oh there's you know
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
x amount of members in this llc uh and
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
then to then take it and push it against
 
03:32:46.870 --> 03:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
individual members contribution limits
 
03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
when it is funds from the llc and not
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
the member as is in state law
 
03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
is just untenable with our current
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
operations and i i think is an affront
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
to free speech
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
which is why i would ask you all to vote
 
03:33:02.070 --> 03:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
and expedite it to legislate thank you
 
03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
03:33:05.279 --> 03:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
chair

03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:33:08.790 --> 03:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
i think sometimes when we're dealing
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
with transparency and election laws and
 
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
campaign receipts and expenditures
 
03:33:16.389 --> 03:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
we we have to take try and create a
 
03:33:16.399 --> 03:33:17.429 align:start position:0%
we we have to take try and create a
balance

03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
balance
 
03:33:17.439 --> 03:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
balance
between

03:33:19.590 --> 03:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:33:22.469 --> 03:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech if you will
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
the right to donate campaign funds to a
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
campaign or to a candidate
 
03:33:28.870 --> 03:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
along with issues of transparency and
 
03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
along with issues of transparency and
accountability

03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
this bill would not deny someone the
 
03:33:34.710 --> 03:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make political
 
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
contributions through
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
the shell of an llc or the organization
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:42.389 align:start position:0%
of a
llc

03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
llc
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
but what it does require is that
 
03:33:48.070 --> 03:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
political contributions uh by a limited
 
03:33:49.990 --> 03:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
liability company be allocated to
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
members of the llc
 
03:33:55.269 --> 03:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
that would thereby prevent the llc from
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
cloaking the identity of donors from
 
03:33:59.429 --> 03:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
in-state out-of-state even foreign money
 
03:33:59.439 --> 03:34:01.110 align:start position:0%
in-state out-of-state even foreign money
sources

03:34:01.110 --> 03:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
sources
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
state campaign finance statutes do not
 
03:34:06.070 --> 03:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
discuss define or even mention llcs
 
03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
currently and this bill is an attempt to
 
03:34:10.630 --> 03:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
close the leap polling improve
 
03:34:12.550 --> 03:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability in our
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
election laws and and therefore i will
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
be voting against the motion to find
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
03:34:26.229 --> 03:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
work in construction and real estate
 
03:34:30.229 --> 03:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
and development
 
03:34:30.239 --> 03:34:31.910 align:start position:0%
and development
and

03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
llcs are
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
the preferred
 
03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:37.030 align:start position:0%
the preferred
vehicle

03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
for investment in real estate properties
 
03:34:41.590 --> 03:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
and sometimes a property we're
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
developing right now will very likely
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
have six or eight investors
 
03:34:49.750 --> 03:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
we do hope it will be profitable for the
 
03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
investors and
 
03:34:54.550 --> 03:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
we might make political contributions
 
03:34:55.990 --> 03:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
from that if it was six or eight
 
03:34:58.469 --> 03:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
investors and you spread out a hundred
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
dollar contribution or a five hundred
 
03:35:02.790 --> 03:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
dollar contribution um
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
it would be manageable i don't think
 
03:35:06.790 --> 03:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's right be manageable but many real
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
estate llcs will have 50 or 100 or 200
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
investors if it's a a high level
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
development project
 
03:35:18.479 --> 03:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
development project
and

03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
if if that
 
03:35:25.510 --> 03:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
llc then makes again a 500 or even a 5
 
03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
000 contribution and has 200 or 400
 
03:35:29.359 --> 03:35:30.389 align:start position:0%
000 contribution and has 200 or 400
members

03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:35:32.070 --> 03:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
that have
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
invested in that llc it's a completely
 
03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:36.830 align:start position:0%
invested in that llc it's a completely
uh

03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
unsustainable um way of of doing that of
 
03:35:43.269 --> 03:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
making sure that that goes out and again
 
03:35:45.510 --> 03:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
as it's been testified we don't keep
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
track of of who all the individuals are
 
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
who invest in that so um i i too will
 
03:35:54.550 --> 03:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of the itl
 
03:35:56.550 --> 03:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion

03:35:59.439 --> 03:36:00.550 align:start position:0%
representative lane
the

03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
secretary of state could
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
when a llc is formed asks for the names
 
03:36:07.750 --> 03:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
and put it in the database and it's a
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
simple fix they ask for the
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
incorporators when a corporation is
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
formed and they are all listed
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
as with an llc they could ask that same
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
question and it will be in the database
 
03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:21.030 align:start position:0%
question and it will be in the database
so

03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's a problem that can be easily fixed
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
