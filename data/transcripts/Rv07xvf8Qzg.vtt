00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
me we'll start this momentarily my clerk
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
is out to see why you didn't get paper
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
copies of all the eight bills that we're
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
talking about today but they were
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
emailed to you and I had asked her to do
 
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
that so that with the Press of a button
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
you could print them all so cost you a
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
little bit of paper but you can have
 
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
them ahead of time and just before we
 
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
start and uh rep representative will oh
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
before we start I wanted to mention next
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
week the Republicans will have a caucus
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
at 9:00 we'll send that out we start
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
executing at 10:00 we're going to have
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
these eight bills to exact in the
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
morning then late morning we're going to
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
start the last three bills we currently
 
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
have so we have one I believe it might
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
be 11 or 11:30 then we go 12 for break
 
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
then 1 and 130 and that will finish the
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
last three bills because we have a total
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
currently currently of 21 bills I am
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
going to put on the afternoon to exact
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
the last three bills
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
if it looks like you don't want to do
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
that in the end then we can come back
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
another day to exec three bills but I
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
thought since we're coming to the house
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
three weeks in a row then we have the
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
February vacation that three bills
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
didn't seem too onerous for us to take a
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
little bit of time and exec them in the
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon so as I told the leader uh
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
minority leader I'm not going to just
 
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
pull that note that's on all these that
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
we can exect any time so I thought for
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
the sake of notice and publication I'll
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
tell you we're going to list it those
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
three extra bills not extra the last
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
three bills in the afternoon it does not
 
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
mean we won't get more but if we exec
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
them all and then I want to thank
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
everybody for all that y'all did to get
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
in the reports because they're being
 
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
submitted today so the speaker will like
 
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
that so he ask me where's your reports
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
from resources well we're giving them
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
all of them right today so watch the
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
calendar cuz those will be coming up not
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
this week but in the future on the
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
calendar so hopefully we'll be done
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
executing all our early bills and a
 
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
couple of non- early bills that are on
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
our agenda if this coming week we get
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
more bills well then we're going to come
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
back again and hear those bills
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're basically all set until
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
maybe crossover but um I can't tell you
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to get more bills I
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
just thought um it would be appropriate
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
to finish what we have on the table
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
because if we do if you're prepared next
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
week to do the eight three more is not
 
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.990 align:start position:0%
week to do the eight three more is not
too

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
Alison would you give the caucuses time
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
to caucus if we decide to exec those
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
three bills in yeah I as long as I don't
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
exec them before the time I say we're
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to EXA and I'm told I have the
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
power and authority to decide that day
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to EXA them and move it
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
to another day but at least everybody
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
knows we're going to so you can prepare
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
in advance so there's no surprises
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
everybody knows if we get together and
 
00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
say look it's just not time or we're in
 
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
a major snowstorm and the people from
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
Coos like Arie uh Davis says I got to
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
leave so you know we can adjust but for
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
the sake of having it on the agenda
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
because if it's not on the agenda I
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
can't do it so unless I surprise and I
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to surprise so now you know
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
so that's what we anticipate in the
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
future we're going to miss about three
 
00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
people here today I understand they're
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
all watching the cable of today's
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
hearings um and I wish that they get
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
well or their mother and father are well
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
there's some illness in our families of
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
our members so but they all told me they
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
would watch the testimony on the stream
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
live stream so if I could ask you all to
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
rise as we start this session I'm going
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
to call on my good friend the
 
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%

Hollis um and I come to you today as the

prime sponsor of this bipartisan bill
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
that has been perfected over the last
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
two years to allow local planning boards
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to request water studies
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
when planning subdivisions to ensure
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
water adequacy as housing density
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
increases in residential areas the
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
Inception of the bill came from a
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
constituent whose private well um
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
productivity had been adversely affected
 
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
when a 30 plus Housing Development went
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
in not far from their property this man
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
was talking to me at the transfer
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
station in my town in 2022 and his
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
closing point was that water is is an
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
essential resource and that water
 
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy affects um existing homes as
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
well as um the productivity of wells for
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
new homes in um in water systems and
 
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and I took his point didn't
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
know what to do with it as most of us do
 
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
when someone comes to you with something
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's really not the area that you that
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
you work in um so I began looking into
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
it and um and it we formulated it into a
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill which has come before this
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
committee twice so it's it it came
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
initially I was I happened to be out on
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
an emergency medical thing and I wasn't
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
here to present it the first year so we
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
brought it back the second year and we
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
had some input uh from the Department of
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services water division um
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
and they brought some historical
 
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
perspective to the hearing by telling us
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
that uh in the early
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
2000s the legislature devised a Water
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
Commission to look at water use and uh
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
water issues uh water quality throughout
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
the state and one of the conclusions
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
that they came to uh was that that local
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
um governing bodies and planning boards
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
needed to have something in statute that
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
asks them to look at adequacy and um and
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
F the future of a resource but how to do
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
it was you know nobody had a good idea
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
at that time of how to move forward and
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
that was their testimony from Dees they
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
said people didn't really know what
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
would be a good way to resolve that uh
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind local control and not
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
having a mandate so nothing was done and
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
their testimony was and I I haven't been
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
in touch with them this year so I'm not
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
sure if they'll be here today or if
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
they've submitted anything was that this
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
bill is consistent with what they had
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
suggested and so we were trying to get
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
it over the Finish Line last time um and
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh what we wanted to do is make sure
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
we're not mandating costs we're not
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
mandating activities we're just simply
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
explicitly putting in the Planning and
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
Zoning section under subdivision
 
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
regulations language that says local
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
planning board boards May request a
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
water supply study in accordance with
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
local regulations to ensure water
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy as housing density increases so
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's a very practical um statutory
 
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.110 align:start position:0%
it's a very practical um statutory
language

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
that uh planning boards can kind of hang
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
their hats on to say in this instance
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
with this development that you're
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
putting in we think we should have a
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
good understanding of of what putting in
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
all of these uh wells will do uh to
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
local water
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
supply so that's the reason behind it um
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
there are other reps I think here to
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
testify maybe
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
not um but you can see on the bill if
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
you have it um that we have uh
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and uh representative
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
Bill Boyd uh Rosemary rung
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative Diane
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
power um K Murray and Nancy Murphy are
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
all co-sponsors on the bill um and they
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
had some familiar familiarity with it
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
last time uh represent of powers husband
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
sits on a planning board in a a house
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's part of the co-op with Hollis in
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
Brookline and he actually supported the
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
bill and submitted testimony to this
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee last time in favor of the bill
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
um and they had input on the bill um for
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
this time one of the things that was
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
changed that was recommended in the past
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
is to have an exclusion that says that
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
the provision shall not apply to
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
community water systems or larger or
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawal uh that
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
regulated under RSA 485 and RSA
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
485c um we think that's a real
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
Improvement to the bill we don't want
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
there to be any confusion about what
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
this is and what it isn't uh so it's a
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
very narrowly tailored Bill and again
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's not mandatory so that those are the
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
things I would like you to kind of take
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
away from my
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
testimony um let's see if I have
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
anything else here I'll close by saying
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
that as the competition for
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
environmental resources like water
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
increases in complexity simple changes
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
that allow local planners to apply some
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
foresight in their review of
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
developments can ensure that we don't
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
have new homes that require water
 
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
curfews we have had that in the state
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
and again Dees uh Water Division had
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
testified to that uh that there have
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
been some beautiful mcmansions and then
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
they could could not use the water
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
certain times of day because of lack of
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
water um or existing neighbors who lose
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable waterf flow from their Wells
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
after years of living in a home so we
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
should be able to protect people from
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
these outcom comes um the bill
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
identifies that the planning board may
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
require that the applicant uh absorb the
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
costs of notifying abutters and
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
conducting the necessary investigation
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
so it's basically part of a development
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
cost um if there is a study completed it
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
it isn't something that's passed on to
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um and so I ask that you find
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
HB 568 ought to pass uh when you do exec
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
it now that I know your exact schedule
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
um and give us the ability to encourage
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
foresight in planning that will protect
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
homeowners and home buyers and pay
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
dividends in better planning as we move
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
forward to rapidly increase our housing
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
stock in the state thank
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
McNab I'm gonna be McNab like mcke I
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
like it um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question sure um did you
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
was has there been in discussion of the
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
size of the development that you would
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
do this for like does it apply could it
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
apply to like three lots just the same
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
as it would apply to the original Bill
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
we we've had a few issues in Translation
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
in um with OS this year and um for
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
example the description I noticed says
 
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.789 align:start position:0%
example the description I noticed says
this

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
bill I guess it says allows the adoption
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
of subdivision regulations but it says
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
that require and it isn't required so
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
the language is a little uh confusing
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
but to your specific question um what
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
was your point if you thought if you
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
thought of the number yeah the original
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
Bill said four and above and I would I
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
would have wanted that language carried
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
over I don't I don't really know why it
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't carried over but I think the fact
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
that it's not spelled out is an issue so
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
it was a subdivision of four or above
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
and we could would love it if you would
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
put that back in because it would that
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions I have one if I may sure um do
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
you remember last year's bill number and
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
what happened to the bill last year um
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
you know I could find it for you if my
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
purse was here but I think I dropped it
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere outside when I was hanging up
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
my coat so um I I don't to lose I don't
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
have it do you have it will he has it
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative Darby um the bill was uh
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
HB 1483
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
for um and we uh retained it over the
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
summer um and um then I believe we
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
passed it uh well not passed it we wrote
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
a recommendation of future legisl future
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you representative and
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it no other
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
Vil thank you Mr chair I'm just looking
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
at the online submissions and there is a
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
submission from a repes uh from a Cheryl
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
Howard member of town planning board and
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
who has concerns about impact of
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
development on their town so to get to
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
the gist of it it just said that it
 
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to provide some basic
 
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
parameters for local boards perhaps a
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
provision could be added indicating
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
inherence for subdivisions or four or
 
00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:21.799 align:start position:0%
more Lots yeah so would we have that be
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
more specific in the bill I would prefer
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
it it it should have been in here it was
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
in uh the prior bill
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
chair anyone else no other questions
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation
 
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.549 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation
appreciate

00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
it so that's one of the online uh and I
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
know representative NAB wanted to get
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
into the record and then we'll ask for
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
the blue sheets from representative
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
Sergeant um the online were 10 in favor
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
sheets oh that's right I have another
 
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.230 align:start position:0%
sheets oh that's right I have another
speaker

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
sorry remind me later you give the blue
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
sheets uh speaking against uh Bob Quinn
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
associ is that better Bob Quinn CEO of
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
Realtors um so we are opposed to the
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
bill due to the fact that there is no
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
definition of what a water supply study
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
means um back in
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
2010 uh this legislature uh submitted a
 
00:20:54.679 --> 00:20:55.430 align:start position:0%
2010 uh this legislature uh submitted a
a

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
report which is the recommendations for
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate roles of municipalities and
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawals um in which they
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed various uh possibilities for
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
these sorts of studies and whether or
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
not this would allow or require a
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
hydrology study which my understanding
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
of hydrology study is it's very
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
expensive it's also very complicated and
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
challenging to understand or is it
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
something that would require a pump test
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
but without some sort of this bill right
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
now doesn't really have any parameters
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
on it um anything over four units so if
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the sponsor plus
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
any sort of study um the cost can get
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
significant and um we would ask the
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
committee to potentially just take a
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
look at this bill and read the report it
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
came out in 2010 and maybe it's
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate to really do it better to to
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
do a a a committee I know legislator is
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
not always thrill with study committees
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
um to look at um how frequently these
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
sorts of incidents takes place and
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps the best way to resolve it using
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
um both the municipality as well as the
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and with that I
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
will end my testimony thank you any
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
questions for the speaker representative
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
um are there
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
um you know 49% or the high 40% of house
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
households in the state get their um
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
water from Wells um and so uh ensuring
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
adequate water supply um uh of a
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
property that's going to be sold um must
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
be a concern of the Realtors when
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
they're you know when they're selling
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
them so what what would uh the Realtors
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
recommend in order to ensure um that uh
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
the properties that are going to be
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
developed have adequate water supply and
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the surrounding um properties that
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
um share the aquifer um are not going to
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
be impacted and ultimately reduce their
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
property values yeah so I think working
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and trying to
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
identify um best cases for how to do
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
that I think is appropriate um I just
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
don't think that this bill where there
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
is no definition of what water supply
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
study is um you might do a complete
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
hydrology study it would cost $100,000
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
or more and at the end of the day you
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
may not have information that's suitable
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
or adequate to answer your question so I
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
think that the bills need some work uh
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
and we would enourage I median sale
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
price of a home in 2024 was
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
$515,000 um yes the cost of these
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
studies are not going to be passed on to
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers but they are going to be
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
passed on to the buyers uh of those of
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
those properties and we're just going to
 
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
be inflating the cost a little bit so we
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that if we do
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
that it's done in an appropriate Manner
 
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
and one that um provides the best level
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
of information to the planning board U
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
supply representative NAB um thank you
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a question for him and
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
also a question for you so my question
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
to you would just be could you send us
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
the 2010 study or point us in the
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
direction of where we'd find it I've got
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
a copy right here I'm happy to leave it
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
okay um is it online somewhere is right
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
behind me he can probably tell you where
 
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.190 align:start position:0%
behind me he can probably tell you where
it

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
is okay um and a question to you is you
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
know he suggested understanding better
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
how frequently this happens in the state
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
it's definitely a concern in our town
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
and has been a discussion and um so I
 
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate this legislation and I wonder
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
if there if the researcher for the
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee um or Dees would be able to
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
address the issue of um of subdivisions
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
that have had falling failing water
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
supply systems or concerns about water
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
withdrawal if he suggested answering
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
that question I'm not sure if there's a
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
way to get at that data I don't know if
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
our researcher would have it but when
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
the speaker's done maybe we could ask
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
the representative of Dees if they even
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
have such a study yep and if he does he
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
could submit it along with the report
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
any more questions for the
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
speaker hearing none thank you for your
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
testimony would would you like to come I
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
know I don't have a pink card but my
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
clerk will make sure that I asked for
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
you to fill one
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
out for the record and members of
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Brandon kernin I'm the
 
00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:27.559 align:start position:0%
administrator of the drinking water and
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau at Dees and we did
 
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
submit a written letter of testimony um
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
primarily referencing the work in 2010
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
of a groundwater commission that looked
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
at groundwater issues for the state for
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
10 years in the early 2000s um relative
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
to the question of the occurrence of
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
clusters of private Wells having
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
struggles we don't have a lot of
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
incidents of that but we certainly every
 
00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
few years become aware of it and do
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
surveys of homeowners in area and work
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
with officials primarily in places like
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
Windam or places where there's a lot of
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
ledge and Hilltop developments you know
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
Wells on ledge on Hills tend to fail
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
more often than Wells and other places
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
where you don't have overburdened sand
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
and flat
 
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
topography and so the groundwater
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
commission kind of being aware of this
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
going back in the early 2000s from
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
Bedford to Windam and a few other places
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
came up with a study that looked out a
 
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
way where municipalities where they have
 
00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:27.799 align:start position:0%
this issue could address it if they
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to to and and propose some
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
language that could be put into statute
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
that would enable them to proactively
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
get ahead of this um they they develop
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
their report they develop model
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
ordinances they're not Dees ordinances
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's a legislative commission's
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
ordinance and that's available
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately the commission which had a
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
lot of stakeholders representing all
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
interests from a to builders to
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
environmental stakeholders to
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities they while they accepted
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
the report as being complete and
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
thorough there wasn't consensus that it
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
should be recommended that it be
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
implemented so it was a report that was
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
issued and left for the future to decide
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
if it should be put into law or not and
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of where we're at right
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
now so if this bill were to pass it
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
would enable towns to look at
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
proactively at Water quantity issues and
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
and there's some tools from that Old
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
report that municipalities could pick up
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
and put into their local
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
regulations but that's it's really up to
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
policy makers at this point decide if
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's needed um it's not widespread that
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
we have these issues they again they
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
just seem to intermittently come before
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
us but we we are aware of some some
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
towns that have these problems once in a
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
while any questions for the
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
repesentative from
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
Dees representative Darby thank you Mr
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
um with New Hampshire's experience some
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
wild weather you know over the last
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
let's say decade um in particular over
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
the last five years where gone from you
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
know severe drought conditions to severe
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
flooding conditions in um some of the
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
severe drought conditions um there's
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
been lots of reports and we heard over
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
the last uh couple sessions um you know
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
people running out of out of groundwater
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
um is is is there any um is there any
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
concern that without a um doing uh some
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
kind of a evaluation that we could
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
exacerbate those um those you know uh
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
Wells running dry during these drought
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
conditions I I can't say that I mean we
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
certainly have been in a period of more
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
frequent droughts the last five years
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
but that's preceded by 10 years of no
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
droughts so you know definitely comes
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
comes in waves and as you look at
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
transient climate conditions it's hard
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
to say that we're going to have more
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
prolonged droughts I mean overall we're
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to get more precipitation and
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
so to the extent these studies are it
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
might be that you that they not just
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
look at the potential for Wells
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
dewatering but how to develop a more
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
robust well and that's some of our model
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
ordinances that you know drill deeper
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
well ensure new homes have more robust
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
water supply as opposed to the minimal
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
well where you go down 300 feet get four
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
gallons a minute for four hours and
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're good to go maybe do something
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
that is deeper so you have more storage
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's more fractures and was more
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
resilient so you know that is something
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
that could be considered in over long
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
term based on transient climate
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
conditions have a follow up follow up
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for that
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
answer um Mr Quinn uh suggested that we
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
asked Dees about how um how uh
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
to um assess how you know a municipality
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
could assess the adequacy of the water
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
supply um and was concerned about you
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
know um Hydra rology studies which I we
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
talked about last year I understand are
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
expensive um does dees have a have an
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
alternative to hydrology studies to um
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
to suggest to uh
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities we do I mean often when
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
there's concerns at the local level
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
about a new development impacting
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
private Wells the first thing we need to
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
do is really find out if there's concern
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
and anecdotally you'll hear all these
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
Wells are going dry there's lots of
 
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
problems but we've learned over the
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
years you got to actually back that up
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
with information and so before we spend
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of time running around doing
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
studies and with that we actually go out
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
and try to collect information and do
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
surveys of existing homeowners that are
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
reliant on Wells to figure out are there
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
problems to what extent there are
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
failing Wells and then already we
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
receive on a occurring basis well
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
completion reports where well drillers
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
every time they drill a well have to
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
submit a report to the state and they to
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
say why they're submitting it and if
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's a replacement well for a failed
 
00:31:01.389 --> 00:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
well or new well for new development we
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
can see that and so we can start
 
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
plotting from our surveying of existing
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
homeowners and also from the data we
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
have in hand why new wells are being
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
installed if it's because Wells are
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
failing we can see if there's problems
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
and we have excellent Statewide data we
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
have um Statewide parcel data so we can
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
start coloring in Parcels for existing
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
homes with a failed well new homes with
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
a new well and you can start seeing
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
where there's problems or there's not
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
It's always important to really
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
ground ground any concern with the data
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
you have in hand before you go crazy
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
looking at it for a problem so we we can
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
do any any
 
00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
questions I have one thank you for
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question you say you have some
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
proposed um ordinances to your knowledge
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
is anybody adopted these ordinances
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
already any town no and I want to be
 
00:31:57.639 --> 00:31:58.629 align:start position:0%
already any town no and I want to be
clear

00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
although the department developed the
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
the ordinances it was at the request of
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
the groundwater Commission of the
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
legislature so they're not our
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations so so they're not online
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
but I certainly can provide them to you
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
um as far as towns that have done this
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
to some extent a lot of people interpret
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
current statute as enabling planning
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
boards at either at the site plan review
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
or the subdivision level to require
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
these kind of studies it's kind of vague
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
but some towns do this and I know
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
historically Bedford used to require
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
studies where there wasn't penu water
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
Waterworks water available in a new
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
water supply being developed um but
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
generally speaking no these aren't
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
frequently implemented thank you any
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr Karen
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
see set your hand up it's a followup to
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
your question I just want to clarify so
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
um towns may be able to adopt the
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
ordinances that have been suggested in
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
the report but it's it's not totally
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
clear that they like would this
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
legislation help clear up clear up that
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
Authority for them to adopt it yes it
 
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Darby did you have
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
no okay anyone else thank you Mr caran
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that's it thank you you can
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
you can step back and now the blue
 
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.350 align:start position:0%
you can step back and now the blue
sheets

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
yeah we have uh two in favor one neutral
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then I do uh have the online up as
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
well which was 10 in favor and three
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
post but I can say that when I say the
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
blue sheets if you like that would help
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
out I think just to keep people
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
noticed okay I don't see anyone else
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
approaching the mic I have no more pink
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
cards so I'm to clearing the hearing on
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
HB 568
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
closed and uh and
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
30 seconds or less will open the hearing
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
FN I don't know why when
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
representative done did you find out
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
say she's getting
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be starting HB
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
582 you have pink cards pass them
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:50.190 align:start position:0%
 
than

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
I think my clerk went to see if we could
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
get some paper copies of the bill so
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
I'll give him a second to come back
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative Derby when you you're
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
done on your pink card can you pass it
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
you that means your presentation will be
 
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.710 align:start position:0%
you that means your presentation will be
short

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
so I hereby open the hearing on HB 582
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
FN relative the safety requirements for
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
operation of personal watercraft and we
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
have the prime sponsor representative
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
Darby to speak first
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh chairman
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
harb um honorable colleagues of the
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
resources Recreation and Development
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
Committee for the record I'm represented
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
will Derby from Hillsboro District 11 uh
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
representing the welcoming people of
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
national award 8 this bill is focused on
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
increasing safety on our crowded Lakes
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
um jet skis um personal watercraft um
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
are uh very affordable um option for
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
that allow many to recreate on New
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's magnif magnificent public
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
Waters many of my friends own jet skis
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
and um the vast majority of jet ski
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
users that I see are
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
responsible some background um last uh
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
term we uh heard a bill on um a
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
different bill on personal water uh
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft also known as jet
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
skis um and we learned from the
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety that um with
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the safety requirements
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
they're treated the same as boats who
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
can drive them um meaning 12-y olds with
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
a uh with an adult present um the uh uh
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
PFC requirements um and they're they're
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
not treated even though they are very
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
different from boats they're not treated
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
differently from
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
boats um they uh however um p uh
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft for example have no
 
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
gunnels they have nothing to restrain
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
the rider other than holding on to um
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
the handlebars or other um handles or
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
each other on the on the um on
 
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
pwc's these have um many of them have
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
very large engines um 200 300 plus
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
horsepower engines are not uncommon they
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
have incredible acceleration some can
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
accelerate to 60 M an hour in um under 4
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
seconds and the top speeds of many are
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
over 60 5 miles an hour um they're
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
effectively motorcycles on water now I
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
have nothing against personal watercraft
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
like I said I have a lot of friends that
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
that um use them these are different
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
from um the statutes uh from the
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft um a subclass of
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft that our statutes
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
called ski craft which were regulated in
 
00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
1988 um these are one to two person
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
watercraft typically people uh stand on
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
them or or um kneel on them um they're
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
typically Two Strokes a lot louder um
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
the industry subsequently um adopted
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
sort of built out a new class of these
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
public personal watercraft which are
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
three people they are much quieter um
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
and for the most part not exclusively
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
but for the most part people don't have
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
a problem with them on the lake as long
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
as the the the usage isn't um egregious
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
like you'd expect for most uh most
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
people recreating on the lake you know
 
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
share the resource as a personal
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
experience um I think people know I've
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
shared that I have a camp on Lake
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
monomac in ringe New Hampshire in
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
2017 um there was a 29-year-old woman
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
that fell off the back of uh was a
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
three-person uh PWC she fell off the
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
back um they were towing a rope she got
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
caught in the Rope um dragged and
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
drowned um so this you know there um
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's just an example of how personal
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
watercraft are dangerous and and need to
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
be um uh and cannot be considered the
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
same as regular
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
boats um I also uh you know people might
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
recall my testimony last year on um WG
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
surfing um this is not a wake surfing
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
Bill and in fact this bill does not uh
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
restrict um uh intend to restrict any
 
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.550 align:start position:0%
restrict um uh intend to restrict any
behavior

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
what I mentioned was that uh WG surfing
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
is pretty common and what and the
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
egregious thing is that we see people um
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
on these um typically the threers
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
watercraft jumping the wakes very
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
closely very close behind people um wake
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
surfing it's not always even clear if
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
the people are on are you know in the
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
same sort of group or if they're just
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
chasing the biggest wave ultimately for
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
Thrill Seekers there's two re there's
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
two ways to get um um you know a thrill
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
out of a PWC one is going very fast
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
another is jumping wakes while it is
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
illegal to um to leave the water it's
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
already against the uh there's already
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
statued against that these these um
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
pwc's are so large that they can't
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
actually get out of the water but um but
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
you can clearly understand when you're
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
20 feet behind somebody on a on a um
 
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's WG surfing it's very dangerous um
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
situation this bill um brings into
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
compliant basic basically
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
uh re um drives compliance with PWC
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
standards um the handout that I've
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
passed out unfortunately I wasn't able
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
to fully um highlight all the sections
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
but I think you'll get the sense the the
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
handout I um I sent around comes from
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
two different manufacturers um of uh
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
pwc's um the the things that I
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
highlighted or started to highlight um
 
00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
are the uh align with the um the
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
regulations in this stat in this bill so
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
one is um don't drive the uh don't drive
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
the PWC um after dark I think that's
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
pretty obvious um one is uh where a
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
personal flotation device when you can
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
get thrown off um it uh there adds a lot
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
of risk another is and this is the
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
important this is a really important one
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
to me um is making sure that the
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
operator is 16 years of age or older
 
00:42:59.069 --> 00:42:59.079 align:start position:0%
what you'll see if you read through um
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
these handouts that I provided is that
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
the um un uh PWC makes it or the PWC
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
manuals make it very clear that there's
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
an operator and there's a passenger and
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
the operator needs to be able to operate
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
the machine independently um of um the
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
passengers and they even recommend don't
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
um don't operate the watercraft unless
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
you are have spent uh substantial time
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
operating it alone well in this state
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
you can't operate a PWC um by yourself
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
unless you have a um a a safety card and
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
are 16 years of age therefore you can't
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
get the required um uh training say
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
independent training under the age of 12
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
but somehow if your um if your parents
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
sitting behind you um which I seen a lot
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
a lot um uh you can you know drive one
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
of these things down the middle of the
 
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
lake um okay
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
so the next thing I'll mention is I met
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
with um uh Department of Safety and
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol a couple of times um prior
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
to this both before I filed the
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and and also a follow-up um
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Edwards um to
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
Captain den leevy and the lieutenant
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's uh uh in charge of Marine Patrol
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
um I adjusted the language based on uh
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
their recommendations for safety and I
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
got um agreement from the Department of
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
Safety that this is a bill focused on
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
safety that this is not a bill um that
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
restricts Behavior it is uh focused on
 
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
safety yesterday um Captain Dunley
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
provided me statistics um uh that I I'm
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
sure he can provide them to the
 
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:40.559 align:start position:0%
committee or I can uh statistics that
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
show over the last Dozen Years or eight
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
years or something that there's um been
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
PWC accidents every year and there's
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
been injuries most years um including uh
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
fatality um the now I am a member of
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
this committee I know we just itl
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
a a bill on a um wearing personal
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
flotation devices for kayakers based on
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility and I recognize
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility is an important
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
aspect of New Hampshire's culture um but
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
this um but pwc's risk the safety of
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
others I'll give you just a couple of
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
examples as briefly as I can you know
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
imagine that a 12-year-olds um uh riding
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh with their parent behind them through
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
heavy traffic lots of lots of turbulence
 
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
they lose their balance a little bit um
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
accelerate um parent falls off uh they
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
go into another vessel another is you
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
know somebody puts on some aftermarket
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
lights um you know the same times that
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
you can just sort of screw on so that
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
they can ride after um dark
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
legally and they're cruising around um
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
cruising down a lake at 50 miles an hour
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
which is legal on all lakes except when
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
of is saki and another boat's passing by
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
they surely don't expect a small
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
watercraft going at that speed they
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
misjudge the distance you know um
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
catastrophe another is you know related
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
to the example I provided earlier jet
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
ski um you know jumping the Wake behind
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
a wake Surfer uh lose control because of
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
the very large wakes that uh these um
 
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
that these produce the wakes surfing
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
produces um the uh wake Surfer happens
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
to fall at the same time catastrophe
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
these These are you know these are not
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
these are easy to imagine scenarios
 
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
everything I just said that this bill
 
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
will help to um retain or support this
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
um we say a lot that um the co the key
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
to um uh to save flakes is education and
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill will actually
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
promote education why because when you
 
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
have statutes on the law um the Marine
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol can stop somebody not to
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
issue a ticket but to say
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
um the um law uh has been changed now
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
you have to wear a a p a PFD when um
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
when you're rioting rather than just
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
have it in the compartment in the front
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
um you know please do that in the future
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
or you know you're rioting after dusk I
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
know it's still Twilight but you really
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
can't do that these are the types of
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
things that they can stop people um and
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh not to issue tickets but just to
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
inform that um I think they'd be less
 
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
able to do without this legislation at
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
the end of the day um
 
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:29.559 align:start position:0%
we P there was uh Common Sense
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislation passed on skcraft uh in the
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
80s like I mentioned and this update
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
will um keep up with changes in modern
 
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
equipment um and of course I'd be happy
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
with in in the um in the goal of
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility if this
 
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
committee said that they wanted to re
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate the requirement to our PFD
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine with me I'd be happy to
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
take that Amendment and leave the rest
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
of it in there I'm H uh thanks very much
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
Sergeant thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
essentially would you agree that this
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation simply expands RSA
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
27074 which currently governs ski craft
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
to a larger device that didn't exist in
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
the 80s when ski craft legislation uh
 
00:48:26.589 --> 00:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
was enacted well that that's thank you
 
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:28.839 align:start position:0%
for the question uh that's a pretty
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
delicate subject um we had a bill that
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
did that last time and what it ended up
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
doing was Banning ski uh pwc's or there
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
was a concern about banning pwc's in on
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
a large number of water bodies and also
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
open up opening up um the um um the uh I
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
forget the petition system to ban pwc's
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
on B bodies this is not intending to ban
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
pwc's at all um so um this is a safety
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
requirement only and it is narrowly
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
focused on uh a few safety re
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
guess my point was this language that
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
you're proposing uh including on the
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
personal flot flotation devices just
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
mirrors what's already in law governing
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
the smaller vessels yes thank you um for
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
the question that's exactly the intent
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
the um uh when the that statute was
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
written um the they looked at Common
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
Sense legislation um
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
which uh is modeled here because the
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
devices are very
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
similar any other questions for
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative Darby representative NAB
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
my question so are there currently any
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
statutes around miners have to wear
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
having to wear a PFD on these
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
craft does the 16-year-old already have
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
to wear a PFD I I I should have read
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
this I I think Captain dun Le is here he
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
can tell you for sure okay um because
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
they do in a kayak um yeah yeah there's
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
some there is some restriction for for
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
minors okay thank you anyone else anyone
 
00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.190 align:start position:0%
minors okay thank you anyone else anyone
else

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
knew no one knew representative Sergeant
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman last question RSA
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
270 colon 74 hyphen C personal
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
watercraft already regulates personal
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
watercraft in terms of how close it can
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
go to some Shores on some bodies of
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
water is that correct yes thank you that
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
was actually in my testim I just skipped
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
over that's that's a very good point
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
pwc's are already defined in statute so
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
this doesn't introduce a new definition
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
um I forget the the year it was uh 2018
 
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
2020 something like that that they were
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
added um in some of the some of the
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
estuaries um uh to restrict um you know
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
to restrict where pwc's could go but
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
that um it doesn't Define the safety
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
requirements for them but it does like
 
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
you um uh like you mentioned already
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
Define pwc's so this isn't introducing a
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
new term thank you for the
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
question assume no other
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative for
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%

maintaining the stewardship our clean
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
Waters I come before you to an
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill 582 I want to
 
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the New Hampshire
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
Marine trades Association is for Public
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
Safety and we have supported many bills
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the past regarding P personal fation
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
devices but find this one
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
unnecessary we recently discussed this
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
bill with in our membership and many of
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
us our jobs are on the water every day
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
in the summertime found it very
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
surprising that this is even a conf
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
ation because no one can remember anyone
 
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
on a personal watercraft not wearing a
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
personal flight personal flotation
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
device um we also meet with the New
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Safety each year
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it's never been brought to our
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
attention this was either a problem or a
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
concern um we have asked for some data
 
00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
we have found that there was very little
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
to uh to back up anything at all um the
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
change in this definition of a bill
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
concerns us and Jo will speak to this
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
more in detail but in the state of New
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as representative Dar
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned a watercraft with a capacity
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
of few passengers more is considered a
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
boat and regulated that way and always
 
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.309 align:start position:0%
boat and regulated that way and always
has

00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
been we strongly believe in BHA
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
education in the handbook distributed by
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire of voting
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
laws and responsibilities it is
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
recommended that an operator or personal
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
watercraft be equipped with a lanyard
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
type engine cut off switch and that
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
attachment to his or her person's a
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
clothing oror life
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
jacket by my observations every day at
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
work um like I mentioned before
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
operators of personal watercraft take
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
their safety of their passengers and
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
themselves very seriously and if you
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
were to do any type of a Google search
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
with the word personal watercraft they
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
would demonstrate every person on a
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
watercraft wearing a personal flotation
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
device um if this committee finds that
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
there is an issue when it comes to
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
Public Safety uh the New Hampshire
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
Marine change Association would be happy
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
to assist in education campaigns um we
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
already do so in the past regarding WG
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
surfing and other issues uh with our New
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine Patrol the New
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of of public
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
broadcasters and other uh National
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
Building Partners um we find that this
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
bill pleased to be inexpedient to
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislate um to answer a few questions
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
that were brought up momentarily in the
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire ages 13 years and
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
younger are required to re life vests on
 
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.870 align:start position:0%
younger are required to re life vests on
any

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
vessel um there is 150 foot safe passage
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
Bill already on place when it comes to
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
passing other votes so IE when you're
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
talking about wake surfing and jumping
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
waves regardless of WG surfing boats any
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
boat makes a WG and if you want to jump
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
it you need to be 150 ft back from that
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
vessel to be regarded as doing it
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
legally which is already illegal as it
 
00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:41.799 align:start position:0%
is and
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
lastly uh any parent with I would hope
 
00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
common sense that would allow their
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
child to drive a personal watercraft
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
ahead of them would detach the safety
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
lanyard from their child and put it on
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
themselves so that the adult fell off
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
the life jacket off their personal what
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
the personal the P personal
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
watercraft the machine would die and the
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
child would not continue to drive down
 
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
the lake alone so again more common
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
sense than anything else but those are
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
limitations to the watercraft when you
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
clip it to yourself and all life checks
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
typically have a clip sewn into them
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
that attaches the lanyard to it so that
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
directly thank you let's hold our
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions until uh Miss scbl also gets
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
to talk and then you can ask all the
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions to both of them uh Jody sure
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to go through the bill
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
and kind of give you our perspective on
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
each each section um the reason why we
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
believe this bill is unnecessary um the
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill lines three
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
through five is that definition of
 
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.589 align:start position:0%
through five is that definition of
personal

00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
watercraft um it's a Statewide
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
definition of personal watercraft it's
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
different than the carve out that's for
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast you'll notice the language
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
in that section is just for that section
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
regarding the Hampton
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
Estuary similar legislation to adopt a
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide definition of personal
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
watercraft has been has been defeated in
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
this legislature for over 30 years it
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
came in 11 times between
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
1991 in
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
2003 um personal watercraft has always
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
been classified the same as every other
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
boat and there's a reason for that
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
because for those who have been on this
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee for for a number of years to
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
Define it means you'll there'll be
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities to restrict it so we're
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
we're very concerned about that
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide definition of personal
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
watercraft because as we saw last year
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
then there are bills to therefore
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
restrict or ban Public
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
Access we believe the existing laws
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
address boating safety already um again
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
currently all boating safety laws for
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
every other vessel apply to these
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft Marine Patrol cited
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
data um in a senate hearing a couple
 
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
weeks ago that according to the Coast
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
Guard reports New Hampshire has boasted
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
the best safety record in terms of
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
fatalities per 100,000 registered voters
 
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
in the nation for 13 years we should be
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
proud and I do have the statistics that
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
that representative Derby spoke about um
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
which I'll pass out for the commity we
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
can talk about um there's not a lot of
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
data specifically about personal
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
watercraft but we do have what the
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
department of safety gave us last night
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
in the past six Summers there's been 26
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
total accidents on personal water craft
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
and ski Craft um in one instance there
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
was no life vest because it actually
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
says it on the on the statistics um out
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
of 26 over six years we have over a
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
100,000 boats registered each year that
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
does not include boats that come in from
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
other states as well as all of the
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
paddlecraft that are out on our water
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
bodies as well so we do have a lot of we
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're it seems like the voting laws we
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
have now are working well
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
um again that definition of ski craft
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
was 1988 the bans and restrictions on
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
ski craft came over probably the bulk of
 
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:05.559 align:start position:0%
them came in the first few years after
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
that into the early 90s approximately
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
50% of New Hampshire waterways are
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
closed to those craft so we do get
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
worried about bills that seem to Define
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
because the next step is that
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions in ban now specific to the
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bill um you'll go down
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
kind of it's the RSA 27 74d is the new
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
section um the first letter a is that um
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
you can only operate the person
 
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
watercraft if the person is 16 age of or
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
older again as representative Derby said
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
to operate any boat over 24 25
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
horsepower in New Hampshire you have to
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
have your boating safety card and you
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
have to be 16 there is a provision in
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
the law that allows for a younger person
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
a child 12 14 50 whatever um to go along
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
to operate with a adult behind them
 
00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
according to that law that adult has to
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
take liability and responsibility for
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
that operator in essence when it was
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
passed and discussed and I think it was
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
200 something um it might have been
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
earlier than that it was about kind of
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
the culture of parents teaching kids how
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
to operate um so what we're saying here
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
is that the parent of the 12-year-old
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
can still learn to operate
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
that 25 foot center console in the Sea
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
Coast with a parent but you couldn't
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
have that parent teach their child about
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
how to operate a personal watercraft so
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
I guess my question would be if that's
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
an issue of of of allowing children to
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
be taught by parents or adults then we
 
00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
should look at that for all boats not
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
one particular type if we don't want
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
parents teaching kids if that's not the
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
culture that we want to promote then we
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
should take that away for all boats not
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
just personal water
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
craft the second letter B um talks about
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
not operating between sunset and sunrise
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
again there are no lights manufactured
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
on Persona
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
watercraft just like there are no lights
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
on other types of boats aluminum fishing
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
boats with a 30 horsepower engine on
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
them don't have lights either if we want
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
to ban aftermarket parts on boats that
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
are not manufactured with lights I'd
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
rather see that in a separate bill where
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
you talk about that for all boats not
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
one one particular type we have surveyed
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
our membership nobody nobody retrofits a
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
craft with lights there's too much
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
liability they do not do it the Marin is
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
have total list they're not doing that
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
they don't so it's somebody going to a
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
hardware store and getting the stick
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
them lights and putting them on but if
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
there is a whole page which I have here
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere of rules on the proper
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
equipment and lighting through our
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
safety rules um if we want to make sure
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
that nobody is doing that for any boat
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have lights on them that's
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
a discussion but I don't think you
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
should do it for just one
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
type c um is the issue about personal
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
flotation devices again I think what
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen and the data on the accident
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
statistics have shown that out of 26
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
accidents one had no life Fest and three
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
were unknown it's very common for people
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
to wear their life vest because again
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
they typically attach it's it's
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
something that's called best practices
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
um um very practically speaking people
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
vote responsibly and it's very rare to
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
see somebody without one again if you
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
want to have a discussion about
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory life jackets for all voters
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's a different discussion that's a
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
different Bill we'd ask you not to just
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
create it for this
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
craft finally there is the provisions
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
relative to careless and negligent
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
operation weaving in and out or swerving
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
at the last moment to avoid Collision I
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
would just note for this committee that
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
um we think it's overly
 
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
prescriptive um having just careless
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
negligent and Reckless operation on the
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
statutes is already there in fact this
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
legislature um revised those statutes
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
last year uh they just went into effect
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2025 there is a careless
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
negligent operation of boat statute
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
which was just adopted um it went
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
through criminal justice last year um
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's already on the books which also
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
have a reckless operation that is on the
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
book as of J 1 2025 they were there
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
before but they were modified last year
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
and they were passed so we think there's
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
existing laws to deal with folks who are
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
acting inappropriately again if you are
 
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:42.039 align:start position:0%
swerving or weaving through congested
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
traffic you're probably not don't have
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
150 ft distance on both side of the
 
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
craft if you're slam if you're stopping
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
before you hit somebody you're probably
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
again uh up against those um operation V
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
violations so lastly we would just say
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
the real issue here is enforcement of
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
our current laws um we think ensuring
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
adequate Marine Patrol is the best thing
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
um I started doing this work in 1995 I
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
think we had about 65 Marine Patrol
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
officers then um I remember wanting to
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully get us to 75 I think now we're
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
down to 25 that's the problem that's the
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
problem so um and I would just point out
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
that representative Derby has another
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
bill House Bill 397 seeking to address
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol Workforce issue and

01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
that so we do not support this
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislation because we do not think it's
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
necessary we think current laws cover it
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
and we're very concerned about that

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
to start off by saying thank you for
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
giving me the time today to explain why
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
I oppose House Bill
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
582 I recognize some of you from last
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
year when I came to oppose House Bill
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
1562 which changed the definition of PWC
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
and sought to ban and restrict them from
 
01:04:41.319 --> 01:04:42.470 align:start position:0%
and sought to ban and restrict them from
public

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
Waters this bill while it doesn't go as
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
far is something we don't believe we
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
need my family and I own multiple
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire through the pandemic we
 
01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
understood how important it was for
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation where people could
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
engage alone or within their Inner
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
Circle results from a recent Penn State
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
study indicate that nearly half of
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
adults from across the United States now
 
01:05:27.269 --> 01:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
participate in Recreation on at least a
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and approximately 20% may
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
be new to outdoor recreation during the
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
pandemic pwc's open the door for so many
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
families to get out on the water and
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
enjoy the beautiful state we live in and
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
participate in outdoor recreation people
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
have invested in purchasing pwc's
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
knowing their current classification as
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
boats they follow all the same rules and
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
regulations as other boats House Bill
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
582 would change that and treat them
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
like ski craft as you heard ski ccraft
 
01:05:58.029 --> 01:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
are very limited to the bodies of water
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
they can access we oppose a new
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
classification of personal
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
watercraft that they have been regulated
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
as boats for over 30 years and should
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be we do not want to open up
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
the year-long debates over access of
 
01:06:11.839 --> 01:06:13.390 align:start position:0%
the year-long debates over access of
these

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
watercraft um pwcs contribute to over
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
30% of new sail and boat registrations
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire we
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
reclassify pwc's The Next Step will be
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
attempted bans and restrictions like we
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
saw last
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
year that would result in a decline in
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
our sales and tourism there is no need
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
for this bill there is no need to
 
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
reclassify personal watercraft I spend
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
most of my spring summer and fall days
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
um out on the lakes of our state between
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
wiip to Arlington Pond Big Island
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
Pond and I can truthfully say I don't
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
see anybody operate as we've all said
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
without a p uh a life vest or uh PF
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
um as John already stated you know if I
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
grew up with my father and Uncle
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
bringing me out on watercrafts and me
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
driving them and they would put the
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
lanyard onto them compared to me having
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
the control um there would be seidu and
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
Yamaha and other manufacturers have
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
different modes for if you let somebody
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
operate the machine that should
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
not have as much experience it's called
 
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
a learning key or learning mode to limit
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
the speed so they don't have full power
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
as if I was just operating the Machine
 
01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
by myself um so as we've all said I do
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
think that uh there is no need to to
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
change the law um and please oppose
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
Sports good morning thank you for giving
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
us the opportunity to speak today
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
regarding HB 582 my name is Lisa miles
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
one of the owners of HK Powersports with
 
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
locations in hookset and lonia I live in
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
the town of Meredith on lake winaki and
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
I'm here to oppose HB
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
582 this proposed bill would change how
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh pwc's are regulated in the state of
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire today three passenger
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
watercraft which are 90% of the pwc's
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
that are sold and registered in New
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are classified and regulated
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
as boats and fall under all these laws
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
that I think are already
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
covered one and two passenger smaller
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
crafts are legally defined as ski craft
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and make up a very
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
small number I'd like to point out that
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
three-seater pwc's make up approximately
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
30% of new boat sales in New Hampshire
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
which is a significant amount pwc's are
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
popular because they are affordable low
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance easy to operate and easy to
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
transport and store most customers buy a
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft instead of a boat
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
because it's an affordable option to get
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
their family out on the lake others
 
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
purchase them for fishing visiting sandb
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
bars or restaurants Towing their kids on
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
tubes or teaching their kids how to
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
water ski pwc's are very safe and have
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
no risk of propeller injuries and are
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
easy to get in and out of the water on
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
in 2023 our stores alone sold over 600
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft to families to use
 
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire Lakes at an average
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
price of only around
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
14,000 changing our laws to create a new
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
definition of pwc's different than boats
 
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
is very troubling we had this debate
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
last year and this committee voted it
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
down this bill will reopen the debates
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
over bans and restrictions that we had
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
last year and that my parents also
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
fought for in the 90s we thought those
 
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
days were over but it seems that we are
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
rehashing out old debates it continues
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
to confuse our customers and the voting
 
01:09:54.159 --> 01:09:55.709 align:start position:0%
to confuse our customers and the voting
public

01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
finally we have not observed any Trend
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
and safety concerns that were discussed
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
by the sponsors in fact we observe
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
everyone on personal watercraft wearing
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
their life jackets whereas people
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
operating larger boats do not um I'd
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
like to also point out that although
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
I've never seen someone not wearing a
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
life jacket there's no space on a jet
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
ski or a three passenger to actually
 
01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
store life jackets so you have to wear
 
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.110 align:start position:0%
store life jackets so you have to wear
it

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
um when we sell personal watercraft we
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
always sell life jackets and obviously
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
tell people the importance and the laws
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
about wearing their personal flotation
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
device um as far as lights we absolutely
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
do not put lights on personal watercraft
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
they are not manufactured with them um
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
no one has even asked for us to add
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
lights to their personal watercraft so I
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
see that as a non-issue um to jod Point
 
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.709 align:start position:0%
 
situation

01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
um as far as what
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
um Jake and I think John said these
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
watercrafts are manufactured with um
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
restrictive keys so that people that are
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
learning how to drive them you put the
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
key or you put it in the mode where it
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
restricts the speed to
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
50% um
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
also because these are classified under
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
boats keep in mind that a 10 12y old can
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
also operate a 50 foot boat with their
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
parent on board versus a kid sitting in
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
front of their parent operating the ski
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
where their parents are right here if
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
anything happened they're also
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
manufactured with what the manufacturers
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
call brakes and although they are
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
different than Brakes in an automobile
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
you have a brake on The Handlebar so you
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
accelerate with one throttle and you
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
grab the other one and it it these
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
probably have the quickest stopping
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
power of any boat on that is
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured so um the manufacturers
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
take safety very seriously with creating
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
these um does anyone have any other
 
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
questions about personal watercraft any
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you for your
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%

yes we got that don't have names on them
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to know who they were
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%

closed thank you moving right or wrong
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
11 call the order the hearing on HB 595
 
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
FN relative to Coastal resilience zones
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
I have two pink cards here and neither
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
one appear to be any of his prime
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors is um representative Muse are
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
bill I am not the prime sponsor but I
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
can introduce the bill and hopefully
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
he'll get here oh is this the prime
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
here I have mine because I printed them
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
out which is why I said to
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
everybody my Clerk's going to check to
 
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
printed I'll
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
said no okay we're trying to see if we
 
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
can find your bill in print
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll repeat again I make or ask
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
our clerk to send out the agenda and all
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bills attached in one PDF so if you
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
bring your laptop like some of the
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
representatives do you should have them
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
on your laptop if not I kindly ask you
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have this question
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
about do we have the copies print them
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
out that gives you an opportunity to
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
read them in advance of the hearing too
 
01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
which isn't a bad idea right so that
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
would be nice and uh it does take her
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
time to ass simulate them and put them
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
together because we never did that in my
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
prior years on the committee um so I
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
want to thank uh our committee secretary
 
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
for doing that but let let's try to take
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of it that would be great and
 
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
now I'm getting passed around all the
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay so now I'm going to open the
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 595 FN relative to Coastal
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
resilience zones and she he's already at
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
the head table this is the prime sponsor
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
that will be introducing the bills
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative Ms representative thank
 
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and uh thank you members
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh for the record my
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
name is Chris muns I'm one of the four
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
state representatives along with
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative bridel from uh rockium
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
District 29 representing the town of
 
01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
Hampton I'm here to introduce HB
 
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
595 the title of the bill suggests that
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
its purpose is to create Coastal
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
resilience zones that is in fact what I
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
titled the LSR but as I worked to craft
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill I realized that
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
much of what I was suggesting applied as
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
much to the communities in the White
 
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
Mountains Lakes Region and managot
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
region as it does to Hampton and other
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
communities on the Sea
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
Coast the frequency of significant
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
weather events that result in flooding
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
and other damage has increased and will
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
continue to do so changes in our climate
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
and weather patterns is super charging
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
the water cycle leading to heavier
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
rainfall extremes across the country
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
including in New Hampshire a recent
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
study from Dartmouth College found that
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
events that will bring 1 and a half
 
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
inches or more of heavy rainfall or
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
melted snowfall in one day are
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
anticipated to increase 52% by the end
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
of the century a report prepared by the
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%

Estuary Alliance in May
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
2024 concluded that there is a
 
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
67% chance that sea levels will rise
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
between .3 and 7 ft by 2030 and 0.5 and
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
1.3 feet by
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
2050 attached to the copy of my written
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
testimony are pictures from the flooding
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
that occurred in Hampton in January
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
2023 and in the manad region in July of
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
2023 these weather events not only
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
resulted in millions of dollars of
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
Damages but disrupted the lives of
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds if not thousands of our fellow
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
citizens many of whom are constituents
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
of those of us in this room in the case
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
of many of Representative Bridal and my
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
constituents in Hampton it continues to
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
do so whenever there is an unusually
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
high tide or strong storm and is not the
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
large homes that face the ocean that
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
incur the damage the most damage it is
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
the smaller summer cottages purchased
 
01:18:27.149 --> 01:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
years ago and handed down through
 
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
generations and that have but the marsh
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
that are most
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
affected if sea levels rise by one foot
 
01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
it will affect approximately 1750 homes
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
in Seabrook Hampton and Hampton Falls
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
the estimated assessed value of those
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
properties is approximately $450
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
million if 10% of those properties were
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
lost due to storm damage Not only would
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
the owners of those properties
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
properties suffer significant loss but
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of us in cra Hampton and
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
Hampton Falls would have to make up the
 
01:18:57.639 --> 01:18:59.270 align:start position:0%
Hampton Falls would have to make up the

higher insurance rates that many of us
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire will have to pay to

be testifying in favor of this bill and

will share some thoughts on how such a

complete a Statewide analysis of the

cost of flood risk and the cost and

benefits of flood risk mitigation
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
given the impact revealed in the study

completed for seab Brook Hampton and
 
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
Hampton Falls it seems prudent and
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate that the state assess what
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
those risks are the goal is that such a
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
study will help to inform and guide
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
policy makers in additional actions that
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
should be taken this bill provides for
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
an additional appropriation to the Bea

with the understanding that any such
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation will be offset by any
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
available fed ederal or private grants
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
the department may be able to
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
identify while I cannot say whether they
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
support the bill I do want to thank the
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners of the Departments of
 
01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:36.440 align:start position:0%

01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
help in drafting this bill since the
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced they and other
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including the New Hampshire
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association the Sara club and
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
quite frankly some members of this
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
committee have offered additional
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
comments and suggestions
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
and I thank them as well I encourage the
 
01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
committee to consider all of their
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
suggestions I will summarize what they
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
are now but in my written testimony I
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
have included specific language for an
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
amendment I am happy to work with you to
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
adopt first since the proposed Municipal
 
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
flood resilience fee will be collected
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
as an additional assessment on the
 
01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
assessed value of all property and
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
collected along with the general
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%

providing a variety of other benefits

including cleaner water reduced erosion
 
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
and cleaner air it also often is more
 
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
cost effective and longer lasting than
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
other forms of flood control such as
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
seaw walls and raising built structures
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
as such the Sierra Club suggests
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
amending the definition of flood of a
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
flood resiliency Improvement to include
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
improvements of that type and I support
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
that third is introduced the language
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
defining the scope of the Statewide
 
01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
economic studies suggests that it must
 
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
include all flood prone properties which
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
would be timeconsuming and like unlikely
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
to be completed even with a budget of
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
$500,000 it also is probably not
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
necessary given that significant Insight
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
can be gleaned from representative
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
samples Bea has proposed some amended
 
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
language which I which I agree with that
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
will reduce the scope to something that
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
is more manageable and can hopefully
 
01:25:39.109 --> 01:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
provide meaningful insight to guide
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%

01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
Additionally the legislation requires a
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
confirmation of terms phone call that
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
takes place with the homeowner and
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
provides that no assessment can exceed
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
exceed 20% of the home's value among
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
other consumer
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
protections the municipal Association
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
alerted me to a bill
 
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
sb4 that has already passed the Senate
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
and had a hearing in the house science
 
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday I understand that the
 
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
municipal Association worked very
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
closely with the New Hampshire business
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority to craft this bill and
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
that is it is on a fast track to be
 
01:27:04.109 --> 01:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
submitted to the house for final
 
01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
approval and to the governor for her
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
signature it updates RSA chapter 53f and
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
among among other things designates the
 
01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire business Finance Authority
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
as the administrator of the commercial
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
cace program there's no reason I can
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
think of that the rpce program I am
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
proposing in my bill couldn't also be
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
introduced by the B by the
 
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
BFA I will of course defer to the this
 
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
committee on the best course of action
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
but if sb4 is signed into law and HB 595
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
is amended were to pass the house I
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
would certainly be work willing to work
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
with you and members of the Senate to
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
further modify the language in the final
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill so that so that it is consistent
 
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.350 align:start position:0%
bill so that so that it is consistent
with

01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%

and would also certainly be willing to
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
participate in a subcommittee if you
 
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
choose to designate one thank you any
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ms for taking my question
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh is pretty comprehensive
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh like you just went through thanks for
 
01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.390 align:start position:0%
uh like you just went through thanks for
that

01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
explanation um
 
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
I am um I've mentioned to you offline uh
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
my concerns about uh our pace and um
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
like you mentioned uh Florida has passed
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
passed an additional additional
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to um provide consumer
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
protections regarding our PA so I wonder
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
if it might be appropriate to bring
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
everything else forward because it's
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
build has a lot other than the rpce
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
changes and then um allow for a
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
subsequent bill that um def provides uh
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive protections for uh for
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
residents uh to engage in our Pace
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
because this is our Pace in this bill is
 
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
going to extend it Beyond um uh flood
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
resiliency to all um energy all the
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
energy programs that are supported by
 
01:29:16.239 --> 01:29:18.790 align:start position:0%
energy programs that are supported by
cpce

01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
today um I I obviously would like to see
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know our Pace move forward as part
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
of this just so that we we start to give
 
01:29:28.679 --> 01:29:29.350 align:start position:0%
of this just so that we we start to give
uh

01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
homeowners um another another mechanism
 
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
to finance any improvements they that
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
they wish but um I understand what
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying um and if um you know the
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
decision of the committee is to carve
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
the rpce out for now and move forward
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the bill then I um I I
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
don't think I would have any strong
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
objections to that and be happy to work
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
on putting together an rpce bill um for
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
the for next
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
year anyone
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
else seeing none thank you for your
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
testimony speaking in favor
 
01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:19.229 align:start position:0%
testimony speaking in favor
representative

01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
my name is representative David Muse I
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
represent the city of Portsmouth and the
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
towns of Newington and Newcastle and uh
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at a map uh one of the
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
things you can see pretty quickly is
 
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
that uh I represent a pretty fair chunk
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Sea Coast so Wards
 
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
1 and Wards 5 and Portsmouth basically
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
have about
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
95% of the uh the land area the coastal
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
land area and in Portsmouth uh Newcastle
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
is an island
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh and Newington uh borders on Great Bay
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
um this is an this is an area I think of
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
tremendous concern uh to people in my
 
01:31:07.149 --> 01:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
community and and all up and down the
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast a lot of people have
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
invested uh their time uh their money in
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
not only in uh in purchasing the
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
properties properties that they own
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
along the Sea Coast but I know in
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
Newcastle there are people uh who have
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh who have gotten approval to do
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
projects um uh to do things like build
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
seaw walls uh there are folks who have
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
raised their houses uh as we're talking
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
about in this bill um these are things
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
that are basically happening now and and
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that we
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
realize is that we may be one big storm
 
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:48.280 align:start position:0%
away from a lot of people not being able
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
to afford insurance anymore on their
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
homes or we might even start to see uh
 
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
what's happened in Florida and some
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
other places where some homes just
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
simply become become uninsurable because
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
of where they are um we're also seeing a
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
fair amount of uncertainty at the
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
federal level around just how much
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
Disaster Response Aid is going to
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
continue to be available in situations
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
like this so given the lack of
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
predictability at the federal level the
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
fact that uh Insurance may not be the
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
may not offer the kind of protection
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
that it's offered homeowners in the past
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that jumps out
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
to me about this bill is it lets people
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
and communities protect
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
themselves um it's an it's an enablement
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
Bill what it does is it gives
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
communities like Portsmouth
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
Newcastle uh Durham do all of the uh the
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
communities that board bordered the Sea
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
Coast Title estuaries and as
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative buns was saying also
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
flood plone areas and other parts of the
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
state it gives people the ability to do
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
something to protect their property uh
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
and it and it helps them band together
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
in a way that they might not be able to
 
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
do uh without legislation like this so I
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
would ask you to please strongly uh
 
01:33:15.149 --> 01:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
consider this legislation to work with
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ms I've worked with him
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
on a bunch of other bills uh in my
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
committee and and we found he's always
 
01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
receptive to conversation to changes to
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
good ideas uh he's a great
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative to work with on something
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
like this and we need to get something
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
done in this area um thank you very much
 
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:37.960 align:start position:0%

01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%

here today in strong support of House
Bill

01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
595 I am not on a list of a sponsor
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
which is fine but I after I listened to
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
representative muns some of his emails
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
and talking about this I feel I wanted
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
to jump on to show my support and to
 
01:34:23.109 --> 01:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
emphasize to this committee that this is
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
just isn't just a Sea Coast issue is an
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
issue for a lot of the communities I
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
represent in the western part of the
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
state Sullivan County including Cen and
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
aworth Newport planfield among others
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
because these communities over the last
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
few years have been devastated by some
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
floods caused to uh heavy rains that hit
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh those communities I remember the date
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
I know July of
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
2023 was and then I think last year
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
there were also Heavy R
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
and especially for communities like Cen
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
aworth who are only 800 residents you
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
know their roads were devastated uh
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
their Pro property was damaged I believe
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
it really caused a lot of damage which
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
they they're having to deal with they
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
had to go try to go through FEMA and
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're having problems with FEMA uh and
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
I and I feel that we do also need to do
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
more this is an abling legislation that
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
would help communities hopefully prevent
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
tragedies you know from occurring the
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
floods the damages and I think we got to
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
do more to prevent damage caused by
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events We Can't Stop
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
Those events or totally prevent them but
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
we got to take some measures I think I
 
01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
think it's government's duty to try to
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh increase Public Safety and limit
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
people's property damage and I think
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
this is great enabling legislation that
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
would do that and I commend
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative muns for doing this but I
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
want to say it it's again emphasized
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's not just a Sea Coast issue it's an
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
issue for communities all across that
 
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
including the communities I uh represent
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
which are over in the western part of
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
the state and the Vermont border because
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of rivers okay thank you
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%

01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%

like to highlight for you the support of
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
the city of Portsmouth for this bill
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is signed in supporting it um I'm
 
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
a city councelor in Portsmouth and I am
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
here to emphasize that support the city
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth estimates that 500
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
properties in Portsmouth are at risk of
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
flood in the historic district not only
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
does this flooding impact those Property
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
Owners but it also impacts the Integrity
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
of our downtown historic district which
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
is a major draw for
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
tourism we are working to try to support
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
our property owners who are imp impacted
 
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
by regular flooding this bill allows for
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
localities to better develop resources
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
to address improvements needed due to
 
01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.830 align:start position:0%
to address improvements needed due to
that

01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
flooding in my personal capacity I would
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
like to highlight the immediate
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
challenges of many of my neighbors and
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
the benefits of this bill when it comes
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
to preparedness our residents are facing
 
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
significant challenges with the cost of
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
property improvements addressing what
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
has become annual flooding in the winter
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
with rising ocean levels combined with
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
strong winter storms from my personal
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
experience I've witnessed the increasing
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
number of winter storms in flooding
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
impacting my immediate neighbors I live
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
adjacent to Mechanic Street in
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth one of the areas of
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth that floods regularly my
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
neighbors and businesses such as goo's
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
Chowder on Mechanic Street have had to
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
regularly replace Mechanicals and
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
interior fixtures due to flooding this
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
places considerable Financial strain on
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
these Property Owners many of whom have
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
lived and worked in these locations
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
their entire lives these homes and
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
businesses are not only part of the
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
fabric of our community but they are
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
also part of the early Heritage of the
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire the Wentworth
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
Gardener home a historic treasur sits on
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
Mechanic Street I should also mention
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
that Prescott Park and strawberry Bank
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
are also regularly impacted by this
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
flooding that directly harms the
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
Prescott Park Arts Festival gundo

strawberry Bank Museum these nonprofits
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
are part of the vibrant cultural
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
community that drives tourism in our
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
region House Bill 595 helps Property
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
Owners address the critical improvements
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
needed for flooding mitigation and
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
Recovery I ask you to support House Bill
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
595 to help Property Owners become
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
become more resilient in the face of
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
this growing challenge thank you thank
 
01:39:00.589 --> 01:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
you any questions for the
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
speaker representative
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm on the select
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
board in stratum so I'm going to ask you
 
01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
sort of a municipal question since
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
you're here as a municipal
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative um the piece about the
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
flood resilience investment funds um we
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
did this in stratum with the
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
transportation funds but the way of
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
applying that is to benefit the town and
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
and you know large groups in the town
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a little concerned about those funds
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
and how they might just benefit an
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
individual or a business and I wonder
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
how you think about you would think
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
about applying those in your city to
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
avoid sort of this this is we're going
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
to give all this money to this one
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
person to fix up their house or how that
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
would how that would play out thank you
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
so much for your question this is not a
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had yet at the
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
municipal level in Portsmith um I would
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity for us to have
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
that discussion which we can't have
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
concurrently because we don't have this
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place um currently um the
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
way we address the only way that we can
 
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
address um challenges we have around
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is through um taxation on
 
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
our residents and we do have a lot of
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure challenges due to
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
flooding and so we're looking at having
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
to mitigate those in the long term but
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to even have a
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
discussion around how we support um not
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
only businesses and homeowners um but
 
01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
how we um deal with kind of these
 
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
mechanisms because they don't exist
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
right now I would I would welcome that
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and I would say that I think
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities are well positioned to um
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
make critical decisions that um would
 
01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.629 align:start position:0%
make critical decisions that um would
benefit

01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
benefit

members of the committee for the record
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
my name is DJ beton Court I have the
 
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
pleasure of serving as the commissioner
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire insurance
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
department it's nice to see all of you I
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
don't get to come to many committees
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
outside of house Commerce and ways and
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
means so it's good to see some different
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
faces I wanted to provide you with a
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
little bit of background obviously from
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
an insurance perspective more broadly
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
speaking I'm not going to tell you that
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'm intimately familiar with every
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
detail of this particular proposal but
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
what I can say is that we are certainly
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
aware of the challenges that your
 
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:32.679 align:start position:0%
constituents Granite stators who are
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
living in the Sea Coast and in other
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
areas of our state are having with
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
accessibility and affordability of
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance coverage and I will
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh divert for a moment to say that since
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
this particular proposal is focused on
 
01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
flood one of the most important public
 
01:41:52.589 --> 01:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
service announcements that I could give
 
01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
as commissioner and that is to make it
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
clear at any time at any opportunity you
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
have with your constituents to make them
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
aware that they do not have flood
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
coverage unless they've purchased a
 
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
separate flood insurance policy either
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
through the commercial Market or through
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
the federal flood insurance program it
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
is not covered under your underlying
 
01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.070 align:start position:0%
is not covered under your underlying
homeowners

01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
01:42:21.589 --> 01:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
insurance representative cluer spoke
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
about an incident in the summer of 2023
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
I remember that incident incredibly well
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
it was my first week as commissioner
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
there was a horrible flood uh I've been
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
in public service in one form or fashion
 
01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years it was by far the
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
worst set of conversations that I have
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
ever had to have with members of the
 
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
public because they had just lost their
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
home in some of uh these instances that
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
lost everything and they were calling me
 
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
to get a better understanding of what
 
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
coverage they had under their homeowners
 
01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.589 align:start position:0%
coverage they had under their homeowners
insurance

01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
policy to which my response was you
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
don't have any and so these people were
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the prospect of having to
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
rebuild their entire lives without
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
having any coverage or any support from
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
their insurance carrier so that was
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
obviously quite difficult and quite
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
tragic for those individuals so I say
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
that as a bit of a public service
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
announcement for all of you but getting
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
back to the insurance piece as it
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
pertains to this
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
proposal we are aware that se Coast
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
residents and others as I've said are
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
having a hard time with accessibility
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
and affordability to coverage couple of
 
01:43:36.589 --> 01:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
different reasons for that right now the
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
health the insurance industry as a whole
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
is working through what we would
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
classify as a hard Market hard Market is
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
an insurance term which means that the
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are more tightly
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
managing their risk they are putting
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
forward more stringent underwriting
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
criteria so they're
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
narrowing their offerings so when
 
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
coverages are at traditional demand
 
01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
levels or higher but the accessibility
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
to those coverages is more restricted
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
you have a basic Supply demand dynamic
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
takehold in which what is left of that
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
coverage is obviously now more
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
expensive why are the insurance carriers
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
managing their risks more judiciously
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
number of reasons for that some of which
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
are well known to the public things like
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
inflation things like interest rates
 
01:44:34.589 --> 01:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
things like disruption to Global Supply
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
chains certainly the supply chains are
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
better than where they were during the
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic and in the immediate aftermath
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic but they're not back to
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels yet so those things
 
01:44:48.589 --> 01:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
are obviously drivers of upward pressure
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
on premiums but those are things that
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
are cyclical in some event in some
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
instances and So eventually those
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
factors will
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
Abate things that we're going to have to
 
01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
contend with on a permanent or more
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
long-term basis are things that are also
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
driving this hard market like
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophic weather events that are
 
01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
becoming more severe and more frequent
 
01:45:15.629 --> 01:45:15.639 align:start position:0%
think the Hurricanes that wipe out
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
Florida or the Gulf Coast or the
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
Carolinas think of the horrific fire
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
that we just saw in Los Angeles uh those
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
are huge events that result in insurance
 
01:45:31.589 --> 01:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
carriers having to pay out a lot of
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
money those are huge losses for those
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
companies and the fact that we have a
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
lot of Technology that's coming online
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
in our cars and in our homes and the
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
vast majority of that technology is
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
great because it's all safety oriented
 
01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
and we want that but it is expensive the
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
technology itself is expensive the
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
expertise to install or repair and
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
replace that technology
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
requires um an individual who's going to
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
cost more to do that work to come out
 
01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:03.639 align:start position:0%
and do that repair work or to install
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
that particular or reinstall that
 
01:46:07.629 --> 01:46:07.639 align:start position:0%
particular piece of technology in your
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
home or car when it breaks so all of
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
that has come together to uh create a
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
hard market for consumers and so they're
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
seeing as I've said increases in
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
premiums they're seeing
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
non-renewals and this is particularly
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
pronounced in those problematic areas in
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast and in the other areas
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
that you've heard referenced today so I
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
will say that as a broad matter again
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not intimately familiar with every
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
provision of this proposal I suspect
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
there going to be some areas you'll want
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
to think about and work over but what I
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that the spirit of this
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
program is a good one because it will
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
better position consumers in the
 
01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
underwriting process when they are
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get homeowners insurance
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
coverage or get their current homeowners
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage
 
01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
renewed that they themselves or their
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
Community have taken a number of steps
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
to make that property make that home
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
more resilient so that God forbid there
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
should be a flood event the damage to
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
that home is going to be less it will be
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
mitigated and so the hope is that
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
because of that work because of those
 
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
improvements as that consumer goes
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
through the underwriting process with
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
whomever is quoting them
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
on their coverage they'll be in a better
 
01:47:28.589 --> 01:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
place and so they'll get at least the
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
offer for Renewal with their current
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
carrier and not kicked into the Surplus
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
lines Market which is a very expensive
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
Market to get coverage uh or not only
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
will they be renewed but they'll have a
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
lower premium quoted to them than they
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
had before as a result of this work so
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
we are as I've said uh in a place where
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
we look favorably towards proposals like
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
this the department is actually bringing
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
forward a separate program that's more
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
widely applicable but these are the
 
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
types of things that I think all of us
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
need to have a thorough conversation
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
around in terms of how are we going to
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
deal with the fact that we cannot
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
obviously control the weather but the
 
01:48:16.589 --> 01:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
weather is having a huge impact on our
 
01:48:18.669 --> 01:48:18.679 align:start position:0%
constituents in a number of different
 
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
ways and for the insurance aspect of it
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
we think programs like this
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
can be potentially very very helpful so
 
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
with that Mr chairman I'll hand it back
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
over to you any questions for the
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
speaker a bunch representative Darby
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
then representative NAB uh thank you Mr
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
um we've heard uh in California that
 
01:48:44.910 --> 01:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
there's a sort of the state provides a
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
high-risk Market pool for you know for
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
those areas that um traditional insurers
 
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
won't cover anymore plan um does does
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have something like that
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not have a fair plan
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you that I am not a fan
 
01:49:01.229 --> 01:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
of fair plans for a couple of different
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
reasons the first
 
01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
is in California's case the program is
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
horribly administered they can't
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
properly process claims the customer
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
service is terrible I don't know what on
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
Earth they're going to do as a result of
 
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
this horrific wildfire in Los Angeles
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
California's in a bit of a a bit of a
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
bad place with their insurance Market at
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
the present time a lot of different
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
reasons for that um FAIR Plan the idea
 
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:35.719 align:start position:0%
of a fair plan is that when there is no
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
other insurer that will take you you
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
have a fallback position it's a insurer
 
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
of Last Resort so to speak uh and the
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
problem is that it doesn't always work
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
that way um in Massachusetts for example
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
the fair plan is the preferred option of
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
people in Massachusetts because they've
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
Juiced the subsidies in that program
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
such that it's completely undercut their
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
commercial market and everybody just
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
wants to go to the fair plan as a
 
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental matter two things first is I
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe that New Hampshire needs
 
01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
it we have a very competitive
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
marketplace right now we have over 200
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
players who are writing coverage for
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
homeowners in auto insurance in New
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there's more than adequate
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
competition I don't think that we should
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
take dramatic steps in a difficult
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
cycle I think we have to see where this
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
cycle ultimately brings us before we
 
01:50:34.589 --> 01:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
take dramatic steps that could
 
01:50:34.599 --> 01:50:35.950 align:start position:0%
take dramatic steps that could
permanently

01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
01:50:38.669 --> 01:50:38.679 align:start position:0%
disrupt the competitive industry that we
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
have at present now obviously if the
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
current conditions extend out over a
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
number of years well then it's going to
 
01:50:47.069 --> 01:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
be time for us to come back together and
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
start weighing options and thinking
 
01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
about what other tools we need to bring
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
to bear to deal with that but I I don't
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
think that we're there yet and again as
 
01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
a fundamental matter I get very very
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable when you are talking about
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%
making government an active player in an
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise privatized Market governments
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
just have advantages that the private
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
sector does not most glaringly you know
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
if a an insurance company makes a series
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
of bad decisions they've got two choices
 
01:51:20.109 --> 01:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
they can either make adjustments to
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
right siiz their operation or they can
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
go out of
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
business government never goes out of
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
business we'll just go get more money
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
and so because of that permanency of the
 
01:51:33.629 --> 01:51:33.639 align:start position:0%
government being a player in that
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
Dynamic where the other players are not
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
they're obviously held to a different
 
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
set of factors and standards and
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
considerations I I think the disruption
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
to again our otherwise competitive
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
market um we just would not be benefited
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
by a fair plan representative na
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
you're all set any other questions from
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
Mr beton Court one
 
01:52:00.669 --> 01:52:00.679 align:start position:0%
more thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
the question uh would wind and or fire
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh damage be Nally covered by homeowners
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
or not uh yes so I always say this
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
you've got to read your policy to make
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
sure you know exactly what's in there uh
 
01:52:19.229 --> 01:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
but typically the standard is if it is
 
01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
an incident that is sudden and
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
accidental it should be covered as a as
 
01:52:26.589 --> 01:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
a broad matter Christian is that right
 
01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:29.719 align:start position:0%
yeah yep broad broadly speaking U fire
 
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
for sure fire for sure and wind yeah
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
wind would be
 
01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
covered anything else from Mr baton
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
Court saying none thank you very much
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I have one more pink
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
card in favor Marcus Landers I believe
 
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
he passed out some written testimony
 
01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:55.790 align:start position:0%
he passed out some written testimony
also

01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.030 --> 01:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Landers for speaking if if
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
you don't mind me saying I would hope
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're not going to read line for line
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
your written testimony uh if you want to
 
01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:05.719 align:start position:0%
paraphrase it since everybody has it and
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
we're running behind in our hearings
 
01:53:09.629 --> 01:53:09.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate it absolutely I'll shorten it
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
up a little bit but um Mr chairman and
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak today for the
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
record my name is Marcus Landers I'm a
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%

School graduate and I've worked as a
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
general contractor here in the in the

granite state flood proofing homes for a
 
01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
few years now beyond my work in
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
construction uh I research and advocate
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
for flood resilience as a veteran fellow
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
at uh the Hoover institution and my
 
01:53:31.950 --> 01:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
mission is to protect America from the
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
accelerating threat of natural hazards
 
01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
particularly flood New Hampshire has a
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
ton of risk right now and according to
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
the First Street Foundation which is a
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
leading risk modeling firm floting
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
threatens right now 60,000 New Hampshire
 
01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
properties worth tens of billions of
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
dollars without action over the next
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
three decades um New Hampshire could
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
face billions of property damage
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
storm surge alone threatens a quarter of
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
the properties in the Sea Coast but this
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
is a Statewide issue and plal flooding
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
threatens communities in luconia and all
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
the way up to the northern most Rees of
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
the state destruction of value begins
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
long before the waters rise however
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
without investments in resilience
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance markets will begin to price in
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
risk driving premiums to unsustainable
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
levels insurers are now fleeing disaster
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
prone markets in Florida California and
 
01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
even in coua New Jersey where I grew up
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
leaving homeowners without affordable
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
coverage as insurance becomes scarce the
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
mortgage Market also tends to dry up the
 
01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
result is a downward spiry where home
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
values will plummet because no one can
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
buy or sell real estate not due to
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
actual floods but to the due to the
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
anticipation of one looming devaluation
 
01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
threatens the broader New Hampshire
 
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
economy as Pro declining property values
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
affect the tax base and the funds
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
essential to essential services like
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
schools and law enforcement no one know
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
exactly when this tipping Point's going
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
to come but history suggests that
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
markets correct they do so efficient
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
efficiency L and swiftly and if the the
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
crisis fully manifest it will be too
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
late to prevent the economic collapse in
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
vulnerable regions and also the broader
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
State economy that's why this is a
 
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide issue the danger is clear on
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
paper and there there are reason and if
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
you look at an Excel spreadsheet it
 
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
seems why wouldn't people invest there
 
01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
are a couple of things and moral
 
01:55:11.709 --> 01:55:11.719 align:start position:0%
hazardous elements of the market that
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
are creating bad incentives first is
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
that insurance for flood insurance is
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
subsidized and that's creating broken
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
pricing signals both for th those
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance markets and for home
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
prices homeowners have a false sense of
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
security uh because their their
 
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
insurance is naturalized like we
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned before about a fa plan this is
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
offered through FEMA and the Legacy
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
rates don't reflect risk second home
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
owners expect the government to come in
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
and provide disaster relief creating
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
perverse incentive not to act before the
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
storm if you talk to homeowners in
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
Florida after mil Milton and Hela you
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
would they would discount this
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
expectation as Federal coffers are
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
stretched thinner and thinner by more
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
disasters lastly resilience retrofits
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
are often cost prohibitive I've worked
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
as a structural lifting contractor in
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
this state it it hovers between $150 and
 
01:55:57.629 --> 01:55:57.639 align:start position:0%
$200,000 to drisk your home for that
 
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
specific retrofit banks are not lending
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
because the there's not a a resultant
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
value add to the home value because of
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
these perverse incentives and in a
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
higher interest rate environment like we
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
currently have seeking outside capital
 
01:56:11.069 --> 01:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
is particularly
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
expensive the National Institute of
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
building Sciences has proven that every
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
dollar spent on flood frud protection
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
saves taxpayers $7 in post post flood
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
recovery HB 595 can Pioneer the methods
 
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
to increase homeowners the homeowners
 
01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
and private sector's share of each
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
dollar invested such they can
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately capture their share of the
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
$7 saved so expanding cpce and rpce
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
funding creates more viable financing
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
options that are cheaper for the
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
homeowner offering tax incentives can
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
correct the bad incentives that we spoke
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
to before creating flood resilience
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
zones can can empower the community to
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
act on their own accord and this study
 
01:56:48.589 --> 01:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
will prove that this is an investment
 
01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
and not just fiscal wanting fiscal
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
spending that there is some value Val
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
add to doing this this bill embodies the
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's tradition of local
 
01:56:58.510 --> 01:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
control and fiscal responsibility and it
 
01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
does not mandate heavy-handed government
 
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
intervention but provides a nudge for
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
the for the private Market to correct to
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
correct itself and and catalyze private
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
investment FEA which in my experience is
 
01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
staed by faint patriotic and diligent
 
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
people does not have the resources the
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to save New Hampshire Federal
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
flood mitigation funds are already
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
highly competitive and the Trump
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
Administration has in has implicated
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
that they want states to take more
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the Emergency
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
Management and preparedness and while
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's new Emergency Management
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
emergency and flood plane managers are
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
exceptionally capable and diligent
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
people they cannot mobilize or or raise
 
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
the capital necessary to solve this
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
issue on their own this is where the
 
01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
free market capitalized this bill must
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
step into this void in the
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
void in a perfect world this bird Bill
 
01:57:43.069 --> 01:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
provides incentive Corrections creating
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
foundation for an expanded public
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
private partnership and the non-aps
 
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
investment resilience investment fund
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
will play a crucial role acting as seed
 
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
Capital to demonstrate the the viability
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
of flood resilience
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
financing H HB 595 is not spending it is
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
about investing in New Hampshire to
 
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
present for the present and the future
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
and creating the conditions for the
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
private sector to act if you pass this
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
bill we will take the first step in
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
proving that smart policy can correct
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
broken incentives and make New Hampshire
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
a leader in resilience and Market driven
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
climate adaptation thank you for your

the history of the hbac I would just
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
like to add that uh in that require in
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
the requirement from the state is is to
 
02:03:56.589 --> 02:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
update the master plan every 10 years um
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the past few years we have begun that
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
process and in uh 2016 we completed the
 
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
transportation component of the master
 
02:04:08.430 --> 02:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
plan and most recently uh we've
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
completed the environmental and Coastal
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
resilience uh portions of the uh master
 
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
plan and turned that in as well and
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
after turning in each of the components
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
we take them to the Hampton planning
 
02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
board and get them adopted within the
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hampton uh master plan as well so it's
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.109 --> 02:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
itself excuse me um basically the uh
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
hbac holds um eight to nine meetings a
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
year and sometimes additional sub
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
commmittee meetings as as well there are
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
nine members of the commission uh
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
identified by this uh the legislature
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
must serve on that
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
commission and over the past few years
 
02:04:59.549 --> 02:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
we have had small fundraisers to raise
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
some money to pay for uh someone to take
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
the minutes of the meeting because um
 
02:05:08.910 --> 02:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
Lifestyles have changed since 20 2003
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
and people who serve on committees don't
 
02:05:12.669 --> 02:05:12.679 align:start position:0%
always have extra time to do extra
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
duties so we found it most important to
 
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
have someone specifically dedicated to
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
minutes and since the commission was um
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
organized in um 2003 we have taken the
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
minutes the agendas and the minutes and
 
02:05:31.709 --> 02:05:31.719 align:start position:0%
the documents from 2003 to
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
2016 and put them into a bound copies
 
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
that that are stored in the town uh
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
Library there so that people can go to
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
look at them for re uh research or easy
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
accessibility and we're currently in the
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
process of taking the minutes uh uh and
 
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh up through 2024 and having some more
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
bound copies made so that anyone looking
 
02:05:59.790 --> 02:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
at what has been going on uh in the
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
commission can can find that
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
easily there's still one more uh section
 
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
of um master plan to be updated and that
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
is the business and economic uh uh
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
component of the of the plan and that
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
will start as soon as we can find a
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
grant to help cover those costs because
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
what we have done in the past is always
 
02:06:26.109 --> 02:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
seek grants to bring in Professionals in
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
the area to uh make sure our master plan
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
is current and effective and easy enough
 
02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:34.109 align:start position:0%
is current and effective and easy enough
to

02:06:34.109 --> 02:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
follow uh the uh commission has also
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
been active in the um most recent uh
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
repair to the uh well actually
 
02:06:46.549 --> 02:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
replacement of the Hampton river bridge
 
02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
and we have been very active uh as the
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
state moves forward to reconstruct route
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
1A uh specifically for flooding issues
 
02:06:59.549 --> 02:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
that's a big concern of many of the
 
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
people that live uh in in that area and
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
as we know uh uh grants are great but
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
you can't really find a grant for
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
operating costs and so um on my exit
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
from the Hampton Beach area commission
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh we have been asked um to seek other
 
02:07:23.069 --> 02:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
alternatives to help support that and an
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
analysis of those costs has been about
 
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
$5,000 a year and I'm thankful to the
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
representatives for putting that bill
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
forward um and hopefully that you will
 
02:07:36.910 --> 02:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
accept that and uh we can continue our
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
our work because the commission does do
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of work they are really an advise
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
and consent to both the state and the
 
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:45.760 align:start position:0%

02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:49.960 align:start position:0%

amerck Hampton Beach thank you Mr chair
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Tracy emri I am the newly
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
mted chair of the Hampton Beach area
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
commission I've attended two me meetings
 
02:09:55.149 --> 02:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm not so I'm not all uh
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about everything it does
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
but I do know that we don't have any
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
funds to
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
communicate in Hampton we have a as
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
other communities do that have
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
Recreation we have a Confluence of state
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
and local jurisdictions that overlap so
 
02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
the Hampton area Beach commission has
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
acted as a lubricant if you will to make
 
02:10:19.549 --> 02:10:19.559 align:start position:0%
everybody happy and to have the various
 
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
egos get along with each other that's my
 
02:10:23.790 --> 02:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
observation in talking to past members
 
02:10:26.589 --> 02:10:26.599 align:start position:0%
of the of this commission uh one of the
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
things I identified early on is we we
 
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
have a meeting every month that is
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
televised in the on the local channel
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
but beyond that we don't have any funds
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
to update our website the current
 
02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
website was developed in 2006 and other
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
than changing participants on the
 
02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
committee it has not been updated since
 
02:10:49.549 --> 02:10:49.559 align:start position:0%
then so it and today in today's world
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
most people look to the web as as
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
information resource so that's why we
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
requested representative Ms to put in
 
02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
this bill so we'd have at least enough
 
02:11:00.189 --> 02:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
funds to update the website about what's
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
going on because there's a lot going on
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
one of the most interesting uh issues
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
right now is the fact that the uh
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation is redoing
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
Ocean Boulevard which is 1A and there's
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
a there's a an issue about the sidewalk
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
who owns a sidewalk so that's unresolved
 
02:11:21.669 --> 02:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
right now uh but that's part of our is
 
02:11:24.189 --> 02:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
to get in the middle of that and help
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
that move forward that's kind of I'm
 
02:11:28.750 --> 02:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
looking at that as a very immediate plan
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
because that after 15 years uh Ocean
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
Boulevard is going to is scheduled for
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
its final hearing next summer to be
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
upgraded so that being said I would
 
02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you uh having a positive vote
 
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
for 607 uh so that we might be able to
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
communicate with our community I'll be
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%

rivers of which there are 19 in the

providing needed
 
03:09:34.990 --> 03:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
resources for the local advisory

committee brings to the oversight of our

River and this can be extrapolated
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
across the state the impetus for this
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
idea was raised in one of our committee
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%

03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
dimensions but always involves a
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
detailed review of and comment on all
 
03:10:33.070 --> 03:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
proposed changes taking place within the
 
03:10:36.190 --> 03:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
river Corridor our comments while
 
03:10:38.670 --> 03:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
advisory are generally welcomed and
 
03:10:41.309 --> 03:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the proposed projects
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
lac's also conduct a wide range of
 
03:10:45.790 --> 03:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
educational monitoring and community
 
03:10:48.830 --> 03:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
activities for the betterment of our
 
03:10:51.309 --> 03:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
Rivers uh in terms of why the fundings
 
03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
needed so when the when the LA's were
 
03:10:56.070 --> 03:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
first established they could access
 
03:10:58.190 --> 03:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
funds which primarily came from the
 
03:11:01.389 --> 03:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
epa's 60 sorry
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
604b uh grant program um what's happened
 
03:11:06.670 --> 03:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
since then is those funds have become
 
03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
much harder to obtain and they've really
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
been prioritized to other purposes so
 
03:11:13.790 --> 03:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
they're largely not available for that
 
03:11:16.590 --> 03:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
function anymore uh this is greatly
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
impacted degree to which the lac's can
 
03:11:20.429 --> 03:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
fulfill their
 
03:11:23.630 --> 03:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
legislatively uh established Mission um
 
03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of what these funds might
 
03:11:30.830 --> 03:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
support um a a brief list of things that
 
03:11:34.750 --> 03:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
that uh lac's conduct um uh there's a
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
good deal of administrative support that
 
03:11:40.870 --> 03:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
is needed um my committee has a a a
 
03:11:43.070 --> 03:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
person that we hire from our uh
 
03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Planning Commission um for
 
03:11:49.870 --> 03:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
$2,000 doll that she does many times
 
03:11:53.229 --> 03:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
that in her work um we also sometimes
 
03:11:55.750 --> 03:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
need technical consultants and support
 
03:11:57.790 --> 03:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
um we need often to have space for
 
03:11:59.910 --> 03:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
public meetings can which can involve
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
cost um there's River monitoring
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
equipment for committees that that
 
03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
involve themselves directly in that
 
03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
process um there's often data collection
 
03:12:11.950 --> 03:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
and Analysis cost um there's
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
considerable development of educational
 
03:12:17.550 --> 03:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
materials and websites uh there's a lot
 
03:12:19.790 --> 03:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
of community engagement so events
 
03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the river and informing people
 
03:12:24.630 --> 03:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
and connecting people with the rivers um
 
03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
and also you know upkeeping maps and
 
03:12:28.950 --> 03:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
signage so that people are aware of you
 
03:12:30.429 --> 03:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
know where the rivers are and how to
 
03:12:32.590 --> 03:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
access them that's a that's a short list
 
03:12:35.710 --> 03:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
of what might be covered by um these
 
03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:37.550 align:start position:0%
of what might be covered by um these
funds

03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:12:40.469 --> 03:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll I'll say you might see in
 
03:12:43.790 --> 03:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
the B the bill that it's requesting
 
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
$40,000 each year and then it puts a cap
 
03:12:49.950 --> 03:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
of10 ,000 per award I want to make it
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
clear the likely goal or the intended
 
03:12:54.870 --> 03:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
goal is not to fund four organizations
 
03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
at that level um we wanted to allow
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
projects up to uh $10,000 which puts it
 
03:13:05.150 --> 03:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
below governor and Council threshold um
 
03:13:07.710 --> 03:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
but uh the expectation is many of the
 
03:13:10.590 --> 03:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
Committees would request far less and so
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
the funds would would go to many more uh
 
03:13:16.910 --> 03:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
lac's across across the state um I
 
03:13:18.550 --> 03:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
understand and it's a tight budget year
 
03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
um so I know this is the policy uh
 
03:13:24.429 --> 03:13:24.439 align:start position:0%
review of of the um proposal it will
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
then go on to to to uh financial review
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
um I do want to point out uh as you'll
 
03:13:32.790 --> 03:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
see it's only authorized for the for two
 
03:13:36.190 --> 03:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
years um during that time we hope to see
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
how uh These funds are utilized by the
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
lacc's and um you know if those uh
 
03:13:45.510 --> 03:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
resources look to be beneficial we we
 
03:13:47.469 --> 03:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
would hope to it would continue but
 
03:13:49.030 --> 03:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's not in the in the current
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
proposal um with that I'll end my
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and take any questions anyone
 
03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
have any questions for the
 
03:13:59.309 --> 03:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
representative representative NAB thank
 
03:14:00.590 --> 03:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for being here
 
03:14:02.229 --> 03:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
and taking my question um I don't know
 
03:14:04.349 --> 03:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
if you saw but Dees expressed concerns
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
about the rul making piece of this um
 
03:14:08.469 --> 03:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
for such a small amount that it might be
 
03:14:10.990 --> 03:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a large amount of time to do
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
that and made a suggestion in changing
 
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
their language I don't know if you saw
 
03:14:16.309 --> 03:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
that or if you have any cons if you
 
03:14:19.950 --> 03:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
would I'm let the folks uh from Dees
 
03:14:21.870 --> 03:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
speak to that um but you don't have any
 
03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about the idea of just of
 
03:14:26.030 --> 03:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
changing that language so it doesn't
 
03:14:28.590 --> 03:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
involve Ru making and no the idea of
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
this is not to be burdensome to anyone
 
03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
so if it can be accomplished more
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
effectively that way then then that's
 
03:14:37.269 --> 03:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
certainly okay with me okay thank you
 
03:14:38.630 --> 03:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:14:43.710 --> 03:14:43.720 align:start position:0%

river is
 
03:16:41.630 --> 03:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
designated um all 19 designated rivers
 
03:16:43.830 --> 03:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
are a result of a Grassroots effort by
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
their local communities and it requires
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
both legislative and Governor approval

03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment again this is an
 
03:19:10.750 --> 03:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
administrative Amendment and the idea
 
03:19:13.110 --> 03:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
was simply to make the process of
 
03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
dispersing the funds as easy and simple
 
03:19:17.950 --> 03:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
as possible for such a small amount of
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
money um we are welcome to uh any
 
03:19:25.070 --> 03:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
suggestions on how to best accomplish
 
03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
this and if rules are the best way to do
 
03:19:29.349 --> 03:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
that we're happy to do that
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%

03:19:51.910 --> 03:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
we do not uh this program does not give
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
money to New Hampshire Lakes other
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%

03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings a great deal of intrigue so
 
03:21:05.750 --> 03:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing that one my name
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
is Michelle Trembley and I'll offer
 
03:21:10.030 --> 03:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
testimony for two organizations that I
 
03:21:11.750 --> 03:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
lead the first is the New Hampshire
 
03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
Rivers Council and you have that letter
 
03:21:16.590 --> 03:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
in front of you with the blue logo up at
 
03:21:19.269 --> 03:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
at the top I won't read it and I won't
 
03:21:22.030 --> 03:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
go over any ground covered but I do want
 
03:21:25.469 --> 03:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
to uh say that the New Hampshire Rivers
 
03:21:27.630 --> 03:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
Council has been there since the start
 
03:21:29.590 --> 03:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
for those of you who have ever wondered
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
what that poster is right there with the
 
03:21:35.309 --> 03:21:35.319 align:start position:0%
five bands of river pictures our R&amp;D is
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
near and dear to our hearts because it
 
03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
originally passed RSA 483 with those
 
03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
five rivers in the beginning and since
 
03:21:46.830 --> 03:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
then 22 rivers or river segments are in
 
03:21:49.870 --> 03:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
the program and 20 local River
 
03:21:51.950 --> 03:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
Management advisory committees are
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
active this comprises about uh over a
 
03:21:59.630 --> 03:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
th% uh Pardon Me a th000 River miles
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's about N Out of our
 
03:22:06.229 --> 03:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
19,000 miles of rivers that's about 50%
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the states municipalities or
 
03:22:11.229 --> 03:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
localities that are in the program with
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
about 200
 
03:22:15.389 --> 03:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
volunteers the value so far that they've
 
03:22:18.510 --> 03:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
donated as of the last banum report is
 
03:22:18.520 --> 03:22:19.910 align:start position:0%
donated as of the last banum report is
about

03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
$157,000 so the state does see a great
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
return on its investment and this very
 
03:22:28.710 --> 03:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
modest grant program will add very
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
little to the budget hardly noticeable
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
as far as Appropriations are concerned
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
but it will return a great deal and in
 
03:22:40.670 --> 03:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
addition to sponsors kraton and
 
03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
representatives turo I am also part of
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
an Lac I've been chair for almost all of
 
03:22:50.070 --> 03:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
of its Charter 35 years so more than
 
03:22:53.229 --> 03:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
half of my life has been spent on one
 
03:22:55.309 --> 03:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
and everyone who has served on them I
 
03:22:57.790 --> 03:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
believe feels very strongly that this is
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
a great service to municipalities they
 
03:23:02.510 --> 03:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
are nominated by select boards City
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
council's Boards of Alderman and then
 
03:23:07.269 --> 03:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
they're appointed by the rivers
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
management advisory committee so this is
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
a groundup effort and it's really
 
03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
important to note that they work closely
 
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
representing their municipalities in
 
03:23:19.950 --> 03:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
particular the management plans which is
 
03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
one of the two statutory duties this is
 
03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
more or less an unfunded mandate because
 
03:23:28.750 --> 03:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
the river advisory committees do not
 
03:23:30.790 --> 03:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
have a dedicated funding source so I
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
want to thank Representatives Crayton
 
03:23:35.630 --> 03:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
and tur for bringing this bill forward
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
and I um that will conclude that
 
03:23:40.950 --> 03:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
testimony until you ask me to speak for
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
the rivers management advisory
 
03:23:47.389 --> 03:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
committee so on her one hat anybody have
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
a question for
 
03:23:51.229 --> 03:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
her I don't see any but why don't you
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
just stay there and tell us about your
 
03:23:55.429 --> 03:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
second hat I appreciate second and by
 
03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
the way I'm not sick I'm in an immune
 
03:23:59.469 --> 03:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
compromis household but this is what I
 
03:24:03.150 --> 03:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
look like when I'm working in my office
 
03:24:05.550 --> 03:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
all right on to the next volunteer
 
03:24:07.469 --> 03:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
activity and that is the rivers
 
03:24:09.710 --> 03:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
management advisory committee which I
 
03:24:12.670 --> 03:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
chair again will not read the letter but
 
03:24:15.550 --> 03:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to accentuate that this program
 
03:24:18.309 --> 03:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
has these multiple levels the state
 
03:24:21.150 --> 03:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
level and the local level and the
 
03:24:23.550 --> 03:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
rmac rivers management advisory
 
03:24:25.950 --> 03:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
committee feels very strongly that the
 
03:24:28.790 --> 03:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are ultimately going to
 
03:24:32.189 --> 03:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
benefit from the volunteers work if they
 
03:24:34.229 --> 03:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
have a little boost with their funding
 
03:24:37.229 --> 03:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
and without funding we have the
 
03:24:40.110 --> 03:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
$157,000 in match the belief is is that
 
03:24:43.550 --> 03:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see manyfold a return if this
 
03:24:47.110 --> 03:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
modest appropriation is passed and and
 
03:24:51.469 --> 03:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
um the the statutory requirement has
 
03:24:54.150 --> 03:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
been of significant concern for some
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
time because many lac's want to fulfill
 
03:25:00.349 --> 03:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
this obligation but have not been able
 
03:25:03.309 --> 03:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
to because there really is a requirement
 
03:25:06.030 --> 03:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
to have some Technical Resources and
 
03:25:08.269 --> 03:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
some staff people available to just
 
03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
boost those volunteer efforts and get
 
03:25:12.630 --> 03:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
them over the finish line so that
 
03:25:15.870 --> 03:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities can have these plans so
 
03:25:18.429 --> 03:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
both the RAC and the New Hampshire
 
03:25:20.630 --> 03:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
Rivers Council feel strongly that this
 
03:25:24.030 --> 03:25:24.040 align:start position:0%

exact the four bills that we'll hear
 
03:30:43.429 --> 03:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
after we exec the eight bills in the
 
03:30:46.990 --> 03:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
morning and as of today that will bring
 
03:30:49.630 --> 03:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
us up to speed and date uh for our bills
 
03:30:51.269 --> 03:30:51.279 align:start position:0%

for getting their reports in that helps
 
03:31:02.950 --> 03:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
me uh I think the process that we did
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
the first 10 bills work out excellent uh
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
if we could just keep that up because
 
03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
we've got the eight and then the three
 
03:31:14.349 --> 03:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh so we got another 11 to to write U
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
but we'll have time and we'll still
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
still follow that same process if I can
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
get them by the weekend then I have the
 
03:31:22.750 --> 03:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
weekend to enjoy reading and and working
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
on them while I'm running around doing
 
03:31:44.830 --> 03:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:44.840 --> 03:32:14.830 align:start position:0%

03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
committee we met five times last year to
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the ongoing problems
 
03:34:53.429 --> 03:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
with the state's
 
03:34:55.990 --> 03:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
dams Mr chairman the state of New
 
03:34:58.990 --> 03:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire finds itself uniquely situated
 
03:35:03.429 --> 03:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:05.469 --> 03:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure there is not another
 
03:35:08.030 --> 03:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
state the union that possesses direct
 
03:35:10.349 --> 03:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
ownership over a significant amount of
 
03:35:14.070 --> 03:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
dams and impoundments as New Hampshire
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
does today the State of New Hampshire
 
03:35:20.910 --> 03:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
owns 276 dams 208 that are directly
 
03:35:22.269 --> 03:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
operated by the Department of
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and any
 
03:35:28.110 --> 03:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
impoundment exceeding 6
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
feet is considered in this
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
figure meanwhile the state of ront
 
03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
directly owns only 14
 
03:35:42.110 --> 03:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
dams of the dams not operated by
 
03:35:44.990 --> 03:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
Dees the remainder are operated among
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%

number of leases to
 
03:35:59.070 --> 03:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
hydrogenerators has declined presumably
 
03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
because of the burden of capital
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%

03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
approximate cost to rehabilitate and
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
remediate the aforementioned total would
 
03:37:10.590 --> 03:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
exceed 400
 
03:37:13.710 --> 03:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
million Dees provides the dam Bureau
 
03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
with an annual revenue of roughly $7
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
million on average evenly split among
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
the general fund Capital Appropriations
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
in addition to hydrop power revenues
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
rental proceeds and other
 
03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
fees to abide by a 50-year
 
03:37:32.349 --> 03:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation schedule the dam Bureau
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
requires $16 million annually current
 
03:37:39.630 --> 03:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
reeven revenues receive place a dam
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau short by over $16 million
 
03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:47.349 align:start position:0%
Bureau short by over $16 million
annually

03:37:47.349 --> 03:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
annually
 
03:37:49.349 --> 03:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
and this is only to repair the dams in a
 
03:37:51.309 --> 03:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
50-year period if we go with it
 
03:37:53.830 --> 03:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
shortfall it would take over 100 years
 
03:37:55.830 --> 03:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
to meet our
 
03:37:58.349 --> 03:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
obligations considering the age and
 
03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
condition and growth and development
 
03:38:02.670 --> 03:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
Downstream from State dams it is an
 
03:38:02.680 --> 03:38:04.469 align:start position:0%
Downstream from State dams it is an
untenable

03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
untenable
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
situation the state began assuming
 
03:38:10.150 --> 03:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
ownership of dams in the 1940s 50s and
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
60s many of these new newly acquired
 
03:38:18.349 --> 03:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
assets were from the 19th and 20th
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
Century they're Antiquated and have
 
03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
significantly aging
 
03:38:26.469 --> 03:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
Parts while the state of New Hampshire
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
is an exception in respect to the
 
03:38:31.389 --> 03:38:31.399 align:start position:0%
ownership of its dams it may not be an
 
03:38:33.550 --> 03:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
exception regarding the growth of the
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
national Trend in Dam
 
03:38:39.229 --> 03:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
failures failures have occurred in Texas
 
03:38:42.389 --> 03:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
Michigan Minnesota Vermont and even in
 
03:38:44.710 --> 03:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire itself and I do have a
 
03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
handout Mr the chairman that actually
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
identifies those dams that have failed
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
in the uh State recently you may recall
 
03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
Dam failures in Littleton Forest Lake
 
03:38:57.510 --> 03:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
Newport and the town of Warren have all
 
03:38:59.710 --> 03:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
experienced a failure of significant
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
damage in recent history New Hampshire
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
Dees asserts that weather and climate
 
03:39:08.429 --> 03:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
may not be the primary instigator of
 
03:39:08.439 --> 03:39:09.990 align:start position:0%
may not be the primary instigator of
these

03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:39:12.630 --> 03:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
failures in addition to Rehabilitation
 
03:39:15.790 --> 03:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
the committee also considered removal of
 
03:39:15.800 --> 03:39:16.670 align:start position:0%
the committee also considered removal of
State

03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
State
 
03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
dams regardless of the
 
03:39:23.790 --> 03:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
removal uh failure of these dams would
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
actually bring water levels anywhere
 
03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
between 5 and 10 ft or entirely below
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:34.870 --> 03:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
itself in light of the Nationwide
 
03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
incidences and in light of current
 
03:39:39.070 --> 03:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
storms and the imminent Revenue
 
03:39:41.510 --> 03:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
challenges the committee found it
 
03:39:44.790 --> 03:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
prudent that a stable consistent
 
03:39:47.070 --> 03:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism to furnish the Department of
 
03:39:49.750 --> 03:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services with sufficient
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
funds for the operation maintenance and
 
03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
established the current Arrangement is
 
03:39:59.359 --> 03:40:00.349 align:start position:0%
established the current Arrangement is
not

03:40:00.349 --> 03:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:40:02.349 --> 03:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
sustainable nor is it in the best
 
03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
interest of local communities
 
03:40:07.469 --> 03:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
recreational environmental interests or
 
03:40:10.030 --> 03:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
future budgets and with that Mr chairman
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions and
 
03:40:15.189 --> 03:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
with your approval I do have a handout
 
03:40:18.030 --> 03:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
with which has a lot of information
 
03:40:20.189 --> 03:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure you'll find interesting
 
03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you before you hand that out does
 
03:40:26.670 --> 03:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative representative Sergeant
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr representative how
 
03:40:34.830 --> 03:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
did you uh or what's the policy behind
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
limiting the tax increase to Waterfront
 
03:40:40.469 --> 03:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
owners well we looked at a number of
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
options uh one was to fund it through
 
03:40:44.550 --> 03:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
General funds there was General
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
consensus wasn't fear to would tax
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state for something
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
they may not utilize we looked at the
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer taxes another
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
possibility but again people would be
 
03:40:57.150 --> 03:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
paying that assessment when they would
 
03:40:59.630 --> 03:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
have no benefit of the DM so we looked
 
03:41:01.189 --> 03:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
at it at the end when we were done and
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
we held five public hearings on this
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
that if someone's directly impacted they
 
03:41:08.030 --> 03:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
probably should pay the fee and not
 
03:41:10.349 --> 03:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
someone that wasn't directly impacted so
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's where the fee structure idea came
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
from representative NAB thank you Mr
 
03:41:16.830 --> 03:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
was there any consideration of um
 
03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
treating shorel that's not in current
 
03:41:22.469 --> 03:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
use or that's in conservation
 
03:41:24.189 --> 03:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
differently than that they they would be
 
03:41:26.269 --> 03:41:26.279 align:start position:0%
exempt so it would be like commercial
 
03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
residential but any conservation land
 
03:41:30.990 --> 03:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from the tax or fee it's
 
03:41:34.110 --> 03:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
a fee not a tax okay sorry Fe um and UND
 
03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
undeveloped land would be the same uh if
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
it was incurrent use yes but if it was
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
just sitting there would still be
 
03:41:44.229 --> 03:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
subject to thank you anyone
 
03:41:47.550 --> 03:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
else representative Derby thank you Mr
 
03:41:49.189 --> 03:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
03:41:52.750 --> 03:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
question um the for some of these dams
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
as I understand are um impounding
 
03:41:59.630 --> 03:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
property in impounding water bodies that
 
03:42:03.070 --> 03:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
do not have Public Access so should um
 
03:42:06.110 --> 03:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
the all this uh should this load be
 
03:42:09.750 --> 03:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
spread to all public to all Waterfront
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh property owners in those cases when
 
03:42:15.309 --> 03:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh those water bodies have a very small
 
03:42:18.269 --> 03:42:18.279 align:start position:0%
um uh number of people that can access
 
03:42:18.279 --> 03:42:18.950 align:start position:0%
um uh number of people that can access
the

03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:21.389 --> 03:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
water it would be based on any
 
03:42:23.349 --> 03:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
waterfront property that was actually
 
03:42:25.830 --> 03:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
created by an impoundment and some of
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
the information I have here in front of
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
me just to give you an idea I think most
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
of you are probably familiar with
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
Newfound Lake uh in Bristol that's a uh
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
High Hazard Dam there it's in poor
 
03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
condition and the height the water
 
03:42:44.790 --> 03:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
height is 12 feet so if that DM had to
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
be breached or in other words they not
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
might necessarily not have to be
 
03:42:50.269 --> 03:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
breached but the gates would be open the
 
03:42:51.870 --> 03:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
drain the lake so you could see there'd
 
03:42:54.990 --> 03:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
be a significant loss of lakefront if
 
03:42:56.790 --> 03:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
that Dam had to be breached if it you
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
know you couldn't afford to repair it
 
03:43:00.510 --> 03:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
and there are other major dams across
 
03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
the state uh that come to mind uh Lake
 
03:43:07.950 --> 03:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
wiip uh that impounds 10 fet of
 
03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
water and that dam is also in poor
 
03:43:12.830 --> 03:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
condition fair to poor condition and
 
03:43:15.149 --> 03:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
there's some others that are significant
 
03:43:18.389 --> 03:43:18.399 align:start position:0%
trouble and uh for instance Lake Sunapee
 
03:43:21.389 --> 03:43:21.399 align:start position:0%
and that's 14 feet of elevation that the
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
dam provides so this is a serious
 
03:43:25.389 --> 03:43:25.399 align:start position:0%
problem and as you can see we've got
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dams in the state and
 
03:43:30.349 --> 03:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
without adequate fees to take care of
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
those dams at some point there will be a
 
03:43:36.149 --> 03:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
major breach and uh property and lives
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
lost yes representative
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
for taking the question for commercial
 
03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
use of the dam such as the power
 
03:43:52.030 --> 03:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
companies how are the fees set with them
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
they and the dees is behind me they're
 
03:43:55.389 --> 03:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
probably more familiar with the fee
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
structure but they all are assessed a
 
03:44:00.070 --> 03:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
fee if it's a state Dam so they do pay
 
03:44:01.990 --> 03:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
the state for the use and production of
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
power at that facility I don't know what
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
the fees are what they're based on but
 
03:44:07.229 --> 03:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
they are assessed a fee if it's a
 
03:44:07.239 --> 03:44:08.469 align:start position:0%
they are assessed a fee if it's a
state-owned

03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
state-owned
 
03:44:08.479 --> 03:44:10.750 align:start position:0%
state-owned
dam

03:44:10.750 --> 03:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
dam
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
sure any other
 
03:44:15.429 --> 03:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no hands thank you for
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
your testimony yeah thanks for your
 
03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
courtesy and if it's all right I pass
 
03:44:21.870 --> 03:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
those out now while you're passing those
 
03:44:25.389 --> 03:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
out Corey Clark from New Hampshire dees
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
are you speaking
 
03:44:34.349 --> 03:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:47.910 --> 03:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:49.990 --> 03:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
I could Mr CH I put in a card for both
 
03:44:52.149 --> 03:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
of us so I didn't know if you were going
 
03:44:54.429 --> 03:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
to just watch and see how we did
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
so actually it's quite the other way
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
around I
 
03:45:00.510 --> 03:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
think so for the record I'm Bob Scott
 
03:45:01.750 --> 03:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm commissioner with the Department of
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and Corey and for
 
03:45:06.269 --> 03:45:06.279 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Corey Clark chief
 
03:45:07.630 --> 03:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
engineer at the dam Bureau at the New
 
03:45:08.830 --> 03:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
Services thank you welcome to resources
 
03:45:14.110 --> 03:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so the handout we have is that
 
03:45:16.590 --> 03:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
already gone okay so we have a handout
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's going around uh I don't want to
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
re reiterate too much of what the the
 
03:45:23.950 --> 03:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
the uh representative leechman said but
 
03:45:27.389 --> 03:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
I do want to make some some points uh so
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
again uh Corey is is our drio chief uh
 
03:45:35.349 --> 03:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
with a lot of experience uh he replaced
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
a longtime state employee uh you know
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
similarly uh as with any change we we we
 
03:45:43.189 --> 03:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
we tend to relook at things when
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
somebody new comes in one of the
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
concerns big largest concerns we had as
 
03:45:50.590 --> 03:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
articulated is again we we are
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintenance and
 
03:45:56.349 --> 03:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation of the 276 State dams uh
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
and 64 of those are high Hazard again so
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
what that means is uh there's potential
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
loss of Li and property if if the dam uh
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
were at risk um
 
03:46:09.630 --> 03:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
so going back in time if we look
 
03:46:13.149 --> 03:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
historically we are generally funded out
 
03:46:14.910 --> 03:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
of the capital budget for the repair
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
shes to state owned dams uh going back
 
03:46:21.550 --> 03:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
in that same time frame the past decades
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
the this is not a knock on the the the
 
03:46:26.910 --> 03:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
general court but the the level of
 
03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
funding we've been receiving puts us on
 
03:46:31.630 --> 03:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
a 100-year cycle to
 
03:46:35.550 --> 03:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate the the 276 dams and that's
 
03:46:38.189 --> 03:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
that's very was very concerning for me
 
03:46:40.590 --> 03:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
because of that we asked Last by anym we
 
03:46:42.990 --> 03:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
asked for the study commission which the
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor was was discussing
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh to look for ways for a sustainable
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
funding source for the dams
 
03:46:56.149 --> 03:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
so a couple more points uh is so the
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
high Hazard dams you and I I'll be very
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
blunt here again that's that involves a
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
potential loss of life for property uh
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
the agency certainly not under my watch
 
03:47:08.149 --> 03:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
you we will not knowingly allow that
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
type of thing to happen so what that
 
03:47:12.349 --> 03:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
means as articulated by the sponsor is
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
if a dam is in a condition where it it
 
03:47:16.990 --> 03:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
that possible we will be forced to
 
03:47:19.189 --> 03:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
unilaterally lower the level of that Dam
 
03:47:22.030 --> 03:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
to make it safe and again as an example
 
03:47:23.950 --> 03:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
the Lakeport Dam on Lake onab basaki we
 
03:47:26.189 --> 03:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
would be lowering it 10 feet as an
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
example uh and there's many examples
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so that's just a
 
03:47:34.110 --> 03:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
reality so this is not a case
 
03:47:37.070 --> 03:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
where if if things aren't funded it's
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay this the dam deteriorates whether
 
03:47:40.870 --> 03:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
you fund it or not for for the you know
 
03:47:43.750 --> 03:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'm stating the obvious I know so Our
 
03:47:45.630 --> 03:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
intention was with that study committee
 
03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
was again to raise awareness I I I truly
 
03:47:51.389 --> 03:47:51.399 align:start position:0%
believe the average citizen doesn't
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
really think about the dam that's
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
holding up the the empowerment uh I'm
 
03:47:57.670 --> 03:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
here to tell you there's unless you're
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
using a canoe or a kayak I guarantee you
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
that water body you're putting your boat
 
03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
in for example is supported by a dam
 
03:48:09.149 --> 03:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
that's just the reality in this state um
 
03:48:11.710 --> 03:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
so that's that's really our goal is to
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
educate and ultimately find a
 
03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
sustainable way to fun fund these dams I
 
03:48:18.510 --> 03:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
I want to thank again representative dun
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
and and you know the members of the the
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh that looked at this uh
 
03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
we we uh I do have again uh our chief
 
03:48:30.790 --> 03:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
engineer here we want to make ourselves
 
03:48:33.389 --> 03:48:33.399 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions again
 
03:48:35.710 --> 03:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
it's imperative my view that we find a
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding source I will say
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
the actual mechanism of how the funding
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
happens we're agnostic at this point we
 
03:48:45.550 --> 03:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that ultimately
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
we get to a point where we can find a
 
03:48:49.630 --> 03:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
sustainable way to fund these dams and
 
03:48:52.349 --> 03:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
make sure again uh New Hampshire's
 
03:48:54.910 --> 03:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
economy and and and uh people are are
 
03:48:56.510 --> 03:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
safe and
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner did you want to speak or
 
03:49:01.840 --> 03:49:02.550 align:start position:0%
commissioner did you want to speak or
you

03:49:02.550 --> 03:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:49:04.950 --> 03:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
allet I can speak just real quickly just
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
kind of bit on the background of the um
 
03:49:08.830 --> 03:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
Dam maintenance fund question came up
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
about the hydros how how has that worked
 
03:49:14.429 --> 03:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
so really um as the sponsor had said
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
begin beginning around 1937 that's when
 
03:49:18.189 --> 03:49:18.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire started
 
03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
taking on ownership of some of these
 
03:49:22.189 --> 03:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
dams and really kind of peaked in the uh
 
03:49:25.229 --> 03:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
60s and early 70s in which the state
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
years on years on end were taking over
 
03:49:29.229 --> 03:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
these dams that originally built in the
 
03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
1800s by power companies or uh mill
 
03:49:34.269 --> 03:49:34.279 align:start position:0%
companies and the state was taking over
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
these assets because they were no longer
 
03:49:38.229 --> 03:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh useful to those companies or the
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
companies could no longer sustain the
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the repair costs so the
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
state was taking that on in the 1980s
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
the dam maintenance fund was created as
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
a funding mechanism to support uh the
 
03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
repair and reconstruction and the
 
03:49:53.670 --> 03:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
operation of state-owned dams the the
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
idea behind that is the state of New
 
03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would lease uh various sites
 
03:50:00.710 --> 03:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
to hydropower producers and as part of
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue they would actually um
 
03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
receive that as income that would help
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
support the program um what happened was
 
03:50:11.790 --> 03:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
is throughout the 1990s the program was
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
pretty much self-funding uh and then
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
when the
 
03:50:17.790 --> 03:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
power power purchase agreements were all
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
restructured as part of the divestment
 
03:50:21.870 --> 03:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
that occurred in the
 
03:50:24.189 --> 03:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
2002 those power purchase agreements
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
dropped from anywhere from around 15 or
 
03:50:28.750 --> 03:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
17 cents a kilowatt hour that the Hydro
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
power producer was getting down to
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
around 3 cents a kilowatt hour and it's
 
03:50:34.830 --> 03:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
been like that ever since so since the
 
03:50:38.149 --> 03:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
early 2000s the uh Revenue coming into
 
03:50:40.110 --> 03:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
the dam IND this fund has dropped
 
03:50:42.429 --> 03:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
significantly and also the number of
 
03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
hydro sites has also dropped in 2004 we
 
03:50:47.950 --> 03:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
had 12 sites that were we were leasing
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
for Hydro power that number is now down
 
03:50:52.269 --> 03:50:52.279 align:start position:0%
to eight so the most recent site that we
 
03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
just lost that used to create Hydro
 
03:50:56.149 --> 03:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
power was that Kelly's Falls Dam in
 
03:50:57.550 --> 03:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester some of you may have been
 
03:51:00.269 --> 03:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with some of the um articles
 
03:51:01.990 --> 03:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
written on that but essentially that
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
site was a site in which the hydrop
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
power producer um was there they were
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
relicensing that project through the FK
 
03:51:11.469 --> 03:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
which oversees all hydrop power as part
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the relicensing they were required to
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
put in fish passage it became
 
03:51:18.750 --> 03:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
um economically uh unfeasible in order
 
03:51:20.349 --> 03:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
to actually do that and still make
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue at that site so they they
 
03:51:24.149 --> 03:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
relinquish their lease at that site left
 
03:51:26.110 --> 03:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
the site and now the dees is now
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
operating that site without hydr power
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
so we have a Hydro power unit that's
 
03:51:31.990 --> 03:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
sitting their idle trying to figure out
 
03:51:34.030 --> 03:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
what we can do to get that site running
 
03:51:35.550 --> 03:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
so that's just a bit of the background
 
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
of where we're at roughly we get around
 
03:51:40.510 --> 03:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
$600,000 in revenue from all of our
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
leases um you know we we discussed uh
 
03:51:46.189 --> 03:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
lak Port Dam y ois hocki that's a very
 
03:51:48.550 --> 03:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
small hydropower site that site we get
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
just around a little over $7,000 in
 
03:51:54.189 --> 03:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
lease revenue from that site annually so
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
it certainly helps every little bit does
 
03:51:59.229 --> 03:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to help on the repair
 
03:52:01.149 --> 03:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
of the 70-year-old Gates that we have
 
03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
out there that uh really need to be
 
03:52:06.070 --> 03:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
fixed in order to maintain lisaki so
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
with that we'll open up with any
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
question and the average age of uh state
 
03:52:12.349 --> 03:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
owned dams are anywhere from 100 to 200
 
03:52:14.670 --> 03:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
years old I mean we just did a uh
 
03:52:16.830 --> 03:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
failure analysis at B Lake Dam over in
 
03:52:19.870 --> 03:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
statford which is 192 years old and so
 
03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for us to be dealing
 
03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
with structures that were built in the
 
03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
1800s that are really still in the same
 
03:52:27.389 --> 03:52:27.399 align:start position:0%
configuration as they were in the
 
03:52:30.030 --> 03:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
1800s thank you Mr
 
03:52:33.550 --> 03:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
Clark question representative Dunn thank
 
03:52:35.309 --> 03:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you guys for being
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
here today really appreciate it one of
 
03:52:39.070 --> 03:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
the things that the committee came up
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
with was to have you guys help us
 
03:52:44.590 --> 03:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
educate the body and I feel like
 
03:52:47.469 --> 03:52:47.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere that that got lost so we're
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
executing this bill next week and I
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
would say the majority of this committee
 
03:52:52.630 --> 03:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't even know how important most
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
these dams are and how much impact they
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
have on the local economy so um I don't
 
03:53:01.070 --> 03:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
know if it's too late or not but if you
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
guys one of the things that we had
 
03:53:04.030 --> 03:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
talked about was you guys educating this
 
03:53:06.070 --> 03:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
body and the finance committee as to how
 
03:53:08.229 --> 03:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
important this is because this bill is
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
needed but in this environment of
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
economic if we don't educate the people
 
03:53:15.309 --> 03:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
they're not going to vote for this so um
 
03:53:17.149 --> 03:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
you know and you guys have any plans to
 
03:53:19.870 --> 03:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
educate the body to help them understand
 
03:53:20.910 --> 03:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
the importance of this and how it
 
03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
affects their local
 
03:53:24.550 --> 03:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
economy so I I've certainly been
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
presenting anytime I've been invited in
 
03:53:29.710 --> 03:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
um science technology and energy um I
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
did a presentation to that that B that
 
03:53:34.590 --> 03:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
committee on on this very issue and
 
03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
there's also been several other
 
03:53:38.590 --> 03:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
different not legislative organizations
 
03:53:40.189 --> 03:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
but outside organizations that we've
 
03:53:41.710 --> 03:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
been really trying to push this message
 
03:53:41.720 --> 03:53:45.670 align:start position:0%
been really trying to push this message
through

03:53:45.670 --> 03:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.910 --> 03:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
again similar similarly we're we're uh
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
we'll make ourselves available to any
 
03:53:52.830 --> 03:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
and all uh one thing I think we talked
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
about in committee is Maybe if but I
 
03:53:57.630 --> 03:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
think we would need a sponsor to do that
 
03:53:58.990 --> 03:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
if you want to have a general session
 
03:54:01.149 --> 03:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
available someday at repa we' be happy
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
to do that too uh so any and all of
 
03:54:09.870 --> 03:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah follow follow up um the timing
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
might not be good for that but um I
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
think education will help the body
 
03:54:17.550 --> 03:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
understand how important this is because
 
03:54:18.910 --> 03:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
I would be willing to bet you that the
 
03:54:20.429 --> 03:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
majority of the Reps here don't even
 
03:54:24.149 --> 03:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
know the lakes that have dams and how
 
03:54:26.309 --> 03:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
important it is to the local economy so
 
03:54:27.990 --> 03:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
um you know education is always a good
 
03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing and if we could get together and
 
03:54:31.750 --> 03:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
do that I'd be happy to to do that but I
 
03:54:32.910 --> 03:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
know we have a short time frame before
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
this is exact so but thank you guys for
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
coming presentation you mentioned you
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
make is it on PowerPoint
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
slides less than 100 slides yes okay
 
03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to send your PowerPoint
 
03:54:49.550 --> 03:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
presentation to the committee not that
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to everybody's going
 
03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
to watch it but at least then you'll
 
03:54:56.189 --> 03:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
have that you can click through it um
 
03:54:57.870 --> 03:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
then you can contact these gentlemen if
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
you have any specific questions before
 
03:55:00.120 --> 03:55:01.590 align:start position:0%
you have any specific questions before
next

03:55:01.590 --> 03:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:55:04.510 --> 03:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
week representative
 
03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
ghoul you need to put your mic down and
 
03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
turn it
 
03:55:10.910 --> 03:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
on yes I don't have a question but maybe
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
have a good editorial in some of the
 
03:55:15.269 --> 03:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
newspapers so that everybody knows about
 
03:55:18.510 --> 03:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
it maybe can you know do
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
something good idea any other questions
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
for the Reps we'll go to Mr Taylor then
 
03:55:26.349 --> 03:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr
 
03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for the question I
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
have many leaks in my district and one
 
03:55:35.309 --> 03:55:35.319 align:start position:0%
of them has a dam Authority which pays
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh to state so much a year slake oopy
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
two of the three towns that B on the
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
lake would that Dam Authority and the
 
03:55:48.510 --> 03:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:51.149 --> 03:55:51.159 align:start position:0%
this so that that that is a unique
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
situation that we have over there on
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
Lake oy with the the authority over
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
there um that the the re the the income
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
that we get from that Authority my
 
03:56:02.149 --> 03:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that really just
 
03:56:04.590 --> 03:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
helps provide some of the on-site
 
03:56:06.590 --> 03:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
operation that we have to do out there
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately what we're seeing at
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
Lake oopy while we did invest over $6
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
million on one part of the two dams that
 
03:56:16.830 --> 03:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
are required out there the other Dam out
 
03:56:18.550 --> 03:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
there needs significant Rehabilitation
 
03:56:20.710 --> 03:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
work as well so we're going to be
 
03:56:23.149 --> 03:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
looking at somehow funding probably
 
03:56:25.469 --> 03:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
upwards of four to5 million in
 
03:56:27.670 --> 03:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
renovations that that other side of the
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
dam is also going to require sometime in
 
03:56:32.070 --> 03:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
the near future is capital budget yes
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
and and the uh the one that we repaired
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
several years ago the 6.5 million that
 
03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
was all capital Appropriations that took
 
03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
place for that none of the um none of
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
the um um
 
03:56:46.510 --> 03:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
not not the association but what you had
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously The Authority thank
 
03:56:52.349 --> 03:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:56:56.110 --> 03:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for being
 
03:56:59.070 --> 03:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
available today um I have a question on
 
03:57:02.149 --> 03:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh the taxability of the land um the way
 
03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
I read the this bill it says all taxable
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
waterfronts we heard um uh the prime
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor say that um current use wouldn't
 
03:57:14.349 --> 03:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
be uh included but current use is taxed
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
land so it seems to me that this um
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
assessment would be um made by
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
how do you interpret that s that this
 
03:57:27.790 --> 03:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
bill so on on that front um I know there
 
03:57:29.550 --> 03:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
are certain questions coming up about
 
03:57:30.750 --> 03:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
what's you know what's taxable what's
 
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
not taxable conservation land current
 
03:57:35.429 --> 03:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
land use things of that nature uh one
 
03:57:36.870 --> 03:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
thing that we do believe that would help
 
03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
us um as part of this is having
 
03:57:41.590 --> 03:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority we do think we have
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
that Authority Under 42 uh col 87 as far
 
03:57:47.309 --> 03:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
as being able to make rules within the
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
chapter of 42 which the fee would be
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
included however certainly including the
 
03:57:53.349 --> 03:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority within the bill
 
03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
would help bolster that and allow us to
 
03:57:57.990 --> 03:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
have a process not only of what land
 
03:57:59.870 --> 03:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
would be taxable but how about how
 
03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
exactly we go about determining the
 
03:58:04.590 --> 03:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
actual linear footage on each parcel and
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature
 
03:58:09.910 --> 03:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
so follow up thank you again Mr chair
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer um so the $158
 
03:58:18.189 --> 03:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
per square per foot um can you talk talk
 
03:58:21.189 --> 03:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
about how that was computed and if it
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
would if it included the land that is
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:27.520 --> 03:58:29.309 align:start position:0%
 
use

03:58:29.309 --> 03:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
so the way that was computed is um
 
03:58:34.349 --> 03:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
similar legislation came about in in
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
2009 under HB 490 at that time and that
 
03:58:42.030 --> 03:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
legislation they looked at what exactly
 
03:58:43.630 --> 03:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
would the linear footage be and it was
 
03:58:46.030 --> 03:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
roughly over 6 million linear feet of
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
shorefront is on the 276 bodies of water
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
created by state owned dams and of that
 
03:58:57.070 --> 03:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh a little over a I think 1.4 million
 
03:59:02.309 --> 03:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
is um is roughly uh what they felt was a
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
tax exempt and at that time it was non
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofits so for example the um uh
 
03:59:11.070 --> 03:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
Grafton pond in in Grafton New Hampshire
 
03:59:12.510 --> 03:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
owned by the state the dam is owned by
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that
 
03:59:17.349 --> 03:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
majority of the shorefront around that
 
03:59:19.790 --> 03:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
is um owned by a nonprofit that was not
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
included in the in the in the value and
 
03:59:25.830 --> 03:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
so the actual in 2009 when we looked at
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
this the actual value of uh taxable
 
03:59:31.149 --> 03:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
shorefront was about
 
03:59:34.750 --> 03:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
4,790 uh, linear feet would be actually
 
03:59:36.950 --> 03:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
taxable so if you take that value you
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
multiply by the dollar 58 C cents you
 
03:59:41.950 --> 03:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
come up with uh roughly a little over
 
03:59:45.389 --> 03:59:45.399 align:start position:0%
$7.5 million of Revenue potential that
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
would come out
 
03:59:49.510 --> 03:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
obviously once the program is built we
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
would go ahead reanalyze all this so
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers would likely fluctuate to
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
some degree but that's that's a ballpark
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
and that is what the committee used um
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
to make their
 
04:00:02.750 --> 04:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
assessment representative
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
Donnelly thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:00:08.189 --> 04:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I know in Sal
 
04:00:10.149 --> 04:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
we have the milville dam that's actively
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
actively being rebuilt right now and the
 
04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers had to we a grant from
 
04:00:16.830 --> 04:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
Dees and then the taxpayers also had to
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
fund a bond how many of these types of
 
04:00:22.590 --> 04:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
dams do you see long term do you say a
 
04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
bond being created where then you can
 
04:00:26.590 --> 04:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
use some of this money and it pays off
 
04:00:30.590 --> 04:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
bonds how does how does this work for de
 
04:00:32.670 --> 04:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
with your
 
04:00:35.910 --> 04:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
dams so historically going back um to
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
when the dam in fund was originally
 
04:00:40.349 --> 04:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
created there were um bonds associated
 
04:00:42.550 --> 04:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
with that um I believe those have since
 
04:00:45.550 --> 04:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
been paid off in in entirety uh so
 
04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
really as of over the past 20 years ever
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
since we started having returning
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh drops in return in revenue on the dam
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund and we've been
 
04:01:00.030 --> 04:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
switching to Capital funds really as of
 
04:01:02.229 --> 04:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
right now we solely rely on Capital
 
04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
funds for all our major repair projects
 
04:01:07.510 --> 04:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question could there
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
be some kind of bonding that that could
 
04:01:12.349 --> 04:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
take place quite possibly but I'm I'm
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
just not familiar enough with the state
 
04:01:18.750 --> 04:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.070 --> 04:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
front any other questions for our
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
speakers representative Sergeant thank
 
04:01:26.349 --> 04:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman do you know how many
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
households or or properties are
 
04:01:31.389 --> 04:01:31.399 align:start position:0%
Downstream of these dams that benefit
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
safety-wise from their
 
04:01:38.309 --> 04:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
upkeep so there Downstream of uh State
 
04:01:40.750 --> 04:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
own own dams is there's likely thousands
 
04:01:43.149 --> 04:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
of properties that would be affected if
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
if state owned dams failed um thousands
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
of Road Crossings as well however of
 
04:01:51.630 --> 04:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
that inventory of 276 stams there's only
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
27 that are actually flood control
 
04:01:56.950 --> 04:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
structures so the vast majority of these
 
04:02:00.149 --> 04:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
roughly 90% of all of these dams are not
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
made for flood retention purposes and so
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
really what that means is that that
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
Dam there would likely be less of a risk
 
04:02:11.550 --> 04:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
to those Downstream individuals if that
 
04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
Dam wasn't in place because that dam is
 
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
there the water body is created the
 
04:02:19.030 --> 04:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
threat is created if that dam was
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
removed those Downstream people would
 
04:02:23.710 --> 04:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
not have that Upstream threat so like I
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
said there are roughly 27 flood control
 
04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
sites that act truly as flood control
 
04:02:31.469 --> 04:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
sites the Imp the dams are very large in
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
relation to their actual empowerment um
 
04:02:36.550 --> 04:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
and those dams they fill up during a
 
04:02:40.030 --> 04:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
storm event similar to um as many of you
 
04:02:41.229 --> 04:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
are probably familiar with Franklin
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
Falls Dam owned by the US Army Corps of
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
Engineers hopkington Everett Dam Army
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
Corp of Engineers they they act in a
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
similar function we have about 12
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
roughly a dozen up in the baker River
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
Valley another dozen down in the sou
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
heagan River Valley and a couple other
 
04:02:57.389 --> 04:02:57.399 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout but like I said the
 
04:03:00.030 --> 04:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
vast majority of all of our dams are not
 
04:03:02.070 --> 04:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
made to work in that
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
function and if I could the uh the
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
number below the dams continues to
 
04:03:09.790 --> 04:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
increase as population fills in and that
 
04:03:12.269 --> 04:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
type of thing so we we that also results
 
04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
in the number of high Hazard Dam
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
actually increasing even though the dam
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
itself didn't change but the people
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
behind it
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
changed yeah and just just on that front
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
like in in 2004 we had um 30 33 High
 
04:03:28.990 --> 04:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams now we have 64 it's not
 
04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
because we're building new dams it's
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
because more development is occurring
 
04:03:34.030 --> 04:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
Downstream so you have dams that were
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
once a lwh hazard Dam designed and built
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
to serve that purpose houses are built
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
Downstream the classification of that
 
04:03:44.149 --> 04:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
Dam then changes now that Dam has to be
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
rebuilt to meet High Hazard criteria
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
which is which is a much higher
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
threshold for ability to manage a storm
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
event the ability to manage its
 
04:03:56.590 --> 04:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
stability things of that
 
04:04:00.149 --> 04:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
nature any other
 
04:04:02.910 --> 04:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions one followup thank you Mr
 
04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm just trying to draw the
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
distinction between why the fee the
 
04:04:10.149 --> 04:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
Shoreland uh Waterfront fee is is
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
limited to people on the water so I hear
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
it for the 250 dams that are simply
 
04:04:17.389 --> 04:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
there to create the body of water and
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
not for flood control but what about for
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
the 27 dams that do create flood control
 
04:04:24.830 --> 04:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
and benefit the downstream properties
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
why were those Property Owners do do
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
know why they were eliminated from
 
04:04:30.510 --> 04:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
consideration of paying something
 
04:04:33.070 --> 04:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.309 --> 04:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
upkeep I don't want to speak for the uh
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
the committee that looked into this but
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
um really it was it was solely focused
 
04:04:44.349 --> 04:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
on and even even these flood control s
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
provide some kind of benefit so for
 
04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
example there's a there's a flood
 
04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
control site dam was built for flood
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
control but it um it also has uh has
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
development around it as well um and
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
there's also another site that has
 
04:05:00.830 --> 04:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
drinking water purposes as well so there
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
are still people benefiting from those
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
those impoundments so yes you could say
 
04:05:06.750 --> 04:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
there are Downstream communities that
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
benefit as well in fact um New Hampshire
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
has been working with the AG's office
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out those benefits
 
04:05:15.070 --> 04:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
with the state of Massachusetts because
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
certainly the Army Corps sites provide a
 
04:05:18.750 --> 04:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
benefit not only to the residents of New
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but to the state of M the
 
04:05:21.950 --> 04:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
residents of Massachusetts so the
 
04:05:23.309 --> 04:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that's been a
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
long ongoing process working on that but
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
um I I think the committee wanted to
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to focus on who truly is is
 
04:05:33.550 --> 04:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the vast majority of
 
04:05:33.560 --> 04:05:36.990 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the vast majority of
these

04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
empowerments anyone else Mr
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
Taylor your comments about the folks
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
Downstream from high Hazard dams are
 
04:05:47.670 --> 04:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
they aware of the change of situation
 
04:05:50.110 --> 04:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
that they are in high Hazard and uh are
 
04:05:52.590 --> 04:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
they being impacted uh with flood
 
04:05:52.600 --> 04:05:54.269 align:start position:0%
they being impacted uh with flood
insurance

04:05:54.269 --> 04:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:05:54.279 --> 04:05:55.790 align:start position:0%
insurance
accordingly

04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
so so when when there's a a house
 
04:06:00.790 --> 04:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
Downstream of a high Hazard Dam and say
 
04:06:03.630 --> 04:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
they they we we have to do so as part of
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
managing all these projects we have to
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
do all the emergency action plans which
 
04:06:08.910 --> 04:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
include all the mapping necessary and
 
04:06:10.389 --> 04:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
everything else to figure out who
 
04:06:12.349 --> 04:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
exactly is Downstream of these when
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
those maps are created
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
um they not only get distributed to uh
 
04:06:20.750 --> 04:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
to the dam safety program at Dees but
 
04:06:22.349 --> 04:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
also they get distributed to Homeland
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
Security all the state police local
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
police and everything else so should
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
there be a an incident they every the
 
04:06:31.710 --> 04:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
locals and everybody else can respond
 
04:06:33.870 --> 04:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
accordingly there are times that those
 
04:06:36.110 --> 04:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
Downstream people find out that they are
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
um within a inundation area but not not
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily there's certainly no
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
requirement on home sales or anything
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
else to notify that you were living
 
04:06:46.510 --> 04:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
Downstream of a high Hazard Dam nor do
 
04:06:50.269 --> 04:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
the uh FEMA flood insurance Maps reflect
 
04:06:52.269 --> 04:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
that so when when flood insurance maps
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
are created they're created based on a
 
04:06:56.149 --> 04:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
storm event moving through a particular
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
river system not necessarily on a dam
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
failing within that river system so when
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
we when we hear about flood insurance
 
04:07:05.790 --> 04:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
and those people who live within flood
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
areas designated by FEMA it doesn't take
 
04:07:11.710 --> 04:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
into account uh whether or not that is
 
04:07:14.750 --> 04:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
because if there's a dam Upstream or not
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple of sites that are
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
um that are originally built by Army
 
04:07:24.149 --> 04:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
Corps in which uh I can one for example
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's a site over in Farmington not
 
04:07:26.910 --> 04:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
owned by the state it's actually owned
 
04:07:28.510 --> 04:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
by the town of Farmington but it's a
 
04:07:30.070 --> 04:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
levy system in
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
which in order for the people Downstream
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
of that Levy not to have to pay flood
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
insurance the town of Farmington has to
 
04:07:39.870 --> 04:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
upkeep that Levy in order in order to
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that those people are exempt
 
04:07:42.630 --> 04:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
from flood insurance but there's no
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
program that is that is because it's an
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
Army Core site there's no program like
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
that for State
 
04:07:51.790 --> 04:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
sites so gentlemen I have one question
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
and poor Mr Bird's waiting to talk but
 
04:07:57.790 --> 04:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
um I know this committee has had bills
 
04:08:01.149 --> 04:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
before relating to Dam
 
04:08:03.550 --> 04:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
decommissioning um I'm sort of amazed
 
04:08:07.229 --> 04:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
that the percentage 250 or just to
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
create water and only 27 are to stop
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
floods what if we decommissioned all 200
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
50 dams you lower the water level and
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
then that would save like $60 million to
 
04:08:21.870 --> 04:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
have to repair them and replace them has
 
04:08:24.189 --> 04:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
that been looked at by this committee
 
04:08:26.990 --> 04:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
your commission or anybody just a
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
question I'll let Cory answer but real
 
04:08:32.590 --> 04:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
real quick uh yes we if the
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
communities in the legislature would
 
04:08:37.070 --> 04:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
accept that I would say two things
 
04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately a dam is is is here we're
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
talking hundreds of years and that as I
 
04:08:44.189 --> 04:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
think we're we're talking about about is
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
and the operation and maintenance is is
 
04:08:47.590 --> 04:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential so this is a gift
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
that keeps on giving so I agree in a
 
04:08:53.070 --> 04:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
vacuum removing dams like that would be
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
in the long term the cheapest way to go
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
but I will say even doing that cost
 
04:09:00.750 --> 04:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars and our experiences
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the local communities and this you
 
04:09:04.750 --> 04:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
know it is what it is uh there's a lot
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
of resistance to change like that to to
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
those empowerments going away again we
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
gave you some statistics on the the
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
amount of the water levels going down
 
04:09:12.840 --> 04:09:14.070 align:start position:0%
amount of the water levels going down
remember

04:09:14.070 --> 04:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:09:16.910 --> 04:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
with the influx of folks most of those
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
water body empowerments have people
 
04:09:21.990 --> 04:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
living on the water and they seem to
 
04:09:24.269 --> 04:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
eject they don't like to have mud flats
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
they like to have the water I think so
 
04:09:27.790 --> 04:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
so I I'm just stting the obvious that's
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
a I was smirking because that's kind of
 
04:09:31.870 --> 04:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
a political question right are you how
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
much pain are you willing to endure but
 
04:09:36.149 --> 04:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh but I but overall in a vacuum we
 
04:09:37.950 --> 04:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
actually absolutely do think that's the
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
right answer uh for the long-term uh
 
04:09:45.229 --> 04:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
cost if in a vacuum yes I understand and
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
didn't we have a bill follow up yes you
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
may um didn't we have a bill I think a
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
year or two years ago about uh selling
 
04:09:57.309 --> 04:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
some of these dams to the local towns
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't eliminate our problem to
 
04:10:01.469 --> 04:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
get them repaired right it just would
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
take it off the state and put it on the
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
towns correct I'm in favor of that
 
04:10:08.910 --> 04:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
certainly I thought you might be all
 
04:10:10.109 --> 04:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
right any other
 
04:10:12.910 --> 04:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
questions no okay thank you very much to
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
both of you appreciate it Mr birdie now
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
you're up you've been waiting patiently
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr chairman and I
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
apologize but uh my legacy is uh right
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
Church wrong Pew and I've done it more
 
04:10:43.389 --> 04:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
than once it's embarrassing when when
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
you go to an airport and to get on a
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
flight and you're a day early it's even
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
more embarrassing when you're a day late
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
and I've done both so uh I I previously
 
04:10:58.269 --> 04:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
for members of the committee I who might
 
04:11:01.149 --> 04:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
not have been here I I began my remarks
 
04:11:05.630 --> 04:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
by saying that um kind of a dual role uh
 
04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
I'm filling in for Jason stock executive
 
04:11:11.429 --> 04:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
director of the Timberland Owners
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
Association and you have testimony from
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
him um I served as a president of the
 
04:11:22.590 --> 04:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
association uh in the past and presently
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
I am on the policy committee and U we
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
you have our response that Jason has
 
04:11:36.189 --> 04:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
written so thank you uh and I would try
 
04:11:38.109 --> 04:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
to answer any of your questions it may
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
be in that but again um it's kind of the
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the and the in the uh
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
position of the Timberland owners I I'm
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%

and uh and in the past managed several
 
04:12:09.389 --> 04:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
thousands of Acres of Woodland uh
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh presently I only
 
04:12:17.309 --> 04:12:17.319 align:start position:0%
uh manage one major client uh my Farmer
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
firm is still active in and in managing
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
land throughout the state uh the one
 
04:12:26.830 --> 04:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
client that I'm here to discuss um owns
 
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
land uh throughout the state presently
 
04:12:30.199 --> 04:12:31.149 align:start position:0%
land uh throughout the state presently
about

04:12:31.149 --> 04:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:12:33.109 --> 04:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
17,500 Acres of
 
04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
Timberland um stretching from West
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
Stewarts down kind of a triangle over to
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
new dorham and Alton and then over to
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
Hill in Danbury and within that triangle
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh they own and manage as I mentioned
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
17,500 acres of land of which
 
04:12:54.309 --> 04:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
approximately one half is in
 
04:12:58.469 --> 04:12:58.479 align:start position:0%
conservation easement and currently uh
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
we are looking at placing another uh 470
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
acres in eement in Campton B and I will
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
get back to that and an additional uh
 
04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
1500 acres is under
 
04:13:14.349 --> 04:13:14.359 align:start position:0%
consideration um the property that I've
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in Campton uh has Campton
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
bog on it uh we I've been working on
 
04:13:25.469 --> 04:13:25.479 align:start position:0%
this easement uh since
 
04:13:29.109 --> 04:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
1989 um the original application was
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
turned down for the lack of funding
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
although it was heavily supported uh by
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh fishing game uh for the habitat of of
 
04:13:41.790 --> 04:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
mammals but also very important uh
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
location of the bog it supports a very
 
04:13:46.830 --> 04:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
active native trout
 
04:13:49.630 --> 04:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
population three major tributaries into
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
Campton bog uh come through our property
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
and so this land is under uh
 
04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
consideration and should be closed on
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
sometime in in the late summer or early
 
04:14:00.080 --> 04:14:01.710 align:start position:0%
sometime in in the late summer or early
fall

04:14:01.710 --> 04:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
fall
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
2025 uh the property that we have
 
04:14:08.109 --> 04:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
consists of about depending on how you
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
measure it and I I bear your Indulgence
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
I became aware of this bill on on Monday
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I don't have any prepared
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
comments but I was able to extract some
 
04:14:24.109 --> 04:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
information on the U amount of land with
 
04:14:29.469 --> 04:14:29.479 align:start position:0%
water Frontage uh and it it is about
 
04:14:34.149 --> 04:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
over 7,000 ft of standing water and in
 
04:14:38.429 --> 04:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
high water times it's about 10,200
 
04:14:41.109 --> 04:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
ft we have another property or the Green
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
Acres does in uh
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
went with through Hampshire on the
 
04:14:48.990 --> 04:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
outflow of Lowa Baker Pond which we have
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
an additional 3,200 feet the impact if I
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
read this bill correctly and again uh I
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
I ask for Indulgence because I just was
 
04:15:02.990 --> 04:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
became aware of it but the impact the
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
financial impact of this on on Green
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
Acres Woodland is a
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
minimum of
 
04:15:14.469 --> 04:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
$16,600 a year
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
and if all the Wetland is considered
 
04:15:17.520 --> 04:15:20.109 align:start position:0%
and if all the Wetland is considered
it's

04:15:20.109 --> 04:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:23.229 --> 04:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
20,700 uh dollars per
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
year I'm not in I'm not against the
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
importance of taking care of the dams I
 
04:15:32.670 --> 04:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
think it's been well representative and
 
04:15:36.750 --> 04:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
presented to to but I am I I the impact
 
04:15:39.790 --> 04:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
is financially killing we are putting an
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
easement on Campton bog for several
 
04:15:42.479 --> 04:15:43.590 align:start position:0%
easement on Campton bog for several
purposes

04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
one is the protection of critical
 
04:15:48.990 --> 04:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
habitat for for mammals and fish but
 
04:15:51.950 --> 04:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
also uh theyve giving up the development
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
potential outside of the of the bog um
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
which is quite valuable it's upin
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
Highwood hardwood and they're they're
 
04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
getting rid of any uh commercial or
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
residential improvements that could be
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
made to it so what we have is a a parel
 
04:16:12.269 --> 04:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
of land uh about a third of which is
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
impacted as either Wetland or standing
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
water and the remainder is we can't
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
develop it uh we have had several Timber
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
Harvest on this property over the last
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
40 years and presently we're standing
 
04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
with a a a divers uh timan ranging in ag
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
is from about 4 five years uh 5 years
 
04:16:37.630 --> 04:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
old to 40 years old the next major cut
 
04:16:40.109 --> 04:16:40.119 align:start position:0%
will be in about 20 years so there's
 
04:16:42.510 --> 04:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
really not a lot of income from this
 
04:16:42.520 --> 04:16:43.590 align:start position:0%
really not a lot of income from this
property

04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
and uh the taxes where it's under
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
current use is about uh $2 an acre a
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
year um the barain its total is about
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
470 Acres so you can do the math that
 
04:17:01.229 --> 04:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
taxes are about $8 or $900 a year um
 
04:17:04.189 --> 04:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
believe me this will be a killer so I I
 
04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
I'm just really have a lot of concern
 
04:17:10.750 --> 04:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
about the way this has been structured
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're about a half a mile to 34 of mile
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
with the standing water in yes you could
 
04:17:18.830 --> 04:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
get a canoe into the water but You' be
 
04:17:20.269 --> 04:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
dragging it through a lot of land and
 
04:17:22.510 --> 04:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
this land is open for the public will be
 
04:17:24.030 --> 04:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
open for the public it's open for
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling it's open for hunting and
 
04:17:29.870 --> 04:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's open for fishing of which quite
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
frankly the client gets no income from
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
it it's free to the to the public
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
so I think and I don't know how other
 
04:17:43.870 --> 04:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
people who have land similar to ours was
 
04:17:46.510 --> 04:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
are going to be impacted but that is a
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
money in 10 years that's $200,000 if you
 
04:17:54.670 --> 04:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
go with a higher or
 
04:17:59.790 --> 04:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
$160,000 in 10 years and uh that is not
 
04:18:02.550 --> 04:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
financially feasible uh for for them to
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
retain this land uh maybe the state
 
04:18:07.229 --> 04:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
would like to buy it and we've had
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
support on the with fishing game on
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
working with them on the easement along
 
04:18:16.269 --> 04:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
with the forest Society so I I think a
 
04:18:19.910 --> 04:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
careful analysis uh of where this money
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
is coming from and how it's impacting it
 
04:18:24.510 --> 04:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I I recognize there may be people
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
that do have a a benefit from the dams
 
04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
will have cabins on it or have
 
04:18:32.910 --> 04:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
approaches for for their docks and so
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
forth but I think this is is going a
 
04:18:39.149 --> 04:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
little bit much and I I I think that it
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
requires a little bit more study of how
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
this is going to impact several land
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
owners whose land are in current use and
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
have no intention of probably ever
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
developing it and have no use of it
 
04:18:52.590 --> 04:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
other than having the benefit of having
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
water Frontage so I thank you for your
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
Indulgence and I'll try to watch my
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
schedule a little bit better next time
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr
 
04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
birdie representative Darby thank you Mr
 
04:19:07.870 --> 04:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
just I want to be clear you your client
 
04:19:13.229 --> 04:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
has property that's on a
 
04:19:16.750 --> 04:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
an impoundment that has correct it's a
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
with a with a state owned Dam and on
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
this empowerment as well are other
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
cabins and other um you know Residential
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
Properties is we got two properties that
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
I know of uh one is in Wentworth on just
 
04:19:31.950 --> 04:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
on the outflow of lower Baker Pond
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's 3200 running feet along along
 
04:19:38.590 --> 04:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
that and then Campton bog is depending
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
on how what is wet land and what is
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
water Frontage standing water is about
 
04:19:45.070 --> 04:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
about 70 7200
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
ft and and then if you take the wet area
 
04:19:49.870 --> 04:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
that certain times of year it's over
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
10,000 ft and as I read the bill as I
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
understand it again U it the variation
 
04:20:00.630 --> 04:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
that minimum is about
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
$16,600 on the two properties I noted it
 
04:20:07.229 --> 04:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
could be as high as $20,000 a year
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%

removed what's the impact to your uh
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
line the impact would be
 
04:20:26.429 --> 04:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
minimum the impact would be uh would a
 
04:20:29.070 --> 04:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
long ways toward destroying the habitat

resources Recreation and development
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
committee so thank you for having me
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
here today uh before I get into my brief
 
04:21:21.109 --> 04:21:21.119 align:start position:0%
testimony I just want to answer a few
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
questions for people as they had it uh
 
04:21:27.550 --> 04:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
to your question regarding the
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh 27 flood control dams and how the
 
04:21:36.109 --> 04:21:36.119 align:start position:0%
committee decided whether or not to tax
 
04:21:38.189 --> 04:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
the people that weren't on waterfronts
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
the committee did look at that and the
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
if the gates are open it removes that
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
flood risk from those people Downstream
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
so the committee the study committee had
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
determined that because those gates are
 
04:21:51.750 --> 04:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
most often open they don't benefit
 
04:21:53.149 --> 04:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily from those dams and
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
therefore wouldn't be a part of that
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
structure uh the second thing that I'd
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
like to address is the concerns of the
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
testifier before me uh if we give Dees
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
The rulemaking Authority in this bill
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
then they would have the leeway to be
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
able to determine which of those
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
properties are hash out all those
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
details that he had he had concerns with
 
04:22:14.269 --> 04:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
and I think Dees is more than willing to
 
04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
hash out those details and are looking
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
forward to doing that um Mr chairman I'm
 
04:22:22.109 --> 04:22:22.119 align:start position:0%
here because those dams are in critical
 
04:22:24.750 --> 04:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
condition and are a important piece to
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
the economy of our state the Lakes the
 
04:22:30.030 --> 04:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
waterfronts the fish and the Fisheries
 
04:22:33.109 --> 04:22:33.119 align:start position:0%
the swimming and the canoeing there's a
 
04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
lot of money uh probably an
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
indeterminable amount that is brought in
 
04:22:39.870 --> 04:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
to our economy from these dams and I
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
would be concerned with moving forward
 
04:22:43.950 --> 04:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
as decommit with decommissioning as a
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
solution you know how silly is it that
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have these dams here from the mid 18
 
04:22:51.149 --> 04:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
late 1800s that haven't been addressed
 
04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
in so long uh I think it's just time for
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
us to find some fee structure and way to
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
address these dams and representative
 
04:22:59.550 --> 04:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
dun thank you so much for your hard work
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
on this piece of legislation and
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative leechman he's too humble
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh he has served as chair of division
 
04:23:05.920 --> 04:23:06.830 align:start position:0%
uh he has served as chair of division
one

04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:23:11.550 --> 04:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
for uh a long time now and and has been
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
on the finance committee for a long time
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
and is someone who's at least tries to
 
04:23:17.469 --> 04:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
be very careful with the money and so I
 
04:23:18.870 --> 04:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
would when he comes forward with
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
something which has money in it I I uh
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
am generally supportive of it because I
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
know he's done his due diligence to make
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
sure that this is fiscally responsible
 
04:23:28.510 --> 04:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire
 
04:23:30.429 --> 04:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
representative leishman has put hundreds
 
04:23:32.269 --> 04:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
of hours of work into this piece of
 
04:23:33.630 --> 04:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
legislation as you have as well
 
04:23:35.070 --> 04:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
representative done and I hope there's
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
some way to help educate the committee
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
and I would hope any of you who are
 
04:23:41.670 --> 04:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
interested in the study committee report
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
would go to the for floor and and ask an
 
04:23:46.109 --> 04:23:46.119 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald to take you into the room
 
04:23:47.710 --> 04:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
where all those study committee reports
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
collect dust and uh read that report
 
04:23:53.590 --> 04:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
because I think it was well put and I
 
04:23:55.109 --> 04:23:55.119 align:start position:0%
think they did a very good job on that
 
04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
study committee so I'm here today to
 
04:23:58.990 --> 04:23:59.000 align:start position:0%

04:24:00.189 --> 04:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
damn important
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
one and I hope that all of you will see
 
04:24:05.309 --> 04:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
that and find some way to give Dees
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
rulle making Authority and make sure
 
04:24:08.670 --> 04:24:08.680 align:start position:0%

the chair has said that we are opposed

to the bill as drafted for the reasons
 
04:24:59.550 --> 04:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned um we've reviewed it
 
04:25:04.750 --> 04:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
and we uh failed to see as was mentioned
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor where uh open space lands
 
04:25:11.229 --> 04:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
with an easement whether it be under
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
current use or a or some type of uh
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
conservation easement are Exempted it
 
04:25:20.670 --> 04:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
simply says read line 25 upon show line
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
upon all taxable waterfronts maintained
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.640 --> 04:25:34.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:37.469 --> 04:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
that I guess I'll jump to the piece on
 
04:25:40.590 --> 04:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
the ru making um for you to leave in Ru
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
making We Believe would be huge mistake
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
um I can't believe it's a mine that the
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
department wants to go into enter
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
especially developing rules to raise
 
04:25:54.670 --> 04:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
funds for their own agency that's
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
language that should be in this bill if
 
04:25:58.870 --> 04:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
that if if those lands are
 
04:25:58.880 --> 04:26:02.349 align:start position:0%
that if if those lands are
exempt

04:26:02.349 --> 04:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:05.910 --> 04:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
um we have the one of the bigger qu big
 
04:26:08.670 --> 04:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
questions our members had as well is the
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
need to clarify is what is impounded
 
04:26:14.590 --> 04:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
water under the under the the taxable
 
04:26:17.469 --> 04:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
water front um as far as as you is
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
probably aware uh that the state's Prime
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
Farmland is concentrated along along our
 
04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
River corridors uh we have we have uh
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
farmers in the state that that own uh
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know considerable Frontage on those
 
04:26:33.670 --> 04:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
rivers and you know a quarter mile of
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
Frontage is an assessment of over $2,000
 
04:26:39.630 --> 04:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
a year which which our our Farmers
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
cannot grow enough you know corn and
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
crop stuff to cover something like that
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
that that that needs to be clarified uh
 
04:26:49.710 --> 04:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
to give you an example I was reading in
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
some of the the uh Department of
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
literature where talking about the the
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh pasca quog which uh river which is
 
04:27:02.349 --> 04:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
over in New Boston area and it and it it
 
04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
read There was language said it was uh
 
04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
the dam over there one of the dams was
 
04:27:09.550 --> 04:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
classified as impounding close to six
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
six miles of of the river so that that
 
04:27:14.510 --> 04:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
is there is a some type of
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
classification of impounded water on
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
these these rivers from what I what I
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
understand and uh again just to
 
04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
reiterate that our the the open space
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
lands the state are not deriving the
 
04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
same benefit as as some you know
 
04:27:32.910 --> 04:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
especially the recreational users are
 
04:27:36.830 --> 04:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
are benefiting from um there's a and
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
they they they cannot justify a return
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh based on the additional uh tax
 
04:27:44.109 --> 04:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
revenue not to mention that the the
 
04:27:46.149 --> 04:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
water quality benefits of open land
 
04:27:49.149 --> 04:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
along these shorefront the the tourism
 
04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
provides to the state is as as U as well
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
as recreational opportunities and I I
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for attention I'll leave it at
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chair any questions
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
testimony Matt Ley from the forest
 
04:28:09.830 --> 04:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
Society it doesn't say if you're opposed
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:18.389 --> 04:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr chair
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
yet and I'm not trying to evade that
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
question um and I'll explain in just a
 
04:28:25.710 --> 04:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
second but you know we understand that
 
04:28:27.870 --> 04:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
the problem this bill
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
is attempting to address is a major
 
04:28:33.630 --> 04:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
problem for our state and representative
 
04:28:37.389 --> 04:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
leean noted the total cost to fix these
 
04:28:39.309 --> 04:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
dams I mean that's a staggering amount
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
so we know that but we do have
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
we have a concern and a question you
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
know the concern is really um and Mr
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
birdie already talked about that and so
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
did raw but you know land that is
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
undeveloped open um that's you know AB
 
04:28:59.149 --> 04:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
buts the Shoreland or near Shoreland you
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
know those types of properties do
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
provide really important ecological
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits for you know
 
04:29:06.479 --> 04:29:08.269 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits for you know
flood

04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
flood
 
04:29:11.109 --> 04:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
mitigation you know helping to sort of
 
04:29:13.830 --> 04:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
protect and and you know the the Water
 
04:29:16.870 --> 04:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
Resources whether um you know in the
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
ground or you know from that water body
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
so you know those types of properties
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
are very important and our concern is
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill is structured you
 
04:29:28.750 --> 04:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
know we may be unintentionally creating
 
04:29:31.389 --> 04:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
disincentives for you know a land owner
 
04:29:33.790 --> 04:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
to maybe put their land in some type of
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know open space status whether with
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
an easement or just in current use um so
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about that point and
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
secondly is really the question of you
 
04:29:49.389 --> 04:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
know what properties would be subject to
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
this fee and I I do agree with
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative Darby you know our read
 
04:29:54.750 --> 04:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
of the build is that you know land and
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
current use would be subject um to the
 
04:30:01.070 --> 04:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
fee and again you know are we going to
 
04:30:02.309 --> 04:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
again have that
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
unintentional um impact on on what we're
 
04:30:07.349 --> 04:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
trying to do to you know to keep some
 
04:30:09.790 --> 04:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
Land open and undeveloped near these
 
04:30:12.630 --> 04:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
really important water bodies
 
04:30:15.630 --> 04:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
um and just speaking for the fores study
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
so we are a nonprofit um although but we
 
04:30:22.229 --> 04:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
have chosen actually to put the land we
 
04:30:26.070 --> 04:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
own in current use status and sort of
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
what is not clear to us because there is
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
actually you know for a
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit there's not a sort of
 
04:30:36.990 --> 04:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
automatic exemption to that tax status
 
04:30:39.389 --> 04:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
they have to you know proactively apply
 
04:30:42.109 --> 04:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
to the local town you know for tax
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
exempt and so but we have chosen to put
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
our land in current use instead of you
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
know exempting it from taxes and we're
 
04:30:52.030 --> 04:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
not clear if the bill you know how our
 
04:30:54.670 --> 04:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
property or how we would be treated um
 
04:30:56.510 --> 04:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
since we do put it in current use and
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
therefore we are taxable um but we're
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
also a nonprofit so we're just not I
 
04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
guess not clear um how ultimately we
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
would be treated under the bill so you
 
04:31:11.590 --> 04:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
know we would urge the committee Tobe
 
04:31:14.550 --> 04:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
try to address these these points but
 
04:31:16.349 --> 04:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take any questions any
 
04:31:18.349 --> 04:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
04:31:21.429 --> 04:31:21.439 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Association of Realtors the
 
04:31:51.790 --> 04:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
Realtors oppose this bill
 
04:31:55.630 --> 04:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
um imposing a tax base on Shoreline

Frontage for properties benefiting from
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
State maintain dams raises several
 
04:32:01.389 --> 04:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding private property
 
04:32:03.149 --> 04:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
rights Equitable Taxation and the
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
distribution of benefits so targeting
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
only waterfront property owners for Dam
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance funding is inequitable as it
 
04:32:12.189 --> 04:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
disregards the broader community that
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
benefits from the Dam's existence
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
including recreational users and
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
businesses that gain from tourism and
 
04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
Water Resources dams provide advantages
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
that extend beyond adjacent Property
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
Owners such as flood control
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunities and
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
ecological benefits funding their
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance should be a collective
 
04:32:32.189 --> 04:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility not solely born by a
 
04:32:35.309 --> 04:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
subset of property owners introducing a
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
per foot Shoreline tax adds an
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
additional Financial strain on property
 
04:32:42.269 --> 04:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
owners potentially leading to increased
 
04:32:44.750 --> 04:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
it will in increase property taxes and
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
make ownersh ownership less affordable
 
04:32:50.229 --> 04:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
and implementing this tax could set a
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
precedent for additional levies on
 
04:32:53.389 --> 04:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
property owners for public
 
04:32:55.510 --> 04:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure leading to further
 
04:32:57.630 --> 04:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
erosion of private property rights and
 
04:32:59.790 --> 04:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
increased financial obligation without
 
04:33:02.550 --> 04:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
corresponding individual benefits and
 
04:33:04.029 --> 04:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
last year I was here in front of this
 
04:33:06.789 --> 04:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
committee for some other Shoreland bills
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to reiterate that
 
04:33:12.750 --> 04:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
this is not just the large more affluent
 
04:33:15.910 --> 04:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
homes on water bodies these are a lot of
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%

04:33:21.869 --> 04:33:21.879 align:start position:0%
to pay our tax bill every single time
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%

04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
able to answer but there are things that
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
have changed uh since the last two um
 
04:35:21.150 --> 04:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
bills we put in on this and um I think
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
we um might be able to do something
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
about it this time for hobbyists and um
 
04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
I would like to allow him to come up
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
well before he comes up any questions
 
04:35:36.789 --> 04:35:36.799 align:start position:0%
for the representative or she's
 
04:35:39.750 --> 04:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
deferring I am deferring okay thank you

again giving me the opportunity to speak
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
before this committee my name is Drew

melmont I'm a data scientist for IBM and
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
I'm from Hollis New Hampshire I'll try
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
to keep my remarks brief since I've
 
04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
testified at length on this topic the
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
last several years and have included
 
04:36:10.029 --> 04:36:10.039 align:start position:0%
more information in my written testimony
 
04:36:11.189 --> 04:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
to give you some background in my
 
04:36:13.150 --> 04:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
license Private Pilot with over 250
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
hours as well as one of the first
 
04:36:16.150 --> 04:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
licensed commercial drone pilots in the
 
04:36:18.269 --> 04:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
United States I have deep ties to the
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Aviation community and I'm
 
04:36:22.429 --> 04:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
from a family of Pilots my dad is a
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
pilot my younger brothers are both
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
Pilots my uncle is a pilot my
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
grandfather was a pilot lots of pilots
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
from about the age of eight I've been a
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
model airplane or drone pilot and many
 
04:36:35.310 --> 04:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
times I'd fly on state Parkland so this
 
04:36:37.869 --> 04:36:37.879 align:start position:0%
would have been in the early 2000s in
 
04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
2020 it came to my attention that New
 
04:36:42.510 --> 04:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Park Ed posting
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
information and signage outright Banning
 
04:36:47.230 --> 04:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
drones that kicked off my Outreach to
 
04:36:48.990 --> 04:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
several legislators including
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lisa post and
 
04:36:53.070 --> 04:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
Representative Keith Ammon who are both
 
04:36:55.830 --> 04:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this current bill HB
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
644 in the spirit of keeping this
 
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
concise I'm going to make seven key
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
points number one there's effectively no
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
permitting process for launching and
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
Landing drones in state parks no matter
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
what you hear in other testimonies this
 
04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
is a blanket drone bin as a knee-jerk
 
04:37:13.709 --> 04:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
reaction to drone Dr number two the
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
White Mountain National Forest allows
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
drones on most of its land provided that
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
the pilot has the correct certifications
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
and follows the Federal Aviation
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
regulations also known as the fars and
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
there's a streamlined permitting process
 
04:37:29.390 --> 04:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
for commercial use the spirit of this
 
04:37:32.429 --> 04:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
bill HB 644 parallels the national
 
04:37:32.439 --> 04:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
bill HB 644 parallels the national
forest

04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
forest
 
04:37:36.629 --> 04:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
policies many states uh number three
 
04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
many states already allow drones in most
 
04:37:42.269 --> 04:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
or some state parks this includes
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
California Utah Texas Colorado
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Washington Oregon and
 
04:37:51.789 --> 04:37:51.799 align:start position:0%
Alaska a blanket drone ban is an insult
 
04:37:54.510 --> 04:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
to the Live Free or Die state number
 
04:37:57.150 --> 04:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
four the state cannot regulate Federal
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
airspace the state can only regulate
 
04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
launching and Landing drones any attempt
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
to put altitude restrictions would
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
likely lead to legal trouble in 2017 the
 
04:38:08.349 --> 04:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
FAA sued the city of Newton
 
04:38:10.269 --> 04:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because the city attempted
 
04:38:12.269 --> 04:38:12.279 align:start position:0%
to regulate Federal drone
 
04:38:15.750 --> 04:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
airspace number five people are already
 
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
using drones in New Hampshire state
 
04:38:19.750 --> 04:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
parks there are hundreds of videos on
 
04:38:21.510 --> 04:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
YouTube of drone flights in New
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state parks let's regulate and
 
04:38:27.629 --> 04:38:27.639 align:start position:0%
keep this activity safe number six we
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
allow hunting in New Hampshire state
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
parks which is both noisier and
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
considerably more dangerous than drones
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and lastly number seven I want
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
to preserve the opportunities that I had
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
as a child for future Generations drones
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
are an excellent education opportunity
 
04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
for children in a great way to spark
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
interest in stem Fields therefore I ask
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
the committee to support an ought to
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation on HB 644 thank you
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm open to any questions questions
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
speaker I'm going to ask the question of
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Darby and then we'll go to you
 
04:39:10.590 --> 04:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
representative Orion thank you Mr chair
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:39:15.830 --> 04:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
question um as a um commercial uh drone
 
04:39:18.269 --> 04:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
um pilot are and licensed drone pilot
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
are you interested in um the licensure
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
like license getting a license to um
 
04:39:25.590 --> 04:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
launch these or are you interested in
 
04:39:28.590 --> 04:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
this from a um U sort of a hobby
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
perspective because this bill seems to
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
do both permit per permit hobbyists and
 
04:39:37.708 --> 04:39:37.718 align:start position:0%
provide for some licensure
 
04:39:40.270 --> 04:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
licensing yeah My ATT is both uh
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
primarily this is a hobby for me I like
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
to take photos and um for non-commercial
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
use post them and save them and hang
 
04:39:50.708 --> 04:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
them up on my wall but um these are two
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
use cases for drones and we do need to
 
04:39:57.070 --> 04:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
have um rules for for both cases and I
 
04:39:58.510 --> 04:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
do have the license and I do want to
 
04:40:01.230 --> 04:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
have that ability to also take part in
 
04:40:06.510 --> 04:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
well representative Ryan I said I'd go
 
04:40:12.868 --> 04:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
to you next thank you Mr chair I just
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
would like to say I appreciate your
 
04:40:16.990 --> 04:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
cleaning up that bill this makes it um a
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
whole lot more um easier to understand
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
and answered all those questions that we
 
04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
had before thank you representative
 
04:40:28.830 --> 04:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
for taking the question uh is there
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
maximum Deo level uh under any
 
04:40:36.750 --> 04:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
regulation if not what is the average
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
decimal level of a good siiz drone it
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
can be anywhere
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it can be
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 60 to 70 DB so it's
 
04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
usually less than traffic noise outside
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
and in comparison I don't have the sheet
 
04:40:52.830 --> 04:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
in front of me but on my written
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe I have the the
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
decibel number for for guns it's it's
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
much higher it's more like 90 to over
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
100 Debs depending on how close you
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
are any other
 
04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you uh Brian Wilson
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.628 --> 04:41:35.638 align:start position:0%

some testimony on behalf of the
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
resources and the division of Parks and
 
04:41:50.910 --> 04:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
Recreation uh we uh would respectively
 
04:41:52.030 --> 04:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh like to provide you with the
 
04:41:55.070 --> 04:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
following information when reviewing new
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
or competing uses in state park lands
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
the dncr considers the recreational
 
04:42:01.708 --> 04:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
experience of visitors in state parks
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
campgrounds and trails protecting the
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
quality of that experience is one of the
 
04:42:08.510 --> 04:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
purposes of our administrative
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
rules with respect to the impacts of
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
drones on other recreationalists I asked
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
the question of what potential impact
 
04:42:17.310 --> 04:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
would a drone have on other recreational
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
users who are otherwise expecting to be
 
04:42:22.030 --> 04:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy a quiet experience in
 
04:42:24.390 --> 04:42:24.400 align:start position:0%

04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the department lands include rules
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
relative to uh Public Access uh the

and uh and and and others although this
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
bill provide uh prohibits flights that
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
intentionally interfere with the
 
04:42:55.150 --> 04:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable use and enjoyment of the park
 
04:42:56.670 --> 04:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
by others the definition of this
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
provision is unclear and
 
04:43:01.310 --> 04:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
unenforceable the bill also prohibits
 
04:43:03.150 --> 04:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
the use of drones with the intent to
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
conduct video surveillance of private
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
citizens in state parks without prior uh

consent of the persons being surveilled
 
04:43:13.868 --> 04:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
we believe that this pres uh provision
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
is also unenforceable and that a
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
visitor's privacy could be
 
04:43:17.600 --> 04:43:19.430 align:start position:0%

impacted with respect to commercial use
 
04:43:25.868 --> 04:43:25.878 align:start position:0%
um we have already in place a process
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
that grants drone use with the issuance
 
04:43:30.430 --> 04:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
of a special use permit through our
 
04:43:33.550 --> 04:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
administrative rule process um within
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
the testimony that I provided our
 
04:43:37.830 --> 04:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
several examples of just uh permits that
 
04:43:40.190 --> 04:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
we have issued within the last year uh
 
04:43:45.150 --> 04:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
for individual or groups um who have um
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
SE seek permission uh to operate a drone
 
04:43:50.830 --> 04:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
within State Park
 
04:43:53.708 --> 04:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
bounds the bill uh further authorizes
 
04:43:56.070 --> 04:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
the department to charge a retrieval fee
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
of not more than
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
$100 this fee may not fully cover the
 
04:44:02.708 --> 04:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
cost of Staff time that would take staff
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
away from their regular duties and
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
responsibilities from our Park visitors
 
04:44:08.550 --> 04:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
additionally staff would be held liable
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
for damage of drones during retrieval
 
04:44:13.590 --> 04:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
the bill authorizes the department to
 
04:44:16.510 --> 04:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
charge a drone operator $25 per day for
 
04:44:18.910 --> 04:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
flights that occur in state parks the
 
04:44:21.070 --> 04:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
division of state parks is operationally
 
04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
self-funded and as such um we are
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
authorized to set fees pursuant to RSA
 
04:44:26.480 --> 04:44:28.150 align:start position:0%

04:44:30.990 --> 04:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
a3g um through the fiscal committee's
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
approval and um that helps us to uh
 
04:44:36.750 --> 04:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
maximize our revenues and adjust fees
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
accordingly to market conditions and
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
trends that are common practice in the

04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:44:44.270 --> 04:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
industry uh this bill circumvents the
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
Department's established procedures to
 
04:44:48.270 --> 04:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
set fees for Access and use of of the
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
park system we respectfully request that
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
the rules related to the recreational
 
04:44:56.110 --> 04:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
drone use in state parks be established
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
under our administrative rule process
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
and uh we would would request that any
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
fees related to drone use is established
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
um through our current uh process under
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 2116a uh that includes review and
 
04:45:12.510 --> 04:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
approval of the fiscal committee thank
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to provide
 
04:45:16.830 --> 04:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
testimony on this on this bill and I'm
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you have
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Wilson we'll start with
 
04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative Sergeant then go to
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
representative Dupont thank you Mr
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have a lack of knowledge
 
04:45:29.590 --> 04:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
of the current laws or regulations or I
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
guess State park rules on drones could
 
04:45:33.230 --> 04:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
you let me know what is the current
 
04:45:36.030 --> 04:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
state of the law um well I believe we
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
have somebody from the Department of
 
04:45:39.788 --> 04:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
Safety to he to speak to um ongoing
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
Legislation during this session Rel
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
relative to the laws and uh when this
 
04:45:47.310 --> 04:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
bill has been brought up in Prior
 
04:45:50.670 --> 04:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
sessions uh as well to uh there was a
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Department of
 
04:45:55.868 --> 04:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh relative to uh the
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
laws what we are strictly trying to
 
04:46:04.110 --> 04:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
control and enforce is the um operating
 
04:46:07.550 --> 04:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
and the The Landing or and um launching
 
04:46:09.550 --> 04:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
within the bounds of the state parks as
 
04:46:11.788 --> 04:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
was uh mentioned in previous testimony
 
04:46:14.310 --> 04:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
here the control over what happens in
 
04:46:18.030 --> 04:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
airspace is not our specialty um so it
 
04:46:20.590 --> 04:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
is it is a challenge for us to keep Pace
 
04:46:22.910 --> 04:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
with kind of ongoing with with with the
 
04:46:25.390 --> 04:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
industry of that and uh you know the the
 
04:46:27.868 --> 04:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
the kind of continuing prevalence of uh
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
demand for it so um I don't have a lot
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
of great specific answers relative
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
to that question sorry followup is it
 
04:46:40.430 --> 04:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
allowed right now in state parks can you
 
04:46:42.430 --> 04:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
land and take off a drone in the state
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
park you can you can through our
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
administrative rule process you can get
 
04:46:49.590 --> 04:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative Dupont thank you Mr
 
04:46:57.150 --> 04:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr Wilson who's responsible for
 
04:46:59.470 --> 04:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
enforcing these
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
rules uh thank you for the question so
 
04:47:06.548 --> 04:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh so um it's uh ultimately it it's the
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the park management
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
staff um in in this case they at uh
 
04:47:13.110 --> 04:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
management staff that are placed at a
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
particular Park uh they're responsible
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
for reinforcing all of our rules uh of
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the park system um we have had
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
instances uh where we rely on the local
 
04:47:26.510 --> 04:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh police force or fishing game or the
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
state police um when um there is lack of
 
04:47:35.830 --> 04:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
compliance and our authority to um it um
 
04:47:39.270 --> 04:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
enforce laws does not go very far so um
 
04:47:41.070 --> 04:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
when we get to that kind of that test
 
04:47:43.030 --> 04:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
point is when that's when we we bring in
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to help support
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
us yeah so for the benefit of those new
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
members on this committee because we've
 
04:47:56.990 --> 04:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
had drone bills for many years my memory
 
04:48:01.470 --> 04:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe um Mr Wilson can correct me if
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
I'm incorrect but it was
 
04:48:06.150 --> 04:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned once the Drone which is an
 
04:48:07.868 --> 04:48:07.878 align:start position:0%
unmanned They Don't Really call him
 
04:48:10.990 --> 04:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
drone in statute unmanned
 
04:48:14.708 --> 04:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
flight something um once it's in the sky
 
04:48:18.030 --> 04:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
it's the FAA that has control over the
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
sky we have no control over the sky what
 
04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
we were told last year was We can
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
control if we let them take off in the
 
04:48:30.910 --> 04:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
park and launch but uh from what we had
 
04:48:34.270 --> 04:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
testimony before if you're not in the
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
park you can be next to it on your
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
friend's land launch your drone and fly
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
it over the park and we have no control
 
04:48:45.430 --> 04:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
over it the dncr doesn't have control
 
04:48:47.310 --> 04:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
because it's in the sky am I correct
 
04:48:51.030 --> 04:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
about that yes yes that's correct so
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
just so you know that we don't have
 
04:48:56.830 --> 04:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
unlimited Authority once it's up in the
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
air um representative
 
04:49:02.670 --> 04:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you um
 
04:49:04.110 --> 04:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
04:49:04.120 --> 04:49:06.110 align:start position:0%
for taking my
question

04:49:06.110 --> 04:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:49:09.030 --> 04:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
um sorry just blinked on my question so
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
um you previously went through rule
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
making for for this process um can you
 
04:49:19.390 --> 04:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
talk about uh the um how you resulted at
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
um restricting it um uh restricting
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
takeoffs and landings um across all
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
state parks based on the public hearings
 
04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
um so we are actually bringing that
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
through the rul making process right now
 
04:49:33.070 --> 04:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
as we speak we are working on that so we
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
did a comprehensive revision uh to our
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rules um over the last
 
04:49:40.350 --> 04:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
year or so and that will'll be be coming
 
04:49:42.750 --> 04:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
forward Ward through uh the jail car
 
04:49:45.548 --> 04:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
process here um over the next several
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
months um I believe we're looking at a
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
public hearing date um I I don't want to
 
04:49:51.670 --> 04:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
say that I know I know it was in the
 
04:49:53.948 --> 04:49:53.958 align:start position:0%
near future I think sometime in March so
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
so there's uh components relative to
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
that in terms of Outreach and
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
notification that we're working through
 
04:50:03.070 --> 04:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
as we speak that prior to that being uh
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
drones we were working off of a a
 
04:50:07.868 --> 04:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
department policy for that uh but to
 
04:50:10.948 --> 04:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
further strengthen this relative to Dr
 
04:50:12.548 --> 04:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
and other things that were not captured
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
through the administrative rules we were
 
04:50:17.070 --> 04:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
operating at a on a policy level um so
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
we're we're working on incorporating
 
04:50:21.628 --> 04:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
that language now C currently thank you
 
04:50:24.350 --> 04:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair
 
04:50:28.750 --> 04:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
um is there um can you imagine a case
 
04:50:32.590 --> 04:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
where um the policy is not sort of black
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
and white where um drone um UAV use is
 
04:50:39.548 --> 04:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
allowed in some areas but not others you
 
04:50:42.788 --> 04:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
know less uh you know less popular areas
 
04:50:46.230 --> 04:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
something like that um well as with
 
04:50:49.868 --> 04:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
every rule it's um never black and white
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
when it it it it something becomes
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
challenged and and you know we're trying
 
04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
we attempt to enforce something um it is
 
04:51:00.750 --> 04:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
literally usually on a case-by casee
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
basis relative to the nuances of that
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
particular example um a couple things
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
that I could say so uh one of the prior
 
04:51:11.430 --> 04:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
speakers U mentioned uh that drone use
 
04:51:14.350 --> 04:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
is allowed in US Forest Service property
 
04:51:16.390 --> 04:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
that that is correct um however the
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
National Park Service has a different
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
policy where is they only allow it
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
through permitting so there the the
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
difference there is relative to
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
generally the the the expectation that
 
04:51:31.350 --> 04:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
park space is going to be generally more
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh populated with people and and
 
04:51:37.628 --> 04:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
recreators than an an open um you know
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
natural resources Back Country type uh
 
04:51:41.910 --> 04:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
space like you like the White Mountain
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
National Forest for instance so um
 
04:51:47.948 --> 04:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
that's where you know I could see you
 
04:51:49.948 --> 04:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
know plenty of examples where there
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
there probably would not be a general
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
impact uh to regular visitors on you
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
know either a very quiet day in in a
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
state park somewhere or somewhere where
 
04:52:02.590 --> 04:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's being operated discreetly or in the
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
back country we have other rules uh that
 
04:52:06.910 --> 04:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
are like this as well too for instance
 
04:52:09.788 --> 04:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
um walking pets off leash um that is
 
04:52:11.390 --> 04:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
also something that that is permitted
 
04:52:13.390 --> 04:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
within state parks but the the language
 
04:52:15.548 --> 04:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
within the regulations speaks to
 
04:52:18.310 --> 04:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
language around kind of remote areas and
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
such and and lack of people so it
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
becomes a judgment call um so and then
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
when that becomes a judgment call that
 
04:52:27.590 --> 04:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
also becomes an issue for staff to you
 
04:52:31.030 --> 04:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
know when to when that needs to be
 
04:52:34.030 --> 04:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
enforced yeah any other questions from
 
04:52:36.510 --> 04:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilson Mr
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:52:40.110 --> 04:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
for your question broad my ignorance but
 
04:52:41.430 --> 04:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
how many state parks are there and
 
04:52:43.830 --> 04:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
What's the total acreage uh we have we
 
04:52:46.510 --> 04:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
manage 93 properties across the state
 
04:52:49.948 --> 04:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
and um between uh State Forest
 
04:52:52.030 --> 04:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
reservations and State Park reservations
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
I believe it is approximately 250,000
 
04:52:54.680 --> 04:52:56.430 align:start position:0%
I believe it is approximately 250,000
Acres

04:52:56.430 --> 04:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
Acres
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
yeah anyone else saying none thank you
 
04:53:02.030 --> 04:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilson
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
you I have one more card uh Department
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
of Safety Christopher ball in opposition
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:18.750 --> 04:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Christopher ball
 
04:53:22.110 --> 04:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the department of
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
safety I'm a trooper uh employed by the
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
state police and I'm assigned to our
 
04:53:27.868 --> 04:53:27.878 align:start position:0%
Aviation unit uh the reason I'm here
 
04:53:30.270 --> 04:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
today is really just to bring forward um
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
potential uh issue or just something the
 
04:53:34.030 --> 04:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
committee should be aware of when uh
 
04:53:36.310 --> 04:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
considering this legislation going
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
forward um and I apologies if you
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
already aware of this but there are two
 
04:53:44.670 --> 04:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
other bills one within the Senate SB 49
 
04:53:47.708 --> 04:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
and one within the house uh House Bill
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
468 uh regarding the use of drones in
 
04:53:52.510 --> 04:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and specifically what that
 
04:53:55.230 --> 04:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
legislation is going to speak to is to
 
04:53:57.868 --> 04:53:57.878 align:start position:0%
defining uh crimes and penalties for
 
04:53:59.548 --> 04:53:59.558 align:start position:0%
those who choose to use drones in a
 
04:54:02.548 --> 04:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
nefarious way within New Hampshire um
 
04:54:05.070 --> 04:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
prior to uh this and I think it's been
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
discussed lately here is that um law
 
04:54:09.150 --> 04:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement New Hampshire hasn't had a
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
lot of um recourse um up until this
 
04:54:16.110 --> 04:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
point uh to do anything with people that
 
04:54:18.750 --> 04:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
might be using drones nefariously um for
 
04:54:20.110 --> 04:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
illegal means either you know flying
 
04:54:22.270 --> 04:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
them recklessly flying them in places
 
04:54:24.110 --> 04:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
where they're restricted um generally
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's Fallen to the federal government
 
04:54:28.350 --> 04:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
to enforce those rules and the hope is
 
04:54:30.868 --> 04:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
with these two other uh bills being
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
proposed is that New Hampshire law
 
04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement will have uh the recourse
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
one appropriate uh to take enforcement
 
04:54:40.510 --> 04:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
action um based on violations of that
 
04:54:44.350 --> 04:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
potential uh legislation so uh with that
 
04:54:47.070 --> 04:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
just asking that um the language in this
 
04:54:51.510 --> 04:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
current bill um at least be amended or
 
04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
or just for consideration on the
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
committee's part here uh when going
 
04:54:57.750 --> 04:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
forward to maybe have some wording in
 
04:54:59.788 --> 04:54:59.798 align:start position:0%
there that would speak to uh drone
 
04:55:01.510 --> 04:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
operators who would be taking off and
 
04:55:04.430 --> 04:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
flying from state parks uh that they be
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh made aware or at least um somehow
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
written into the bill that they must
 
04:55:12.030 --> 04:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
comply with with state laws as well and
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
I realize I might be getting ahead of
 
04:55:15.150 --> 04:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves a little bit asking you to
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
address potential legislation that's in
 
04:55:20.190 --> 04:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
different parts of uh the legislative
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
process right now but I think it's just
 
04:55:23.470 --> 04:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
important that uh the commit is at least
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
aware of it uh and consider that
 
04:55:27.510 --> 04:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
information uh as they move forward with
 
04:55:29.788 --> 04:55:29.798 align:start position:0%
this bill I'd be happy to take any
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:35.628 --> 04:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
questions pretty easy no questions for
 
04:55:37.310 --> 04:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
the speaker thank you very much I don't
 
04:55:39.270 --> 04:55:39.280 align:start position:0%

HB 644 FN relative to flying drones in
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%

FN thank you representative post and I'm
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to go right into opening the
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on H B 657 FM relative to short
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
notice booking access for New Hampshire
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
residents to state
 
04:56:24.150 --> 04:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
parks see Prime sponsor I believe is
 
04:56:26.110 --> 04:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative Sellers and you're going
 
04:56:28.510 --> 04:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
to present the bill representative thank
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you committee me
 
04:56:32.548 --> 04:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
Members my name is representative John
 
04:56:37.628 --> 04:56:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater I'm going to make this real
 
04:56:39.520 --> 04:56:40.990 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater I'm going to make this real
easy

04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
easy
 
04:56:44.070 --> 04:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you itl this bill
 
04:56:48.190 --> 04:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
because of federal law stepping on us
 
04:56:51.150 --> 04:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
we're not able to really go full with
 
04:56:54.150 --> 04:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
the bill without us stepping all over
 
04:56:57.190 --> 04:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
the state federal law so and and because
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
we actually get Federal money it's a
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
problem and therefore the bill is just
 
04:57:05.350 --> 04:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
mut at this point so if you don't mind I
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you itl the bill thank you
 
04:57:08.430 --> 04:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:57:11.110 --> 04:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative um Mr Wilson do you still

opposed One support blue sheet One

04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
record if our senior minority leader was
 
04:58:01.548 --> 04:58:01.558 align:start position:0%
here I'd probably ask if we could go to

exec and itl this but she's not here and
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%

that'll be an easy one for us next week
 
04:58:11.190 --> 04:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
when we this will be our eighth one for
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%

04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
