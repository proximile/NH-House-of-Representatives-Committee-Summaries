00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
part of the uh original Bill uh there
 
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:33.500 align:start position:0%
was some confusion about
 
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:37.139 align:start position:0%
uh allowing waivers of

um expections on cars so this keeps it
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
so that the inspection date will be in
 
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
May instead of April to help keep away
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
inspection Bill too so questions on
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%

education and looking at it
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%

municipalities to lower the speed limit
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
for just a few months during a season is
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
is is is a good idea however it would
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
apply to every single Road within the
 
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
town and not just specific roads maybe
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
around a lake area or busier it could be
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
any Road in the town so that's why I'm
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%

00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I understand the why uh itl
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
motion was made but it's I was convinced
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
that dot had been making some progress
 
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:19.460 align:start position:0%
about uh authority issue that is
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
happening on many roads that are
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
um that have seasonal traffic issues and
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
while it might potentially open to every
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
single Road in the state I think not all
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
roads have seasonal concerns so and in
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
any event I'll be voting against the Ito
 
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
I'll just offer this I've seen this
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
concept several times now and I remember
 
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
hearing from the Department of
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
Transportation many years ago reminding
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
the committee that 20 miles an hour is
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
painfully slow
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
so you might think this is a good idea
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
to do this in certain areas for certain
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
times but for the majority of the time
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
people are going to get stuck going
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
painfully slow when there's no traffic
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
or whether pedestrians or bicyclists
 
00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:09.059 align:start position:0%
present I know it's seasonal but this
 
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
does not limit it to to Vacation areas
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
this could be done by petition in just
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
about every Town Road in the in the
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
state potentially the patchwork that
 
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
this would could create I just think
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
would be unmanageable so for those
 
00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
Reasons I'm encouraging everybody to
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
vote for the ideal thank you
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%

um basically this bill in testimony
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
seems like more of a housekeeping issue
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
where it clears up a conflict with the
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
federal law and because of that that's
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:11.700 align:start position:0%

uh representative Gorski this is a thing
 
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
that we should be doing there's some
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
important uh principles about when we
 
00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:27.559 align:start position:0%
can get federal law and state law to
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
comport with each other that's a good
 
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.029 align:start position:0%
comport with each other that's a good
thing

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%

anybody else
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
and I know we're all aware of how
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
reluctant we are sometimes creating new
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
study committees with the amount we
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
already have but good news on this bill
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of co-sponsors that are
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
going to be perfect candidates to be
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
sitting on this committee
 
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
um so with nobody else from the
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%

00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
was that representative Hill
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Hill
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
I know you don't want to speak to it
 
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
I'll just mention this uh we this bill
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
was actually introduced last year we did
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
I believe interim study it
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
um what it seeks to do is just verify
 
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
try to verify when people move out of
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
the state just to give some more
 
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.669 align:start position:0%
the state just to give some more
um

00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
it's much knowledge about who is
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
actually here
 
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
come election time basically I guess
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
there's no other way to say it
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I know you'll look at it there
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't seem to be a whole lot
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
of enforcement in it but it does allow
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles to
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
reach out to these people based on the
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
information they have to verify uh their
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
current status so that alone is enough
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
for me to move it forward
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's all I'll say encourage
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
everybody to support the ought to pass
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the committee
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
representative shakes
 
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so I can't support an OTP motion on
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:34.070 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
I just think that it's a unworkable and
 
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
b that it's um
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
trying to attack perhaps a problem but
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
in the wrong way and the my mind the
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill is not ready for prime time and
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be worked on if anything but I
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
can't support it
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
fair enough anybody else from the
 
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.649 align:start position:0%
fair enough anybody else from the
committee

00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative Jones thank you um
 
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
how do we have a definition of residency
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
of established residency
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
some people might live here six months a
 
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.490 align:start position:0%
some people might live here six months a
year

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's your
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
declared domicile when it comes to
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
votings uh
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
in in this what is your declared
 
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:55.909 align:start position:0%
in in this what is your declared
residency

00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
so what would you do you have a
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
statement or did you want looking for an
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
answer to your question
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
it was more of a question you know it
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
was a statement and a question at the
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
same time okay fair enough
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to ask the clerk
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
to call the roll
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh the motion is ought to pass on House
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman Gorski yes
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
yes work votes yes representative Hill
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Dumay Dumas yes
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
representative Melvin yes representative
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
foot yes representative C yes
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative sellers yes
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
no representative Cecilia rich
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
Representative mangaputi no
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Fox
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
no representative Rambo no
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
Representative no representative Coker
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
no representative Jones no
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh Jeffrey rich
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
no representative stop no and chairman
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
Walsh yes
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
so the motion of ought to pass fails
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
are there any of the motions
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
I have a question of the chair yep go
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
ahead so
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
um obviously the next motion
 
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
from my point of view would be uh itl
 
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
um do we need that in order for the bill
 
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
to go to the flow with without
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation or can I just go without
 
00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
recommendation based on the OTP
 
00:32:36.899 --> 00:32:38.990 align:start position:0%
recommendation based on the OTP
fail

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
fail
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm quite certain we need the itl to
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
both to fail for it to go there with no
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
recommendation that being the case Mr
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
chairman I move itl
 
00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:49.549 align:start position:0%
chairman I move itl

00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
all right so what in expedient the
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
legislators been moved by representative
 
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:55.140 align:start position:0%

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion of i.tl fails as well

uh any of the motions
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%

the host floor without recommendation
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%

in expedient to legislate has been moved
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%

you care to speak to emotion sir I do um
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to you know
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
acknowledge representative vayu for
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill up and I can
 
00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:29.690 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill up and I can
understand

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
um why he wants to do that
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
myself I do wear a seat belt and I
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
believe it's my choice and I do that
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
based on the information that I've heard
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
but it's a personal choice and for me I
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
look at this as a personal choice we
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
live in the Live Free or Die State and I
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
believe that you know each individual
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
should make that choice and we should
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
allow a make that choice and because of
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
that that's why I believe we should itl
 
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.030 align:start position:0%
that that's why I believe we should itl
hp222

00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
hp222
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
what a surprise representative
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I understand
 
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
all the arguments
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
um around this bill and I don't take any
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
of them lightly
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
um you know statistically this
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
legislation makes sense that's why every
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
state in the country and 160 out of 180
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
countries around the world have the same
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
law or similar law
 
00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:29.780 align:start position:0%
um it's it's about messaging it's about
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
what we're saying to people
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
when they come into the state or when
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
they drive in the state not having a law
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
puts us in company of such countries
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
around the world is Sri Lanka Bolivia
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan and Burkina Faso
 
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.829 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan and Burkina Faso
um

00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
so the countries that don't have these
 
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.010 align:start position:0%
so the countries that don't have these
laws

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
are countries that don't have a lot of
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
I take this very seriously because
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
statistics back up the efficacy of the
 
00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:05.099 align:start position:0%
law it saves lives and we can find we
 
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
definitely have you know we're other
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
ways to
 
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:11.660 align:start position:0%
exercise our freedoms that
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
this doesn't take it away it's a
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
secondary law so it can't be pulled over
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
for not wearing a seat belt if you're if
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
you think you're a safe driver you can
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
still go ahead and
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.210 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
this is a very difficult vote for me and
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
I I teach safety every day and
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
um I I know the safety issues with seat
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
belts I totally agree with everything
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
that you said and I don't let anybody in
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
my vehicle without a seat belt
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
um you know we I my law enforcement
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
people that come in and speak to my
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
classes always says to the kids you're
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
the captain of your ship so you're in
 
00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
charge when you're driving and you
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
should make sure that everybody in your
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
vehicle wears a seatbelt that's your
 
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
right to do that
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
with all that said I've received phone
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
calls from my constituents in my
 
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.109 align:start position:0%
calls from my constituents in my
district

00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
um who are against being told that they
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
have to wear a seat belt if they don't
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
want to wear a seat belt why should the
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
state or the laws say that they have to
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
and I have to respect that even though I
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
would never ever get into a vehicle
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
without a seat belt on it's really a
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
hard decision for me since I teach it
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
but I will go with my constituents this
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
time and vote itl on the bill I'm sorry
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the committee
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes thank you Mr
 
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.730 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes thank you Mr
chairman

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.010 align:start position:0%
chairman
so

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things that always concerns
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
me about bills that uh have some
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
controversy to them is that we because
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
there is a little bit of controversy or
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
a lot of controversy depending on your
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
perspective we think we we tend to tune
 
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.950 align:start position:0%
perspective we think we we tend to tune
out

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
real statistics that matter that shows
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
that in the case of this seat belt bill
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
that we should pass this bill because it
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
will truly and absolutely save lives
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
that is I don't think
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's an arguable
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
statement on my part
 
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
that said sometimes it's also important
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
for we as representatives to
 
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.430 align:start position:0%
for we as representatives to
um

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to call from for the lack
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
of a better term family history
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to do that right now is it
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
almost as a matter of personal privilege
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
but let me explain
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
I had a I had note that word I had a
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
younger brother
 
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.290 align:start position:0%
younger brother
who

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
when he was 18 decided to hitchhike
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
across the country not exactly the
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
safest thing to do in the world but
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
there it was he was on his way he was
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
getting out of Dodge
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason he got picked up
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
by this guy neither of them had their
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
the car was involved in a crash it
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
rolled over
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
the driver was was thrown out and killed
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
and my brother was stayed in the vehicle
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
but his back was broken and it affected
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
the rest of his life
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
and that that because
 
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
persons who were in the motor vehicle
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
who make that what they see strictly as
 
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
a personal choice choose not to wear a
 
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
seat belt are in fact potentially
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
impacting many many other people's lives
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
and for that reason and many others I I
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
have to support this bill it is the
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
right thing for the people of New
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even if
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
um perhaps there are some constituents
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
who feel otherwise I want us to be the
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die State not to live free
 
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
and die state
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for recognizing me
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's a personal uh thing which I went
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
through with uh my husband being in an
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
accident in November
 
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
seat belt is saved his life and I'm not
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
a widow today so I see personally I've
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
experienced it it was a brand new car
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
and with all that he was hit from the
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
back at 50 miles an hour
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
and seat belt is what saved his life
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
to me that's
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
statistics in the making
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
so it's very tempting that we as
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
legislators Shuffle these pieces of
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
paper and they're gone and the governor
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
signs them and we think something
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
happens I don't have the list with me
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire has a better rate of
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
seat belt use in some states that have
 
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
mandatory seat belt laws I don't know
 
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
if the bill will actually do anything
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
so there's that with the usage go up
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
would it go down my people rebel now
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
that they're being forced to wear it I
 
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to endanger that the value
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
and there's anecdotal stories on both
 
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.210 align:start position:0%
and there's anecdotal stories on both
sides

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
sides
 
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
the uh this isn't my first rodeo with
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
this and I have recounted the story of
 
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
when we were hit by a drunk driver doing
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
100 miles an hour flipped up on our side
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I would not have been able to get my
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
son out of the back seat which was the
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
back of the car was pretty mangled the
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
window was gone the fenders were gone
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
the guy drove right into our trunk we
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
were sitting there hanging on our side
 
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't wearing one at that
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
moment I was able to get in the back and
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
get them out otherwise you would have
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
hung there for the 45 minutes that my
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
wife was trapped in the car
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
so anecdotes are very powerful and they
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
affect us emotionally
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
but they're not statistical
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
in in previous iterations of this bill
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard stories of people that would
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
have been killed had they been strapped
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
right in place as the steering wheel
 
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
came back through them so
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
it's tough to ignore the anecdotes but
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember that they're
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
on both sides and
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
we also don't know if the bill is
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
actually going to do anything at this
 
00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
point so I'll support the itl
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
yes I saw representative Jones first
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.890 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they may sound like a
 
00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
broken record when I say the same thing
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
for different bills but um 2022 deaths
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
by accident rates in New Hampshire were
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
way up
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
and it's not law enforcement who gets to
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
change that it's it's us here who who
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
create policies that can change it with
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
little steps like this
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
that we can do that to make it a safer
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
state so I will not be supporting itl
 
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.450 align:start position:0%
state so I will not be supporting itl
representative

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a clarification we
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
received this information during the the
 
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
last hearing and it shows that New
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of all the United States has
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
the lowest rate of compliance with the
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
seat belts except for Virgin Islands so
 
00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
that's the only other place that that
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
has lower seat belt compliance and they
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
do have a primary seat belt law
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
I don't have that in front of me but I
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
have no reason to dispute you
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
so a couple things coming out to me on
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
this and and I
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
just automatically New Hampshire puts
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
their seat belts on from what I remember
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
from the hearings 75 of the time or a
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
little bit more versus the other states
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
around us are right around 90. so well
 
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
just 15 off think about that way and
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's voluntarily doing it
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
the other part that really comes to me
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
which is more important than anything is
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
one gentleman testified he says this is
 
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:17.780 align:start position:0%
going against my constitutional rights
 
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
and uh first part Article 2 and also the
 
00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
first part article three he says this
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
was actually going against the
 
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
Constitution we all took an O to uphold
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
so therefore you have to itl this
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're going against the
 
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
Constitution and article 3.
 
00:45:43.089 --> 00:45:43.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll just add a couple of a
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
couple of thoughts I couldn't make the
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
public hearing I apologize but I did
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
watch it online and
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
I did hear Captain better say that in
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
his 31 years he's been here
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
promoting reducing crashes
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
and so do I have been on this committee
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
this is my 11th year now and I support
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
things even though a lot of people don't
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
like it to try to reduce crashes because
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
I firmly believe that's how we can see
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
some of our death rates go down there's
 
00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
nothing about a mandatory seat belt that
 
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
is going to reduce crashes some of these
 
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
safety devices whether it's seat belts
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
or helmets they might make it a safer
 
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
crash they may not there's a lot of
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
other arguments of saying that sometimes
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
the seat belts as a distraction can
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
cause crashes so again this is just
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see any evidence that this is
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
going to help anything and just because
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
some of the other states have 90 percent
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
usage according to that study they're
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
not living in New Hampshire I don't know
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
and nobody can it's not proven whether
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
or not even if this was mandatory second
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
secondary or not that we would ever see
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
the 90. it's New Hampshire we are a
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
different store so for those reasons and
 
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
everything else I heard because it's
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
been a great great debate I will be
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl as well anybody else
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
the role when she's ready the motion is
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on House Bill

uh
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
I I expected so okay so our committee
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
recommendation of inexpedia to
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
legislators adopted 11 to nine I've just
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.819 --> 00:49:51.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
open up the executive session on House
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 370 FN relative to aftermarket
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
tinting on Motor Vehicles for drivers
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
with medical conditions chair recognizes
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Crawford for a motion
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I make a motion to
 
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
retain has been moved is there a second
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Coker care to
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
speak to motion
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
I I believe we want to take
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
um 370 and do a little bit of work on it
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're going to retain it
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
we hope that we'll retain it
 
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
fair enough I'll add that we've been
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
talking about tinted windows in
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
different areas of the vehicle for many
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
years now we've made a couple of
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
attempted changes it seems like when we
 
00:50:50.089 --> 00:50:50.099 align:start position:0%
do we confuse another sentence
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
um so I was pretty much agreed at our
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing with not just the
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
committee but with the Department of
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles perhaps we should take
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
these bills retain them and legitimately
 
00:51:01.609 --> 00:51:01.619 align:start position:0%
work on them over the summer so that we
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't keep convoluting the chapter let's
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
try to straighten out the whole thing
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
once and for all uh anybody else from
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
chair yeah one thing I was hearing
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
through the whole committee is we all
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
got confused we didn't know what
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of tinting was automatically
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
placed on the windows we didn't realize
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
there was tinting on the Windows already
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
so to retain it I think is put some
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
clarity to that
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
fair enough we'll go over how this whole
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
process works if this is successful the
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
retain at the end anybody else from the
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
committee representative Smith
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
yeah it's super frustrating that this
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
was going on back when I was sharing the
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee and the positions Committee of
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
the committee's position has always been
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear once we got to it that we
 
00:51:50.809 --> 00:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
would allow aftermarket tension at the
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
same level that you could get on a brand
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
new car because Nitza has deemed that
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
safe it's mind-boggling to me that we
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
haven't come up with a statute that
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
reflects that so yeah I agree it's a
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
good case for retain because I think
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
we're together on the position we'll
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:16.619 align:start position:0%

chairman I'm
I

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.549 align:start position:0%
I
um

00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
I'm like like I moved her chain uh House
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 537 event second Mr chairman okay
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
routine's been moved and seconded by
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
and while she's getting caught up I'll
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
speak to it briefly uh this again is uh
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
dealing with windshield tinting
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
um and so for all the reasons we just
 
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned on the last bill is a good
 
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
reason to retain uh I will Echo those
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
the only reason we arguably don't need
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
both of these to retain to work on them
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh the reason I'm just keeping this is
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be cautious this one deals
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
specifically with ceramic coats that are
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
kind of A New Concept I don't know much
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
about them at this point either I just
 
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to risk losing the ability to
 
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
maybe introducing them if they work with
 
00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
an itl so that's why I'm deciding to
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
hopefully retain both of them I hope you
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
can support that anybody else from the
 
00:55:13.319 --> 00:55:15.470 align:start position:0%
can support that anybody else from the
committee

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative Johnson yes thank you Mr
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh the day we heard these there
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
was a lot of crossover between this one
 
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
and 370 and causing more confusion I
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
think we're doing the right thing by
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
retaining and getting it right
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%

a couple of questions I didn't want to

ask a few people on 570
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
so what I'm going to do

I'm going to open up the executive
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%

to recess the executive session on House
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%

11 15.
foreign

01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back being one uh 11 17.
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open up the executive
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 570 relative to
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
real ID compliant New Hampshire driver's
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
licenses chair recognizes representative
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
Coker for a motion
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
I make a motion to retain 570. retain
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
has been moved is there a second
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Hill care to
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh yes Sharon I do
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
um so you know the real ID is a serious
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
ID it gives you access to Federal
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
facilities for travel
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
so on one side of the coin I don't want
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
to deprive people who are legally here
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
to you know I don't want to deprive them
 
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
of this ID but on the other hand I don't
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
want to issue it prematurely without the
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
proper Safeguard so in talking to the
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
DMV there were some issues different
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
phases people go through in the process
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
so I think retaining this bill allows us
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
to explore that a little bit further
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else from the
 
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.490 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else from the
committee

01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
so I think that the this is a reasonable
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
way for us to proceed
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I actually agree with everything that
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative coca had to say that
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
there's questions to be asked answers to
 
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
I'll just add I'm not necessarily a fan
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
of this but I do understand that our
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
ranking member has been working hard and
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
thinks he's close uh there are good
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
points to it uh and nobody will ever
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
state it on Transportation we're not
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
fair I'll give them the opportunity to
 
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
continue to work on it with nothing else
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the role when
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
she's ready motion is retained on House
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%

01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
did pretty well
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
um for the rest of today just so I can
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
close the books on these if I can get
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
all my committee reports both majority
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
and minority we've got plenty of time
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
um be nice for me to be able to submit
 
01:20:36.189 --> 01:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
them all before I leave
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
any questions from anybody on where
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
we're headed next go ahead uh have you
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
looked to see if there's any potential
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
bills in the Senate that might be coming
 
01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
I have not sat down with the chair of
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
Transportation in the Senate yet I plan
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
on scheduling something with her I have
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
not seen anything we typically don't get
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
a lot from the Senate we could see some
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
years with one maybe two maybe three um
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's we don't usually get overburdened
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
so in terms of our workload we've gone
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
through 90 of it without question so I
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
will look into it uh obviously you'll be
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
the first to know once we have crossover
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I get the bills
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
um but I don't have an exact answer for
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
you right now
 
01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
well all right thanks very much again if
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%

01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:46.970 align:start position:0%
