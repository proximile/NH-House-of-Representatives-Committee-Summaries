00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
you well thank you all for joining I
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
apologize that I have not been around
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
and Brian is capable uh
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
um ability capable whatever to to take
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
care of things so you know what I'm
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
today good as you have been the last
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
month so
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
carry on so
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
um I don't see a whole lot of folks in
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
in the audience who are probably looking
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
to testify um I think we're winding down
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
with the uh folks who have concerns um
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
but um obviously if any of you are
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
interested we'll hear hear from you um
 
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.829 align:start position:0%
interested we'll hear hear from you um
the

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
um there's a few issues that we do need
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
to address um uh and we will need at
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
least one Amendment maybe just just
 
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
maybe just one covering all the issues
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
something I was just talking to um uh
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor about uh was the
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
concern raised last week from the
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I I
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
found it a very legitimate concern over
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
equipment that uh is manufactured
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
overseas does not meet um the OSHA uh
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
requirements um expensive equipment and
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
to require someone to immediately and uh
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
abruptly um replace perfectly good
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
equipment um is uh not what we're after
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
um so what we need to do is figure out a
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
way to accommodate the Department of
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental services without opening
 
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
the barn door wide open for anybody who
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
wants an exception to line up and say um
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
me too um so I think there's um my my
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
last words uh to Mr Gardner was um we
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
got to figure this out so we got to
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
figure that out
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
um another issue that we need to address
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
is the effective date um I think uh in
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
earlier um conversations we've concluded
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
that 60 days um is not a a good idea uh
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
we do need to give people more time to
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
get ready for this
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
um that's uh a discussion I'd like to
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
have today to figure out um as we put an
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
amendment together um what the actual
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
effective date ought to be um you know
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
we heard something about five years um
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
that's too long um and uh and again
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that the department is not
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh I think think I said last week the
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
day this becomes effective there's not
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a starting gun go off and um
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
everybody is going to have to be perfect
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
on day one um the department will um
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
operate the way the department operates
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
that they're not a gotcha operation
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
they're a let's figure this out together
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
operation and um uh I think because of
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
that I I I'm not uh overly concerned
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
with um having everything perfect on day
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
one um but 60 days isn't right we got to
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
figure out somewhere between 60 days and
 
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
several years where we land um several
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
um and I do you want to talk about your
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
um thoughts on yeah whatever here yeah
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'll ask U the chairman to
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh weigh in on something that he and I
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
were discussing um prior to the hearing
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
today so um take it away thank you thank
 
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:52.870 align:start position:0%
today so um take it away thank you thank
you

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
Brian um I have had an opportunity to to
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
briefly uh discuss this with the well I
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
probably have I haven't told you all the
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
things that that I've been doing let me
 
00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:02.829 align:start position:0%
things that that I've been doing let me
back

00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
up so knowing I was not going to be
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
around uh a few meetings I did have an
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have relatively long
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
conversation with commissioner
 
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:16.839 align:start position:0%
Maryfield and um about this and about
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
1910 and you know I admit I have not
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
read all of
 
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
1910 and I don't want to I don't ever
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
want to get caught by saying well yeah
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
we passed something but I didn't really
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
read at all so I have a copy here if
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
anyone's really interested and and this
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know who did this but um um Rudy
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
Ogden provided us with a copy of 1910
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it has uh three different colors red
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
blue and green for items it may not be
 
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
applicable things that could be
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
applicable and non-mandatory things and
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm TR to take it upon myself to
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
read as much of this as I can because I
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
really want to be able to answer every
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
question I can if someone says to me in
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
the committee did anyone read this does
 
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
anyone know what you're asking us to do
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
here um but in the in the conversations
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
that uh I had with the
 
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.710 align:start position:0%
that uh I had with the
commissioner

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
um admittedly the department knows that
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
they haven't kept up with some of the
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
safety things as per I think current law
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
as say every two years or something
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
right now uh it was every year and I
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
think that was then changed modified
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
every two years and then you know things
 
00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
happen and and it doesn't get done no
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
harm no fowl um but trying to implement
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
this entire law it would be relatively
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
impossible um to hand a binder this
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
thick I know you I'm I'm old so I
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually you know made a copy I know all
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
you young kids look at things in
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
computers now uh but my brain doesn't
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
work that way from screen to screen and
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
um what are the things that could we
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
break this down into implementing
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
something different each of the next
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
three years I would not be an advocate
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
for implementing anything as you said in
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
30 or 60 or 90 days nor would I say
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass this and nothing
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
happens for five years because you know
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen all of us know
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
that six months before the fifth year
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
whatever day day we do everyone's going
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
to um six days exactly everyone's going
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
to do it the last week and then say they
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
can't do it uh another thing that dawned
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
on me and I did not to speak with this
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
with Ken uh with the the commissioner
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I've expressed it to
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
anyone here um I don't think it's a bad
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
idea but I'm not sure everyone's going
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
to like
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
it I don't like when we mandate and
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
there have been some discussion about is
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
this a an unfunded
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
mandate to municipalities or to the
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
Departments within our state we do know
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
that there's a surplus every year that
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor um turns back to
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
and in my mind I thought well what's
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
wrong with implementing as part of this
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
law a 5050
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
Grant um up to a maximum allotted amount
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
of 500,000 per
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
year that could be utilized as an
 
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.910 align:start position:0%
year that could be utilized as an
application

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
basis to the Department of Labor to help
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
possibly mitigate some of the cost to
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
the municipalities in the state
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
um Departments of the state to purchase
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
new things that they need to uh there's
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
certain Machinery certain equipment um
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
so I'm throwing that out as an idea to
 
00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:41.470 align:start position:0%
so I'm throwing that out as an idea to
be

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
considered I do not want an
 
00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:46.759 align:start position:0%
implementation of a long period down the
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
road I would like something where 1910
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
could be implemented in sections each
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
year for the next three years um as a a
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
way of easing in some of these things to
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
have it um done with obvious exclusions
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
for certain things U you know one of the
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
the things that um this these machines
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
have you know I don't know how
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
sophisticated these things are but if
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
any of you have ever worked in a machine
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
shop you ever see one of these things
 
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:18.519 align:start position:0%
where you have to have one hand here one
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
hand here and you push it with your foot
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
that way you can't get your hands caught
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
in it I don't know if it's that kind of
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
a machine where that's doesn't have
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
those safety mechanisms or not um I
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have any details on
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
that but uh I wouldn't you know I
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want if it was in the forensic
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
laboratory of the state I wouldn't want
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we put something in
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
place where they can't do their jobs
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
anymore because we're going to hear
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
it so overall that was my thought now
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
how do we do this
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
um we would have to work directly Page
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
by page with the
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
Department to determine which things can
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
be implemented
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh the E you know the ones that are
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
the least costly and most easily
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
implemented the first year and get
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
increasingly more difficult to achieve
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
time is that something the department
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
can I I know you're just just hearing it
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
now um but um can you um share any
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts you might have um on that idea
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
of a uh graduated implementation uh
 
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
whether that makes it
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh easier for folks or more difficult
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
would it be better just to go with the
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
uh concept of um we're going to help you
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
get caught up as um as this
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
implementation happens or is splitting
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
up the uh standards into three uh
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
sections is that something that is
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.950 align:start position:0%
 
workable

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
throw you right into the fire
 
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
here so I think one of the potential
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
concerns without um you know digging
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
really into the 1910s is if there's any
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
sort of references throughout um you
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
know the other portions of 1910 other
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
portions of the OSHA law so um again
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
without digging in it's kind of tough to
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
say but I think that'd be one of the
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
concerns is how do we actually set this
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
up so there isn't any confusion there of
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay this has a reference to subpart s
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
in this one that we've implemented but
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
we have an implemented subpart at
 
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.270 align:start position:0%
we have an implemented subpart at
actually

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
work um what are the employers actually
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
subject to so I think off the top of my
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
head that would be one of the primary
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
concerns which is something that
 
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
obviously we would have to figure out of
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of that um because again
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
I do know that there are references
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the oosha laws to other sub
 
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
parts to other um you know sections of
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
the law in general it it occurs to me as
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
well that um what this bill does is it
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
repeals the Department of Labor safety
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
standards um and implements the OSHA
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
1910 if you repeal the sa the the
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
standards and only uh Implement onethird
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the OSHA standards um the gaps that
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
exist now get a lot bigger um because
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to have entire sections
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
that aren't have have no safety
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
standards yes and to that point there
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
may inevitably be holes um as you're
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
stating that uh you know all the safy
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
standards are repealed and if we are not
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
wholesale adopting 1910 if we're doing
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
it peac meal there might be sections
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
that you know if we don't do scaffolding
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
during the first Go Round And The
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
scaffolding portion is repealed there
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
may be no standards of scaffolding which
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
I think kind of goes against the intent
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
of the bill to make make more robust
 
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
standards why would you want to pass a
 
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.070 align:start position:0%
standards why would you want to pass a
law

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
that wipes out what's being done now
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
because it's being replaced there are
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
scaffolding standards in OSHA there are
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
scaffolding standards in the um
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um safety standards
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
but unless you this then this may make
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
it overly complicated you you would have
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
you you would have to do a partial um
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
repeal and a partial implementation
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
matching up the parts that you're
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
repealing and the parts that you're
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
implementing um over that three-year
 
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.950 align:start position:0%
implementing um over that three-year
period

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
um is it just me or does that make it
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
overly complicated for the Department it
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
has the potential too I I think again
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
the the real key piece there is how they
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
interact with each other um so you know
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
each implementation would require some
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
fairly in-depth analysis I would imagine
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
as to determining again how they're
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
going to interact with each other what
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
the employers are actually going to be
 
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
subject to and again I'd understand the
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill at least one of the
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
intents of the initial bill was to kind
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
of clean things up and you know put it
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
more out there so the employers are
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on so I know that
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
the last thing any of us wants to do is
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
make it more confusing for employers as
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
to what their requirements are under the
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:37.590 align:start position:0%
to what their requirements are under the
law

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's coming back to
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
my mind um in this conversation and it's
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
something that I don't think I did
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
Justice and trying to explain to our
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
chairman when I was talking with them uh
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
can we go back and revisit the
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had last week
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the training um and the idea
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
of training some of the con concerns
 
00:21:57.789 --> 00:21:57.799 align:start position:0%
that were were brought here last week
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
had to do with the additional costs
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
needed for training um and if we even do
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
this in segments you know there is going
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
to have to be a training you know I see
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
I foresee some training and you were
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the idea that some of the
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
um Tradesmen who are licensed um could
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
potentially be the trainers of the oia
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
standards am I understanding that
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
correctly I trying so yeah I I think if
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
I recall correctly what um the concerns
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
from some of the stakeholders were borne
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
out of was the fact that the training
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
requirements under OSHA might be a
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
little bit more stringent um and what
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
the discussion centered on and if I
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
remember correctly what I and it might
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
not have been eloquently testified to
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
and I do apologize if that's true um was
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
that Tradesmen may be um qualified to
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
train that's not a prima fascia case
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
that 100% say it's a plumbing um you
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
know Plumbing that they're training in
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
that if they hold a master plumbers
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
license it's still a case-by casee basis
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
um but I know that the concerns again
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
did Center on we might have to um
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
Outsource some more training which will
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
be cost you know to the
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities and they weren't entirely
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
sure what that training would look like
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
or who would be considered qualified
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
because while there is a qualified
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
person standard it is rather broad under
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
OSHA and to be honest with you I'm not
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
entirely sure how OSHA interprets that
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
um but but again the as far as
 
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559 align:start position:0%
tradesman's go it would be one of the
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
piece of analysis and it would be a
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
case-by casee basis on if they are
 
00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:33.350 align:start position:0%
case-by casee basis on if they are
deemed

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
deemed
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
qualified um and uh pardon me but is
 
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
there more to the question kind of you
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
know um I I might have misunderstood
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with this no but there
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
isn't I appreciate the qualific the the
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
qualifying on that because last week you
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
did leave me um a little bit distressed
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
over the idea having been a professional
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
in the trades um knowing that just
 
00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
because somebody is licensed in the
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
trades does not mean that they are
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
qualified to teach OSHA of course yeah
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if that was I walked
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
away with that saying if I gave that to
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
five of my service technicians you know
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
maybe one of them could come out getting
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
some of it right but the other four
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
would not of course of course you know
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
when I was um licensed as an attorney
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
day one that doesn't mean I'm qualified
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
to train as an attorney so so you you
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
left me with that one hang the world
 
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
possibly think a licensed gasfitter
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
could uh be
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
it would be a piece of the analysis but
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
again it's not necessarily that okay
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
they have this license that's all we
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
need we would still have to vet that and
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
see you know if they do meet the
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
qualified person standard I think one of
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
the obvious pieces is that um you could
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
be one heck of an electrician a really
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
good electrician totally incapable of
 
00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
exactly go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
um during our talks with um Deputy
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Ogden and uh we have a new
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
gentleman here with us um today um if
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
there was no standard
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the do log um there was always
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
reference to a general duties
 
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
clause and where would you reference
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
that back to do you use the
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
OSHA no 1910 what what do you because
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of talk about going to
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
General duties and then looking for an
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
industry standard then going to looking
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
for OSHA I there's a misunderstanding
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
there so when it comes to um the general
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
duties can be found under RSA 281
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
a64 where it just basically says all
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
employers private or public have the
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide safe a safe
 
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.190 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide safe a safe
working

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
environment and they lists a bunch of
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
things that they should be considering
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
and doing like providing P PPE where
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
necessary um then so we would go in
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
under current standards we would go in
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
and do a safety inspection with our
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
safety inspectors and if there's not
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
something specifically enumerated uh
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
within the 1400 lab rules but we
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
identify a dangerous condition so um
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
there's a sinkhole in the middle of
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
their parking lot that doesn't have
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
guarding around it um I think that might
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
even be that's already in there um well
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a sinkhole so it's not doesn't
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
fall under um a confined space um but
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
they they need to address it we'll look
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
at it under
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
277 uh think 17 and 18 so those give us
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction over on a public uh
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
employer for an additional Safeguard or
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
a modification to an already existing
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
safety program or
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
plan now when we look at that most of
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
the time it is not oia standards that
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it's usually some sort
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
of Common Sense thing that had been
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
overlooked you know you see a sinkhole
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
you need to address it uh if there's a
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
suspicion of mold growing you need to
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
test it to figure out whether or not
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's mold before you address it uh
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
because you can be addressing something
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
incorrectly or
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily um and so those are things
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
that not typically under OSHA it's more
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
of a common sense assessment of you know
 
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
how to adopt you know safety standard um
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
like for example um we had one in which
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
there was a loader um that we were invol
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
investigating a serious py injury where
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
it was reversing and it hit and rolled
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
over the foot of the um spotter who's
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
doing the directionals and when we
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
actually did the investigation what we
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
found out was there was a training Gap
 
00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
he did the directional s single for uh
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
reverse when he meant stop when he was
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
doing hand signals um and you know this
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
had been something that had been going
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
on for a while uh between the man
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
supervisor and the employee where they
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
just weren't communicating well between
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
the two of them wanted recognized a
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
training Gap but it hadn't been
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
addressed so when we identified that we
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
added a an additional mod safety
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
standard of you need to complete a
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
training with this individual uh with
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
respect to proper hand signals for
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
directionals uh before he conducts this
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
be um activity again in the future um
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
and then is this addressed in your
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
safety program with respect to training
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
when should he have gotten this training
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
what did the training look like uh and
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know if he wasn't adhering to it
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
what are your steps to include
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
potentially discipline um so those are
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
things that are typically under this the
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
modification St and these additional
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
safeguards um now if it's something
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's completely outside we've never
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
seen before again rarely happens we may
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
look to OSHA for guidance but that does
 
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
often yep um so who sets the training
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
standards where would you look for that
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
the state if the state didn't have
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
something in that area where would you
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
look to find those training standards in
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
order to pass on to the uh municipality
 
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
that you would be investigating so the
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
training center so there are you know
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
Common usely used directional signals
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
for that we we would talk to the to the
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
employer and say you know how do you
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
what are your directionals how do you do
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
train for them and so it's the employer
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
who would be stating and this isn't in
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
OSHA either um but it would be something
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
in which the employer would State you
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
know we adopted these directionals These
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
are the signals that we utilize and
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're like okay how are you
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
communicating that to your employee how
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
are you training and then how are you
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
supervising to make sure they're
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
actually adhering it to it so that
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
everyone's on the same page and these
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
again good is it follow that's okay yep
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
on so but there needs to be some type of
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
goto when the state does not have an
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
industry an industry standard or a
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
standard within the do what is to say
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
that we cannot do the easy stuff first
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
without having a law to mandate you guys
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
to bring your standards up into at least
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
the 2000s or you know 2010 standards or
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
something like that into current
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
standards because we have building codes
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
that are current we have electrical
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
codes that are current we have food
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
safety codes that are current why do we
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
not have workers safety codes that are
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
current and ocean standards may not be
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
the you know is top tier why are we not
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
even approaching mid tier when it comes
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
to some of the safety
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
standards well I'm not saying we weren't
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
approaching top or mid tier it's you
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
know these are in instances in which
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
would not have addressed been addressed
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
by OSHA either proper training you know
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
I guess you know OSHA would say you have
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
to utilize proper training there's
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
something in there too but our standards
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
say the same thing so I don't think I
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
follow so the easy ones some of the easy
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
ones like not using an metal ladder when
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
you're working on electricity I mean
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
some of that stuff is common sense OSHA
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
says you have to use a certain type of
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
ladder certain type of foot SES um
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
certain type of equipment insulated
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
equipment when you're working on
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
electrical live electrical lines if our
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
standards current standards right now do
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
not address that and somebody is injured
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
during working on one of the Bridge
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
Project or lighting project where would
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
the state the inspector go to find those
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
standards to say this is what you should
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
be doing which is the correct U
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
procedures even though we don't have
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
those particular you know stringent
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
standards we can at least get you part
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
way to being more safe for your
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
employees it would just be the
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
additional safeguards in the sense that
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be operating you know
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
around electricity without utilizing
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
proper safety gear to include not a
 
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.830 align:start position:0%
proper safety gear to include not a
metal

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
metal
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
ladder but where would you find those
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
standards where would you where would
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
you go to if the state doesn't have
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
1400 have something somewhere on that
 
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:21.590 align:start position:0%
1400 have something somewhere on that
already

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
so you know utili OSHA could be a
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
standard that we utilize but we also
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
look at the actual you have to operate
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
all equipment as it is designed to be
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
operated and a lot of the equipment
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
would say do not operate around live
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
wires so that would also be where we
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's one of the standards that we have
 
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
in our laws that operate equipment as
 
00:32:41.639 --> 00:32:46.269 align:start position:0%
in our laws that operate equipment as
it's

00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
directed I I I guess what we're what
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is the reason why
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
we're doing this um we are trying to
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
expand and provide more complete uh
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
safety standards
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
um the difficulty is that we and and
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
we'll and OSHA included does not have
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
everything no standard will U provide
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
for every safety issue Under the Sun um
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know you're talking about sink holes
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
sinkholes are a problem but does any
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
safety Standard address sink holes
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
probably not um so uh the general duties
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
Clause is going to continue to be
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
necessary so that Common Sense safety
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
can be observed
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
um but that doesn't mean this uh effort
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
is not needed we we do need um more
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
complete safety standards and um this
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
bill provides for that so um I guess
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
that's why we're doing this and that's
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
not the position of the department we
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
take no position with respect to the you
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
know any laws that you draft uh or and
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
adopt I just wanted state that we do
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
issues I
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm I'm I'm thinking that
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
um some issues that we need to address
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
and I I'm wondering if we ought to be
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
addressing them offline to some degree
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
um the um we need to figure out the dees
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
exception issue um we need to figure out
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
whether graduated implementation is
 
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.869 align:start position:0%
whether graduated implementation is
feasible

00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:27.430 align:start position:0%
feasible
um

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.550 align:start position:0%
um
inadvisable

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
inadvisable
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
um because I can see the potential for
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
it be becoming more complicated and more
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
confusing and people don't know we have
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
bigger gaps in our safety standards and
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
no one knows exactly what standards
 
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
we're using because part part of it's in
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
part of it's not um so um we need to
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
figure that out and um I think we need
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
to have some um uh probably some
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
in-depth conversations with the um
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
department on the uh the cost sharing uh
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
concept I suspect that might be a um uh
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
something that kind of goes to the top
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
um you you guys aren't authorized to
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
spend money are you
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
no it goes to the top house yes you're
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I entertain thoughts from
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
the rest of the U committee here as as
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
to um how we might uh do that I I one
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
possibility is that the uh uh
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
representative in infantine myself could
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
meet with the Department to try to work
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
these things out um aside from uh an
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
actual hearing um you know it would be
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
you know just the two of us trying to
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
come up with something that we would
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
then bring bring back to the
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and eventually um before
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
too long we need to vote this uh this
 
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
bill out of the subcommittee and send it
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
onto a um executive session um but um I
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
think we've uh thrown some some things
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
up in the air that need to be resolved
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
before we can do that um do you have
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
that overall my thoughts are that we
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
currently have a law which requires the
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor to update their
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
safety standards on on a whatever
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
regular basis that is um for reasons
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
that that you know things happen it
 
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done I am not going to be
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
critical of the Department of Labor
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
because overall I think they do an
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
extremely good job here in the state of
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but the fact is I don't
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
want to put a law in place that is so
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
voluminous that they're not adhering to
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
the law now and then we put something
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
you know so big in that it's still not
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
going to be I mean I I just I would
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
really like to know some of the details
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden the legislature passes
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
1910 as is what is the Department of
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
Labor going to do how many employees
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
they have to hire who's going to be in
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
charge of this who's going to know this
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
thing left and right how much is going
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
to be implemented what about the
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
training that's going to have to be done
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
by the do to allow uh members of their
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
own Department to come in and do these
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
things and and I'd rather have a much
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
more neat neat plan um more con clear
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
and concise plan um so we know exactly
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
what it is now you know
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
Department's you know very good you know
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
they their standard answer like many of
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
the other departments are we will do
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
what the law requires us to do
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know they're not legislators and
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
we're not administrators um but I just
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we are not in a
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
situation where we Implement something
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
where the Department's not prepared to
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
enforce and we're having
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and Departments of the
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
state having to spend a bunch of money
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
to get up to a certain standard when no
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
one at the Department of Labor really
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
knows that standard yet because
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
someone's got to spend six months
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
studying it and figuring it out um it
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
just doesn't happen overnight where we
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
pass something and they know this
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
correct I mean no one's going to
 
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
memorize this
 
00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.270 align:start position:0%
memorize this
overnight

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
um so I want to make sure what we're
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
putting in place is actually going to be
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
adhered to and
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
and rolled out
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
correctly and we get up to a better
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
standard where we are today now that
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
sounds good I don't know how to do that
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
Brian that's yeah that's not our job
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
that's your job and so I guess I would
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
be delighted to hear some thoughts from
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
to what you what the department would
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
need to do or put in place in order for
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
this uh implementation and when when you
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
know the time frame I your uh input on
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
the effective date would be helpful as
 
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.710 align:start position:0%
the effective date would be helpful as
well

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
and and a fair answer would be we're not
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
sure we have to figure that out um and
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know I my objective is not to put
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
you on the spot and say um we we want an
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
answer now to every question um but do
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts on a I think what
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
the chairman is is indicating is is is
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
fair that basically we want a clean
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
implementation um what does the
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
department need in order to provide a
 
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.190 align:start position:0%
department need in order to provide a
clean

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
implementation um so initially I would
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
say of course you know we would need
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
time as well um to your point
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure what the
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
time frame really would be at the end of
 
00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
the day but our current safety
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
inspectors are trained on our safety
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
laws and they're trained on how to
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
research other safety laws but they are
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
not trained on OSHA so obviously any of
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
our safety inspectors any of our
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
administrative staff that handles this
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
stuff would have to you know spend some
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
time learning the OSHA laws training on
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
those um to be honest with you I'm not
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
entirely sure what that looks like um as
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
we talked about previously I think that
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
we would at a minimum you know even if
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing peace meal implementation we
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
would need some more um more staff um
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
one of the big pieces would be the
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
consultation program that is required by
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
an oosha state plan I know obviously
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
we've talked about we're not going to an
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
oosha state plan but inevitably we would
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
expect to see a lot of the stakeholders
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
be proactive and reach out saying hey I
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
know that this is coming we want to make
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we're good um which obviously
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
we all want that so again our safety
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
inspectors already have their own case
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
load as is this would add to that and it
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
would you know again add to the
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
consultancy piece in the sense that we
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
would expect um some sort of a Floodgate
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
to open where these stakeholders would
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
be seeking some input from us they would
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
be seeking much like we're doing with
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
currently of going out there determining
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
where they're stand where they're at
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the current standards where
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to be at relative to the
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
new standards and what that would take
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
so um you know in short as you did state
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative a lot of this is
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
difficult to determine on the spot right
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
now it's something of course we can work
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
towards you know determining with our
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and Deputy Commissioner and
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
our safety inspectors um but to the
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
question relative to time frame the
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
department itself would need some time
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
as far as implementation goes of course
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
as we've heard from the stakeholders and
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
everyone's aware they would need some
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
time for implementation as well and and
 
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
I guess what we're asking not at the
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
moment but we need to know what that
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
time frame is
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and I think we need to
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
um ask for the Department to develop a
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
plan for implementation that uh we can
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that this bill is uh uh
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
properly amended so that uh the
 
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
department can't provide for that clean
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
implementation that I was talking about
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
um and um I guess my question is how
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
soon can we have that uh from you
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
because we we we need to move forward
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
with this uh we retained it so we could
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
do this so um uh and I I I for one would
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
be happy to come in and meet with uh
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
um members of the department um to to
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
work on it and um I know my uh friend is
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh pretty busy but uh would you be
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
think that might be a good good way to
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
go forward uh short term but I but we
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't have months to get this done we
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
have days
 
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
um what what would be a good plan for us
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
folks even if it's just excuse me even
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
if it's just a
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm not expecting book chapter and
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
verse but even um an outline y bullet
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
pointed outline uh you guys can work on
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
the details yourself giving us a time
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
because it'll give us the time frame
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
which you need to determine some kind of
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
implementation U because you know as
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
simple as okay this thing gets passed
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
let's say it gets signed by the governor
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
in June of of
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
2024 it's going to take two or three
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
months for the Department to budget
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
determine uh who what additional staff
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
they need get them hired get them on
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
board get them trained before you can
 
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
then start having educational things so
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
kind of that that is more of a timeline
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for it doesn't have to
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
be exact to the date um more more
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
General bullet points and and
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
subsections than a complete written
 
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:40.559 align:start position:0%
Epistle of of
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh that you probably have to send over
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know possibly the Jael car or
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
something so I think that's something
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
obviously the department can work on and
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
get that to you as soon as we can um and
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
of course we're more than welcome to
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
anyone any of the representatives coming
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
in to work with us on it have any
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns obviously we're
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
always available um I would say one
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
piece of that
 
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
being the timeline would inevitably be
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
different and we can work on both
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
timelines and an estimate to that but
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
obviously as you know the concern being
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
might take longer um what I'm getting at
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
is whether we're doing peace meal as
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
we've you know potentially discussed if
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
we're doing the wholesale adoption uh so
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
you the long and short being the
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of what we're actually doing
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
here would of course impact what it
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
would take for us to implement it and
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
again we can work on um varying kind of
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
proposals and again of course they'd be
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
broad um but again inevitably that would
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
take more time because we'd have to do
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
there you had mentioned briefly in your
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that your inspectors are
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
trained under your either General duties
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
or or other mechanisms and not OSHA
 
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.829 align:start position:0%
or or other mechanisms and not OSHA
right

00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
um and and part of the I don't know who
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
the I don't know I don't know what I'm
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
trying to say here part of what was done
 
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
with 1910 was someone made a decision to
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
look through every single line and
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
determine what you're doing what you're
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
not doing what may not be applicable
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
correct so my point is I'm trying to
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
make is how different are they do you
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
have any I mean just so I I I can tell
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
you I was the one actually did that um
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's been several years at this point
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
but as you probably note um even just
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
kind of going through it broadly but
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
once you're going through it a little
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
bit more with a fine tooth comb a lot of
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
the provisions we simply have nothing um
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
so it's completely absent from our laws
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
again these are pieces that um as
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
director roas has testified to that our
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
inspectors are trained to recognize of
 
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
like an obvious safety issue um so you
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
know it in something that they might go
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
to OSHA they might go to just the
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
general standards of the equipment
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be but for them to be
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
experts to be going out to these
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
locations um you know of course they
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
don't need to know word by word
 
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
everything but they need to have a
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
general sense to say okay I know that
 
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standard that we're using now
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
under the 1910s actually delineates
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
specific you know inches or feet or you
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
know whatever it may be for say the um
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
the space between rungs on ladders that
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
might be something we don't have so it's
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
something that they would need to be
 
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
trained on again not to the minutia by
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
any means but to be able to recognize
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
that that it's like okay this on its
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
face looks like it might not comply I
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at this standard I
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
need to measure this um so that's where
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
um you know to your overall point the
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
the issue being that a lot of these
 
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
pieces are completely absent from our
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
laws it's not merely in a lot of cases
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
of we're adding more safeguards more
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
standards to something that's already
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
there obviously you know scaffolding is
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
something that we have in our rules and
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
our law that would be a little bit more
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
robust so it's something that they're
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
already trained on at least to a point
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
so it would be an addition to that but
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
again a lot of this stuff will be under
 
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.790 align:start position:0%
again a lot of this stuff will be under
the

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
1910s um items that are completely new
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
to our
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
laws do do you I just wanted to address
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not just general duties it's
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
chapter lab 277 277a
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh lab rule 600 and the 1400 so it's our
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
inspectors are well-versed in a number
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
of statutes I just wanted to make sure
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
that they weren't getting short shifted
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
and that they know of one statute they
 
00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
you know they're pretty knowledgeable
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
and they it does provide a level of
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
protection but I just wanted to clarify
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah my my impress I we are I'm
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
aware I think we are aware that uh
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
there's more than just the general
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
duties Clause um everything doesn't come
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
under that but but I would say too much
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
much stuff does come under that um and
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
um my observation and see if this is uh
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
if you agree um the
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh where the uh there is a uh Department
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
of Labor Standard and an oia standard uh
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't generally conflict
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
with each other um they might look um
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
different they might be worded
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
differently and in many cases the OSHA
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
standard is more is more robust more uh
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
detailed um but as I read through and
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
and did um comparisons of you know the
 
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
two um I didn't see conflicts and I
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
don't think there's going to be
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
something that uh would be deemed safe
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
under the uh department of labor
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
standards um and suddenly unsafe under
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards that's the exception
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
being will we just identified with the
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
um Environmental Services yes yes didn't
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
hear you I'm sorry the exception is the
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services concern that
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
we'll be addressing right yes yes the
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
equipment that U is
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh um made made made overseas and
 
00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.829 align:start position:0%
uh um made made made overseas and
therefore

00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
not uh not not working for us so but
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's something we need to figure out
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
um do you have an idea um
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
when uh would be good for uh
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative infantine and myself to
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh come meet with the
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
Department I mean you need some time to
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
to I'd say both director roas and myself
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
can make ourselves available generally
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
whenever works for um the both of you we
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
would have to speak to you know
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner Maryfield and W
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner Albert as I would imagine
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
that they would want to be involved as
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
well too um but of course you know they
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
generally obviously they're busy but
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
they do try to be available as well um
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
so to the question off the top of our
 
00:49:54.789 --> 00:49:54.799 align:start position:0%
head there's no specific dates or times
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
that we could propose at this time but
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
it's something that I think we can put
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
together in very short order that works
 
00:49:59.799 --> 00:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
together in very short order that works
for

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
everybody how how about uh you go back
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
to the department and um let us know
 
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
when would be a good time and I think I
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
just heard you say Deputy Commissioner
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
Albert yes she has ascended to the
 
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
deputy commissionership
 
00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.990 align:start position:0%
deputy commissionership
well

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
deserved um and I for anybody who
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't know um Deputy Commissioner
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
Ogden is now in the governor's office
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
and gone from the Department of Labor so
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
um he will be missed
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
um ahead thank you Mr chairman um it
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like you want to have an advisory
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
committee for implementation of the
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
ooser standards could that be part of
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
this bill going forward could be and
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
also um could
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
the could we have a permanent
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or if in addition to or
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
in in you know in if you don't do the
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
advisory committee could we have a
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
permanent subcommittee so we can have um
 
00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
um quarterly meetings or quarterly
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
updates on what is being done um after
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
law certainly
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
possible and one final update would you
 
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.670 align:start position:0%
possible and one final update would you
mind

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
um looking through some of this and
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
we've looked through it for years now
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and I want to thank um this
 
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
gentleman here for working on that um if
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
there wasn't implementation over time
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
could the easy stuff be done first and
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
then the medium stuff A year later and
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
then the hard stuff be worked on through
 
00:51:34.349 --> 00:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
the entire things that have the the you
 
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
know the tentacles that go out into
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
other Industries to handle um that like
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
not using an aluminum ladder at
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
electrical if it's not in our standards
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
easy stuff that we could I think again
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
the the potential difficulty um without
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know delving into the minutia of the
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
1910s is where there's cross references
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
pieces like that I would say say the the
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
other piece which is I guess would be
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
for all of us to determine like what
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
constitutes the easy ones what
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
constitutes which which I think would go
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
back to cost at the end of the day more
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
than likely in implementation um but
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps that probably requires a little
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
bit more input from the stakeholders um
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know because again the until you
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
know the good example is the
 
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services until they
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
brought that up it's not something that
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
I think the department nor the committee
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
knew would be um such a large project
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
and a large cost to
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
Implement um so to your question I mean
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
I I think it's definitely possible um on
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
its face but you know that that's that
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
answer could change in the future the
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
more that we actually look into what the
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
mechanisms and procedure of that would
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
really be at the end of the day um but
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
you know I think if it can work it could
 
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
be a good idea in the sense that uh it
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
allows to kind of Peace meal and slow
 
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
walk this thing while updating the
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
standards um and again that's something
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
that will take the time to look into as
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
much as we can you know given our time
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
constraints of what that actually might
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
entail on our end and again the the the
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
other caveat
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
being it might be difficult if we're
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
identifying what's you know
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
easy difficult you know and we're kind
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
of uh you know figuring out what's that
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
are those actually you know contained
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
within is is if we say subpart d is that
 
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
is of subpart D easy or are there pieces
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
of that that 90% of it is very easy
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
implementation but there's the 10%
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause this large cost to
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
Dees I'm not sure about that so that's
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to say on its face again so
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's another concern and consideration I
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
think we would all have to have and at
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the day I think we all want
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
this to be as streamlined and simplified
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
for everybody um and I would worry and
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
have concerns if we are adopting
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
portions of
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
subparts piece meal um how difficult
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
that might be then to implement and
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
understand by the stakeholders but again
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that we'd have to work
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
through and uh look into a little bit
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
more in depth I would
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
say y so even just even just identifying
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
what PPE is if I can go to 277 and look
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
and see okay what PPP PPE requires a
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
mask of a certain standard or gloves of
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
a certain standard or your hand gloves
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
for you know identifying something needs
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
to be a certain Mill per I mean that
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff is not in there and I know
 
00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
it's probably in 1910 could we slow walk
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
that to saying okay well these are you
 
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
have to have gloves but this is the
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
standard that we would be looking for
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
now or this is the standard that we
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
would be looking for in three years or
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is the changes that we need to
 
00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:45.559 align:start position:0%
implement to make sure that it happens
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
or instead of a three-point harness you
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
now need a fourpoint harness to hang off
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
a bridge or something like that I mean
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
stuff would be easy for for somebody
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
like me that reads it of course and then
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
you know you guys have the you again I I
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's definitely possible and
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
again the the the concern that I think
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
that we would have is just in the sense
 
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
of if we're taking peace meal from each
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
part of this you know if we're just
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
taking full subp Parts it's relatively
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
easy I would say of now we're doing subp
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
Parts D through F and now we're doing G
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
through J whatever it may be but once we
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
start taking okay now we're
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
doing these Provisions from subpart C
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
but we're holding off on these other
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
Provisions from subpart C it could just
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
become more of a project um not that you
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
know we're you know afraid of hard work
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
by any means but again I think that one
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
of the intents of this bill was to get
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
the standards one get them more robust
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
but get them more out there and I think
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
that was kind of your line of
 
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
questioning earlier of we want these
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to actually know what these
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
standards are and what the Department's
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
going to be going towards um so again it
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
just might be a little bit more
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
difficult and again this is just me kind
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
of spi Balling on it you know I'm not
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
without actually delving into it but if
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
we are taking peace meal from each subp
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
part the further we delve down the kind
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
of more difficult it does get a little
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
bit in the sense that okay now we have
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
to remember in four months we have to go
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
back to subpart C and re-evaluate these
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
are the pieces we're missing from
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
subpart C that we haven't implemented
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
yet are these uh easy that we want to
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
implement now are they a little bit more
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
difficult um so that that's the only
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
concern that would have in that sense if
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and and I I guess the
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
the other concern that I continue to
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
have is that when this bills uh signed
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
into law when it becomes effective um
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
all of the um current safety standards
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
go away and we we have to make sure that
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
we don't leave uh a vacuum with no
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
standards um covering vast sections of
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
the uh uh public sector Workforce um and
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if if rather than picking
 
00:56:59.470 --> 00:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
and choosing which standards to
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
implement um perhaps there can be some
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
language added into the uh an amendment
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
that would um impact the implementation
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
process in other
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
words how will the department be viewing
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
um employers who are um new to the OSHA
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
standards um can we put and again you
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to say that we're going to
 
00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
give everybody a pass um because you you
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't do that now um but uh is there
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
something we can do in order to
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
um give
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
employers a grace period of some
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
sort so I can address how we do it
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
currently okay um so right now if we
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
come to a location and they have just
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
passed their budget and they you know
 
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
and they have and that they didn't raise
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
any of the safety concerns that we
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
notifi that we re recognized during our
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
inspection we look at it and we triage
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done immediately uh
 
00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:01.559 align:start position:0%
what are the hurdles and then we babysit
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
the case to make sure it's all done
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
within a reasonable amount of time so
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
for example there was an elevator that
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
needed to be fixed but uh because of the
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
current economy the piece that needed to
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
be made by special order wasn't going to
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
be ready for six months well is the
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
elevator able to be safely maintained or
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
operated until then no okay we're going
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
to suspend that unit um um adopt new
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
safety standards in the meantime do you
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
have an additional elevator yes great um
 
00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
and then you know so that there's and so
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
we just we wait and you know but we're
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
babysitting we don't close that case um
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
there was another instance in which a
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
boiler was being improperly maintained
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
well you know well we had allocated this
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
amount of money for an ice cream uh
 
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
County Ice Cream was was a town I think
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
was going to put a little ice cream
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
stand said well you know does that take
 
00:58:56.029 --> 00:58:56.039 align:start position:0%
precedence over the boiler in which
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
could go boom uh no so they were able to
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
reallocate the funds for the ice cream
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
so nobody got ice cream this past summer
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
sorry uh but they got a new boiler um
 
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
for that location so it's you know so we
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
were able to discuss what needs to be
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
done immediately and then create a
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable timeline for the other things
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
to get done we're not talking years
 
00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:17.799 align:start position:0%
we're talking months um and then it's
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
monitored by an inspector um so this
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
would C you know if if we do have
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
additional you know
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
new standards there's going to be a lot
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
more cases to babysit this is where our
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
staffing needs are going to become
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
stretched then though and and I think
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
that was um part of our discussion in
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
the last couple sessions here that um
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
I've said it over and over again the
 
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
department is not a punitive Department
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's a um uh Department that helps
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
people get um get it together so perhaps
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to suggest this and see where
 
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
it goes but perhaps it's better to just
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
adopt all the standards all at once with
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
the emphasis that um the department will
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
continue operating the way it does um
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
helping people to learn the new
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
standards um and the new adjustments
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
they need to make and um as you said
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
babysit the the issue uh to make sure
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
the people come come along
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
um that way we don't have any gaps in
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
standards no confusion as to which
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
standards are in place and which ones
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
aren't um they're all in place but we're
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
not going to whack you over the head
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
with it um we're going to help you get
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
get in line um I guess I throw that to
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.039 --> 01:00:45.789 align:start position:0%
 
think

01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I really want to go on
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
the record is passing a piece of
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
legislation knowing full well I don't
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
expect the Department of Labor to
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
enforce it the way it's been
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
written you know I but but they're
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
they're simply continuing to operate the
 
01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
way they operate right now if someone's
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
unaware of the current
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
standards um they don't necessarily get
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
uh the book thrown at them true so we
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
are operating as the law is designed the
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
law requires us to be reasonable so you
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
know there is a reasonable standard so
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
there is a you know like there's a
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
shutdown provision if safety standards
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
are not being met such that there is
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
danger of life and limb we are evalu
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's not the first goto there are
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
punitive measures that can be
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
implemented that's not our first goto we
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
don't assess civil penalties you know
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
this is you know the safety unit is not
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
a money generator at all we're not you
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
know so it's something in which we use
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
if we need to escalate but rarely do we
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
have an employer who is doing this
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
intentionally it's we're education
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
forward and we've noticed that most of
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
the viations that we see are just due to
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
ignorance um with you know good
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
intentions but ignorance so we are you
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
know so it's just education figuring out
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
how fast it can be implemented you know
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
for instance if they're missing an eyew
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
watch station that can be done very
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
quickly we don't if they ask for a
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
30-day extension that's a no um but if
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're asking for a piece that needs to
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
be specially made in China uh and you
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
know that's we're going to be reasonable
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
an understanding of when that's going to
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
be accommodated but we're going to make
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
sure that that
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
condition that's currently being uh that
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
exists isn't endangering anyone in the
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
meantime so so I guess the point is that
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
we would not be passing um a law that uh
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
gives the department a pass on not
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
enforcing you will be enforcing but you
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
will enforce the way you enforce now
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
that you you will be helping people to
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
come into compliance um so I I I guess
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
it seems to work better that way than to
 
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.269 align:start position:0%
it seems to work better that way than to
uh

01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
be slow walking the um which standards
 
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
are being uh U implemented when um that
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
seems like an overly complicated process
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
um either way we'd be implementing it
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
right Mr
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
chairman the
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
the the one thing I seem to continue to
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
be confused on here is
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
why the bill has to be
 
01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
written where it removes all of
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
something and implements something
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
else why can't the existing law about
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
General duties 281 277 1718 4600 1400
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
still be in place they're utilizing and
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
then Implement complete sections of
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
certain parts of 1910 like the ladders
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
is one of them you keep mentioning there
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
a whole 25 p pages about ladders and
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
then there's something about um uh
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
chains uh hoisting chains you know about
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
the certain um size they have to
 
01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.589 align:start position:0%
the certain um size they have to
be

01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
so did I miss something or is this just
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
kind of the thought process where you
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
take what's you got now move it aside
 
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
Implement all of
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
1910 why can't you keep what you have
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
Implement certain sections of 1910 in
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
their entirety
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that that would be
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
confusing because essentially employers
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
would have to figure out which sections
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
are are OSHA and which sections are
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
under the um old statute and um it would
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
be very difficult for them to keep track
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
of that um and frankly I asked for some
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
help with the Deputy Commissioner in
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
drafting the bill and it was his thought
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
that um the cleanest thing to do is
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
repeal the whole
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
um all of the do standards and replace
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
them all at once so no one is confused
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
as to what the standard is
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
um so the the thought is that with
 
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
what's being used now and implementing
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
complete sections of
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
1910 that there's con
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh conflict in consistency well I mean
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
as we look through the side by side that
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh um attorney Gardner put together
 
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.390 align:start position:0%
uh um attorney Gardner put together
course

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't want to have um an OSHA
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
piece and a do piece they're similar
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
they probably are not in conflict with
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
each other but they might be in in small
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
ways and again that would be incredibly
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
confusing to say we're going to keep the
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
old standard and the new standard at the
 
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.349 align:start position:0%
old standard and the new standard at the
same

01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
time because um you'd be covering the
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
same um uh standards
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
in two different ways in many instances
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
in many instances as uh attorney Gardner
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
pointed out there is no standard in the
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
in the current do um and I mean frankly
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
filling in those gaps is what we're
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
trying to do and uh getting that done
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later I think is a
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
good thing and having the department
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
helping employers learn and understand
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
where where these new uh standards um
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
are taking place I I
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
think I mean a lot of these
 
01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
standards don't depending on what kind
 
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
of employer you are um a lot of the
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
standards don't mean anything to certain
 
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
employers um they don't I
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
mean in the schools they don't use
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
ladders a lot so the um although the
 
01:06:48.039 --> 01:06:49.069 align:start position:0%
ladders a lot so the um although the
custodians

01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
custodians
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
do um but um but in terms of uh most
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
departments within the school don't have
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
to worry about a lot of these standards
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
um only the the maintenance department
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
so I I just I find the idea of
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
implementing it in pieces to be
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly confusing and um difficult
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example I'm just
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
reading this and again I'm reading some
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
of the stuff for first time in depth do
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh period 142 temporary labor camps
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
there's eight pages on temporary labor
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
camps I'm not sure that's a really
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
important thing to be implemented right
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
now um for our municipalities to have
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
but if it is implemented it won't matter
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
because there are no temporary labor
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
camps um so then I got to read all the
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
other stuff this is what I'm afraid of
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid of someone going out and you
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
know hiring someone said okay 1910 is
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
the law city of Manchester goes out and
 
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
is's going to hire someone at the cost
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
of about all in
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
$125,000 a year okay to study and
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
Implement 1910 and they're going to put
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
you know put rules together for I I
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
don't know ladders labor camps uh uh
 
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
chain uh couplings how they're supposed
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
to be done and all these other things
 
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.829 align:start position:0%
to be done and all these other things
and

01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:18.590 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
then if someone's actually following
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
what we're telling them to do
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
we Implement a
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
law the um the cost associated with some
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
of these things and and
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
um again I'm I'm remiss for not having
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
read these thousand Pages which I guess
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
I'm G to have to start reading but
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
um you
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not trying to dumb it
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
down I I just want to implement things
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
that are are so I you know when I took
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
my OSHA 10 okay the things that I was
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
taught basically or fall safety
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
trenching Hees you know those are the
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
three big ones that seem to cause most
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
of the the injuries and and I want to
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
hit the things that are probably the
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
ones that are most
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
important um and that was the only thing
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
I was trying to do Brian not try to to
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
do anything halfway or to to but
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
implementing some things that
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
um I mean I'm not sure they're going to
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
enforce much on labor camps and ladders
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
and and I I think what each employer
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
will do is they'll go through and
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
they'll say this doesn't apply to us
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply to us this doesn't
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
apply to us these do and they'll focus
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
on the on the pieces that do and ignore
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
the ones that have nothing to do with
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
them um that that'll
 
01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
be you know different for the different
 
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
types of employers and and a lot of uh
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
public sector workers like
 
01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
firefighters theyve got standards above
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
and beyond and aside from um OSHA that
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
they um that they adhere to and
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh so that I mean
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
they I I think the employers and and I
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
don't think it falls on us to memorize
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
the Thousand Pages um I that's not going
 
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
to be my object objective here be being
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
somewhat aware of how they align and
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
again the work of attorney Gardener is
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
very helpful here
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't think this is as
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
difficult as we're making it out to be
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
um there will be a lot of standards that
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
don't apply to any public sector um
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
employers there will be
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
um depending on what kind of employer
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
they are the um they will focus on the
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
standards that are
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
relevant and that's you if if the
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
Consultants that the Department of Labor
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
um U hires
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
um they'll be hiring people that
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
probably have gone through the Keen
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
State program um which um is the
 
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh OSHA training center for um for New
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
but as you know Mr chairman I'm always
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
cognizant about passing a bill out of um
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
the house that we can
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
get signed by by the governor into law
 
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.830 align:start position:0%
get signed by by the governor into law
and

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned that if we pass this
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
and we go to a senate hearing we have
 
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
too many kind
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
of oh maybe balls in the air with with
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
with what we're trying to to tell them
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
that we want them to do well and iess
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's reason and I guess what I'm
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
looking to is let's get the Department
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
of Labor to help us with uh the the
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
details on that um um I don't know if it
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
would help if we met with you before you
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh implement the uh come up with that
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
plan or whether it's
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh in in which case probably early next
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
week would be a good time to get
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
together um and then and maybe what we
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
ought to do is is you know take it uh
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
give it two weeks um talk to you early
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
next week and then um the the following
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
week um have an outline so that when we
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
do go to the Senate I agree we we need
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to say this is how this thing
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
is going to be rolled out but I I I
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
guess I rather than us um trying to um
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
micromanage this I don't think that is
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
our role um that's your role um we're
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to micromanage it and
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
and figure out the cleanest way to um
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
roll this thing out um what is the best
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
effective date um if there's any reason
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
to have multiple effective dates um
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
where certain aspects of this are are
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
done um we'd like to hear about that um
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do about the dees
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh concerns
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we need to have a discussion
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
with the uh commissioner about the um
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
Prospect of a 50-50 cost sharing for um
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
um for employers and um
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
the I guess we're looking to you the
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
best way to roll this out um and we want
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
to go to the Senate with a u a plan that
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
says this is doable this is uh
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
worthwhile this is going to you know
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
make our workplaces uh more safe we
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
heard some last week about how uh you
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
know the uh uh slips and falls and those
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
types of things are the most common
 
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
types of uh uh workplace injuries I
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't think we're trying to address the
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
most common ones we're trying to address
 
01:13:59.550 --> 01:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
the most serious ones and having more
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
complete safety standards we'll make
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
sure that the serious injuries and the
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
and the um fatalities on the job um
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're not common now we want to make
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
them far less common um non-existent if
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
possible um that's the objective of
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
um yep Mr chairman if I if I may please
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm sitting here wondering you
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
know um there's a couple of things that
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
are going through my head as we're
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
discussing this but if there's things
 
01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
within the 1910 that don't apply and we
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
are throwing out a broad net of safety
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
standards that may or may not be
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
followed or may or may not be read or
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
known by half the people or half of the
 
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
entities I guess I wonder what the value
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
is in that and the other thing that I I
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
guess I would like to share is is
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
something that I experienced yesterday
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
with road paving in our town um with the
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
state do uh you know and and when I
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
experienced this my first thought came
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
right back to the subcommittee and the
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
discussions that we're having and who's
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
in charge of what and what safety
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
Protocols are F so I'm driving up the
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
road and they're Paving on my Lane so
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
the flagger directs me to the other the
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
other lane to go around it and as I'm
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
going up and around it the Flagger is
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
alongside the road and it's a narrow
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
road talking with other do or other
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
employees of Continental Paving I'm not
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
sure but they're occupying a space in my
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
Lane so now I'm forced to cross back
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
into where they're Paving where the
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
equipment is so I'm sitting there saying
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
why are these guys standing where
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're standing in the road because
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's just an accident waiting to
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
happen and now they're forcing me to
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
drive on T that hasn't been put down and
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
I'm getting it all splattered over my
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
car and I'm in them now the travel Lane
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
of the paving guy so I immediately
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
thought back to our safety standards
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
who's following what and here we have
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
private sector and public sector working
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
side by side on a job who's following
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
what and the flagger could get hit those
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
employees could have gotten hit if I had
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
my phone in my hand and was not paying
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
hit and part of what brings us here is
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh when uh Tom wooden uh was killed some
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
years ago on a public sector job um and
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh you that's uh part of the inspiration
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
for U for being here so I I agree with
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
you excuse me representative I where was
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
that location no no no no no nice try
 
01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we're here is to make
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
the um we had talked
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
about I had mentioned um implementing
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
certain parts of it and and and you'd
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
rather go with a full thing but then you
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
also full full
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
1910 uh and then but then you wanted
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
to exclude certain things right you
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
wanted some especially this one with
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
this machine is is made
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
overseas so I'm okay with one I find
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
them both I find the same thing and it's
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
saying it said a different way if you
 
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
want to implement all of 19 and exclude
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
them things or just implment part of
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
1910 it doesn't matter to me either way
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
but as long as there's the ability which
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
you seem amable to to certain things
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
that may not be either feasible right
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
now or too cost costly right
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
now and I I guess um that's something
 
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
that we may may need to work out exactly
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
how to word that but but we were talking
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
prior to the uh um meeting today day of
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh um possibly having some some form of
 
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
um temporary grandfathering um that
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
allows um the dees for example to uh
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
continue using their uh very expensive
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
um effective and non-compliant uh
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
equipment um for a period of time it'll
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
have to be um replaced eventually
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
anyways um so when it's replaced it
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
should be replaced with something that
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
is compliant
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
but doing something like that I think I
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
think works um
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh but um I just I I don't think the uh
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
partial implementation of of the of the
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
standards is is is going to work that's
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
going to cause confusion but basically
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
where there is a problem and
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
um if we can come up with a general
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
provision for um
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh temporary grandfathering maybe
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
maybe that would work um but um and and
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
have the department authorized to figure
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
out where that fits and where it doesn't
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm going to ask you to
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
think about that and when we um do get
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
together um perhaps that's something
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
that U we can um try to work on
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
so L thank you Mr chairman um I'm a fan
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
of the slow walk um I'm not a fan of
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
dropping dropping all of it um I know
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
we've been in discussions for over a
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
year the department know knows the
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
direction we want to go um coming from
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
an area with very small towns anything
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
we Implement within the next two or
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
three years is going to take them two or
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
three years through the budget Cycles or
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
we need to you know get this new trash
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
compactor that has you know the two-hand
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
thing on it you operate by your foot I
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
mean stuff like that um so I I'm happy
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
to be part of this but we have to be
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
aware that the smaller towns that only
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a few employees that have to go to
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
town meeting and town budget and work
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
this out and this out and and get the
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
funding for it and raise the taxes for
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
it that we give them the ability to do
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
that without having open cases for years
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
of these towns so we have to have
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
extended um government oversight into
 
01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
these areas um I mean I like a
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
three-year a three-year idea of easy
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
hard medium and hard I mean if we have
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
to Grant exceptions we should be able to
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
Pivot that and have the department grant
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
exceptions or grandfathers or extension
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
or anything like that so we have the
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
ability to be flexible and through the
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
time we've always wanted to do with the
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way we don't want to come
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
in and have the heavy-handed of Oso on
 
01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
the backs of the public employers um or
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
have the fines or have the things with
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
the plan that we were talking about and
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
all that other stuff I mean we want to
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
do it our way we should be able to let
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
the department do it their way and we
 
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to you know not hold
 
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:49.719 align:start position:0%
their hand but you know say hey we want
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
we we want to see something change and I
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
think it's been made clear through the
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
last year we've been talking about this
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
that this is coming one way or another
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
let's do it together yeah
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
um and and I I guess the temporary
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
grandfathering uh is is something that
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
would I I think do what you're looking
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
for if I'm not mistaken that essentially
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
allow a uh an employer to say look we
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
realize that there's a standard here
 
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
that U
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
is implemented as of
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
June 1st 2025 let's say
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
um but we but we need time to make the
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment that that uh grandfathering
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
could occur but it would have to you
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
know you'd have to say it can only go on
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
if you know for a threeyear period or
 
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
something like that and then um then
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
they would have to make uh make the
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment but it would give them time
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
to budget give them time to plan um and
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know get ready basically um but they
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
they they would understand and and that
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
might be the the piece so I guess I'm
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
going to ask you folks to think about
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
that that idea and
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
um when we start crafting an amendment
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
that's something that uh I think if we
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
could say we're going to adopt these
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
standards as of this
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
date but we are going to allow um a
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
period time to get uh uh for the
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
employers to get fully um compliant does
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
that make sense to you as long as they
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
have they understand that they have to
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
maintain the current
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
standards until they have you know so
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
for instance if that Machinery that they
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to replace to bring to 1910
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
breaks they're going to have to repair
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
it at least to current standards and
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
operated under current standards until
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
the the grandfathering period is over
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
um we don't want to create a
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding where they think they
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
have a free-for-all until that
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
grandfather period is
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.430 align:start position:0%
 
concern

01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
concern
okay

01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
removing um removing the standards could
 
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
we just maybe have language in there
 
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
that says where that there's going to be
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
a minimum standard and then there's
 
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
going to be an OSHA standard effective
 
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
2025 but they need to maintain the
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
minimum standard now and in 2025
 
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be an enhan enhanced standard
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
just like when we pass you new building
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
codes and when we pass this or that this
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
is coming in 2025 you have to have
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
certain things or fire code or
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
electrical code stuff like that that
 
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
we're updating could we do that same
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
thing here there's a minimum standard
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to keep in place until
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
we have the enhanced standard standard
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
would that be helpful instead of just
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
wiping everything out and then bringing
 
01:24:02.189 --> 01:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
hammer I think it can kind of cut both
 
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:05.719 align:start position:0%
ways I mean to your point I think it
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
could be helpful in that you know of
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
course we're maintaining the current
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
standards um and informing all the
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that this is what's coming
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
down um to the other point that's prob
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
been discussed today
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
though depending on how it's implemented
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
I could see parts of it being confusing
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know if people are looking at one
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
and say okay I see there's in essence
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
two different standards for ladders of
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
our current standards say
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
are basically the same to a point and
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
the ocean standards are more
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
robust again it could just cause a
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion so I mean it
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
really boils down to how that's actually
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
implemented I think that that is
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
potentially feasible but mechanically
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
and procedurally how that goes will be
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
key there I would say thank you and
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's a followup Mr chairman
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
um so what would prevent you today from
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
going back to your office implementing a
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
new ladder standard sending that over to
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
Jael car in your 1400 and getting it
 
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
done without our
 
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
intrusion um nothing would specifically
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
and never has um you know hindered that
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
per se um obviously with the last couple
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
of years with these discussions of
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
course you know the it's it's kind of
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
been back and forth of where these would
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
really go if they statutory law versus
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules but yes to your
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
point we are able to do do that um
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
obviously as I'm sure the committee is
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
aware that if we were to say try and do
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
the whole of 1910s in our administrative
 
01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
rules that would be a very very lengthy
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
process with JL car because you know
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
they have to go through line by line
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
even if we say this is carbon copied
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
from OSHA they nonetheless have to still
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
go through it line by line which which
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
is the reason why Deputy Commissioner
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
Ogden uh said it would be uh more
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
effective simply uh reference 1910
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
rather than um
 
01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
trying to adopt piece by piece by piece
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
by piece um and and there are per
 
01:25:59.070 --> 01:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
sections of it that are irrelevant to
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
the public sector Employers in um New
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but you you adopt the whole
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
thing and you um uh you use a pieces
 
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:11.719 align:start position:0%
that are relevant and again relevant to
 
01:26:11.719 --> 01:26:18.350 align:start position:0%
that are relevant and again relevant to
different

01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
employers but I guess
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:25.950 align:start position:0%
employers but I guess
uh

01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
I hear hear what you're saying about uh
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
um maintaining the old standards while
 
01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
moving towards the new standards I'm not
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
sure how you put that into into the bill
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and it would be confusing to have two
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
different standards in place at the same
 
01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:47.709 align:start position:0%
different standards in place at the same
time

01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
um would it be feasible to Simply um re
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
reference Uh current standards say oceia
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
standards are the one in place
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
um and they will be um fully implemented
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
by XD they're imple they're adopted as
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
of this date fully
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
implemented some period of time down the
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
road a couple years later um and in the
 
01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
meantime um employers will be expected
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
to uh maintain at least the current
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
level of uh
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
safety so we're talking about the
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
difference between an effective date and
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
something actually in the bill that's
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
stating when um some sort of Grandfather
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
right I mean I I think we can handle it
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
the same as we do with an effective date
 
01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
where it's just States you know until
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
the such time you know you know I think
 
01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a five-year Grace
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
period or grandfather or threee so you
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
know Machinery that is that is currently
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
up to code uh with respect to the uh can
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
maintain the the 1400 lab rules as of X
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
date um until such time until the three
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
years is up something to that degree
 
01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:16.709 align:start position:0%
years is up something to that degree
okay

01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay another
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
idea let's go go
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
ahead so one of the one of the things
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about is
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
capacity um you currently have an
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
obligation to
 
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
review um an an employee has an
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
obligation every two years to look at
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
their plan and revise their plan and you
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to make sure that's
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
happening so that based on the number of
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
employers in the state is a big lift so
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
that's number one um number two when was
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
when was the last time that there was a
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
wholesale uh you know re revision of um
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
of the lab rules relative to safety and
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
health because you talk about you talk
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
about big gaps currently in this that
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
are exist in the current lab
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
rules so when was the last time they did
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
a wholesale kind of so it has not been
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
wholesale but just this past um a few
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
months ago we did revise our 600 rules
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
review of update them um we had I we
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
were the plan is to do the 1400 rules
 
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
that is going to be revised uh this year
 
01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
so we do review them um and so under
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner Maryfield he does have us
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
all on a schedule to look at our lab
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
rooms and review them um annually so um
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
we have done that for the 600s in the
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
next plan is to do that for the
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
1400s we having a little trouble hearing
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
you because of sorry so just reviewed
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
our we just reviewed our 600 lab rules
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to be reviewing our
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
1400 lab rules uh there was some
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not it would
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
be impacted by this bill um and whether
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
we should tackle them or not that's the
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
only thing that's I think at our that
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
that was that's why we did the 600 first
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
um but then the plan was to go over the,
 
01:30:16.109 --> 01:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
1400 so we do review them
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
annually and what do you if I could what
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
is the guidance that you use when you're
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
revising elabor what is the standard
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
that you that you uh Target yourself
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
towards so we look at what our current
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know we look at our case studies you
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
know is there something that's being
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
that's causing confusion uh is there
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
something that is not is routinely not
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
being adhered to and why we try to
 
01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
address that with our you know revisions
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
rules is an attorney
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
um discretionary enforcement I was an
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
inspector for years the city of
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester we were Guided by zoning
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
ordinances the fire rules all of those
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of things work as comp is Guided
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
law what I'm hearing you say in some
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
cases is that it is a
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
discretionary um situation where you
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
interpret Things based on your
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
experience and and all of those kinds of
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
things that come together and I
 
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
understand that so but there is a gap
 
01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.189 align:start position:0%
understand that so but there is a gap
Gap

01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
Gap
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
though would you agree that there
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
without a proper standard there
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
potentially could be a
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
gap in the way that this is in the way
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
that you interpret things and you go
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
from one inspector to the other
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
inspector to another inspector without a
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
without a good
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
standard the possibility for
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
discretionary enforcement would you
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
agree that that's a potential there is
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
there's um so during the course of an
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
inspection you're talking about I'm
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
talking about one
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
you take if what do you have three or
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
four inspectors I think I have two
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
currently with one opening it's been
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
open for a while let get them fills I am
 
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
trying so I also have D is here so I'll
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
be talking to them about one of the uh
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
positions that I have open do you have I
 
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
mean Ina in the case of comp you have
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
case law you have the law of the on the
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
books you have all these kinds of things
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
that enter into how decisions are made
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
so the question I have is is if absent a
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
standard like oser or some other
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
National Standard how how do you how do
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
you uh overcome that that discretionary
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
potentially discretionary enforcement so
 
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
there is a reasonable standard that we
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
need to maintain so a person can
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
challenge my inspector's you know
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
position which again I review um and if
 
01:32:43.709 --> 01:32:43.719 align:start position:0%
they can challenge it and it gets goes
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
to a superior court review so so that's
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
where and so that's where the
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
justification sometimes we do lean on
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
OSHA to support why our position is
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable and we try to tack it on to
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
either the facts and circumstances of
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
the case where you know it was
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable for them for us to say you
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
need to implement the training your your
 
01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
safety program as you wrote it um you
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
know because that person was not taught
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
the proper well was not taught to
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
utilize directionals and you're not
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
enforcing your safety program or they
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
were taught and you're not disciplining
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
them for not using it um oh so that's so
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
the facts will either support our Justus
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
our our reasonable recommend our um
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan um or we can rely
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
on a gen you know what is generally done
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
within that um industry like industry
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
standard as reasonable so there is that
 
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
check of of the court that we you know
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
so that's why we do off you know we're
 
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
not you know during um coid a hazmat
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
suit would have been the most effective
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
way to protect someone but is that
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable so um you know so that's
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
something that would allow allowed us
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
some just you know we had to do research
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out how close to those lines
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
can we get and uphold the reasonable
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
standards in a court of
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
law one issue that came up here that I
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
think is um is worthwhile
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
discussing uh there our standards that
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
currently exist for prisons for nursing
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
homes uh in fact OSHA doesn't cover some
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
of these I don't oia doesn't cover
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
prisons it's a separate standard so when
 
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
we talk about enforcing uh OSHA
 
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
standards for the prisons it's a
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
different standard firefighters have a a
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
whole different you know so I as you as
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
we talk through this how we accommodate
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
those differences um something we we
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
need to talk about because if we were to
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
drop the OSHA standard on there's going
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
to be all these gaps that that are not
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to apply so they currently what we
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
do in those issues again we have this
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
reasonableness and so like when we talk
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
about how our inspectors are not trained
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
specific specifically to oia they're you
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
really have to look at them as more like
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
expert researchers trying to figure so
 
01:34:59.709 --> 01:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
we do again inspect you know serious
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
bodily injuries to Firefighters uh you
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
know more frequently than we would like
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
um but that's just the nature of the job
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um and when we look at
 
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
that we are looking at the fire
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
standards you know are they adhering to
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
the training so we're not looking at
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
OSHA we're not looking you at our own
 
01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
laws per se we are looking at other you
 
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
know the other laws from the outside
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
held okay and the the only final thing I
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
would say is that the beneficiaries of
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
good safety programs are the communities
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
and other people uh the the businesses
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
and the communities and stuff and I'm
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
really surprised that the insurance
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
industry is not
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
here because they were here initially
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
when we started talking about about
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
safety standards and they have been the
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries in fact a more recent um
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
article by beton Court uh shows a a ma a
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
significant curve significant uh slope
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of cost savings for
 
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
employers uh so they've been the
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of of of safety and health
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
programs and other things over the
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
course of the years and stuff that we
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
negotiated uh with them some years ago
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm surprised they're not here saying
 
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
that we would perhaps like better uh
 
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement better law
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
to help um to help with providing safety
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
and finally slips and Falls uh account
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
for thousands of injuries in New
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by your own numbers thousands
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
over 10,000 uh slips and Falls alone uh
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
were reported by in your biannual
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
report and we should see another
 
01:36:45.149 --> 01:36:45.159 align:start position:0%
biannual report soon correct one's
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
coming out in October October 1st it's
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
du I believe that that is correct
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative I know it's it is
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
forthcoming at a minimum though it's
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
been worked on for some time do you have
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
any sense of how much money will be
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
turned back to the uh State of New
 
01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
back I
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
believe and this is just off the top of
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
my head just memory I believe it was
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
close to 3 million for the last fiscal
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
year um obviously we're in the infancy
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
of the new fiscal year so hard to tell
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
of like any sort of projections um and I
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
I would have no reason to talk to our
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
accounting Bureau at this juncture for
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
that but I believe that it was a shade
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
under three million was to give back to
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
the general fund in the last fiscal year
 
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Labor 2 million
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
the last F correct
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr sorry thank you Mr
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um hearing some of the um
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
discussion we just had was could there
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
be an adoption date for 1910 could there
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
be an effective date for 1910 and could
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
there be an enforcement date for
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
1910 could those
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
be utilized to get where we want to be
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
could we say we're going to adopt them
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
in 25 we're going to they'll become
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
effective in 26 and we're going to start
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
27 is that something that we would be
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
able to do as legislators
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
to do that for you guys or is it
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
something that you would not want us to
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
do because it would tie your hands for
 
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
effective dates or enforcement dates it
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
would also give you guy obviously the
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
department enough time to say okay yeah
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
we're they're dropping this in our lap
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
in 25 we're going to have to you know
 
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
effective it in 26 and we're going to
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
have to sign enforcing it in 27 that
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
also gives you three years to notify the
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
200 M municipalities that we that you
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
oversee or things like that to get that
 
01:38:46.679 --> 01:38:47.470 align:start position:0%
oversee or things like that to get that
ball

01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
ball
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
rolling in 25 or 24 or whatever
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
I would say on its face it definitely
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like a feasible um implementation
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
schedule caveat being that um obviously
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
director roas and I can't speak to
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of that you know when
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking funding um things that are
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner level type things so
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
again on its face I think that that
 
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
would be feasible potentially and again
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's it all goes back to mechanically
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
and procedurally how this actually is
 
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
implemented but a schedule like that I
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
think would be
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
feasible like boots on the ground you
 
01:39:23.229 --> 01:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
know for the inspectors and for what we
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
would need to do for finding you know
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
new Consultants um establishing that
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
program but again there's other pieces
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
well yes um that would also give you the
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
ability to say okay well we have these
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
standards this is what we need to
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
enforce them we need two more um
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
inspectors we need another support
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
person we need an assistant commissioner
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
another assistant commissioner for that
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
area to enforce that could that be part
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
of the I don't want to say enforcement
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism but could that be
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient to the point where you
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
could say okay we need three more
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
employees we give back $3 million we
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
need to withhold 400,000 out of that to
 
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
keep these three
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
employees yeah if if I'm understanding
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
your question correctly I think that
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that could be helpful for us in the
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
sense that obviously we can uh do
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
analysis um but it's a guess at the end
 
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
of the day until we start implementing
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
um at least to a point of what the
 
01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
department would need for you know you
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
know more funding well not funding
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
rather because again as it's been stated
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
we give back to the general fund but for
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
more positions um you know where the
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
give back would end up be projection
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
wise and everything um so we could kind
 
01:40:34.510 --> 01:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
of re-evaluate and say yeah we came here
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
we said that we need x amount of
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
positions of Consultants given the
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
volume of stakeholders that have come to
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
the department we now realize we need y
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
amount which is an increase so I think
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
that could be helpful in that sense
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
again just the the standard caveat being
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
that there's you know POS positions and
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
pieces of that that frankly we're just
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
not privy to in our
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
positions last fall was go ahead
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
um and I can certainly understand all
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot there's a lot of
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
open-ended questions that we have today
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
um that we've been working towards
 
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
closing the Gap in this legislation get
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
it through and then get it over to the
 
01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.669 align:start position:0%
it through and then get it over to the
Senate

01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
um if we did slow walk
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
it which the the impl through the
 
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
implementation process um what support
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
would you want from us to say okay well
 
01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
we can't do this in a year can we adjust
 
01:41:28.119 --> 01:41:28.950 align:start position:0%
we can't do this in a year can we adjust
this

01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
date would you want to come back to us
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
and have it have us do another amendment
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
or would you rather have this law saying
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to do get it
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
done by this time or we're going to be
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
filing this is it is it something that
 
01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:42.149 align:start position:0%
filing this is it is it something that
we

01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
can just try find trying to find a happy
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
medium so everybody's happy here yeah
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say yeah communication is
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
always key with these things because you
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
know the last thing any of us would want
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
is you know we kind of have a general
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
agreement and then three years down the
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
line you know we have to come here and
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
testify and say yeah this isn't working
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
out for anybody um so again hard to say
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
on its face right now but I I I think it
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
would obviously be helpful if it's kind
 
01:42:08.669 --> 01:42:08.679 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
um if it's something that as we're going
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
through if we are going to do a slow
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
walk implementation that it's uh a
 
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
coordination between us and the
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
legislature um in you know us updating
 
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
you guys to say this is where we're at
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
this is what we're seeing um and trying
 
01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
to get ahead of potential issues in the
 
01:42:29.229 --> 01:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
future then how I also Invision our
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
audits if you do a slow walk process our
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
audits will be kind of done in under the
 
01:42:37.589 --> 01:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
each category so what it looks like
 
01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
under so we can give them help the towns
 
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
and the counties plan you're under
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're you know you're in current
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
compliance with X but please note that
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
when we go into the next one these are
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
the things you're going to be needing to
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
plan to address and then by the time we
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
get to the final stage this is what
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking for so that
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
they can also project and as we get
 
01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
feedback from the towns with the various
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
you know issues that they're presenting
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
for wire white that would not be
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
possible we could bring that back to
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
you and I I'm attracted to what
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
representative avalani is uh suggesting
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I'm going to say again
 
01:43:17.119 --> 01:43:18.510 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I'm going to say again
that

01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think we need guidance from the
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
Department as exactly how that would
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure what the difference
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
between adopting and effective date
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
is um but essentially there's it's not a
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
bad idea to say okay we we are I'm
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
making a commitment that these are going
 
01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
to be our standards we're not we're
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to and and frankly the the repeal
 
01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
date um would be delayed as well you
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
would leave the current standards in
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
place you would commit to the OSHA
 
01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.270 align:start position:0%
place you would commit to the OSHA
standards

01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
um give time for everybody to get ready
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
the department the employers everyone
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
has uh a gap in time but the law says
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
we're going here and this is the date
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
um if you if you could work on that so
 
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
that we can put that into an amendment I
 
01:44:25.950 --> 01:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
think that would
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh that would be I think would be
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
helpful for everybody it
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
would reduce a lot of the anxiety around
 
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
this Mr chairman I have just one um
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
comment about the just a little
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
housekeeping of the bill if you look at
 
01:44:44.189 --> 01:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
the original bill that was filed it
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
talks about implementing
 
01:44:49.229 --> 01:44:49.239 align:start position:0%
1910 letter D through Z with the
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
exception of U
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
so I have the outline of what a through
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
z is and you that you want excluded is
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
coid 19 items V WX and Y are reserved
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing there so I think we
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.709 align:start position:0%
through uh
whatever

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
T and then part Z because I don't want
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
to implement something here part v
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
through Y which has nothing there and
 
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
could be just you know attorney Garner
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
you do you recall what
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh that reserved section is I I I I I
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
think it is literally just reserved for
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
when OSHA is if they choose to implement
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
an entirely new standard you know you're
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
not adding to um you know we want
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
ladders or scaffolding to be a little
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
bit more safe there's some new things
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
where they say and I would say I don't
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
know his torically but my guess is
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
subpart U up until 2020 was probably
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
reserved so I think it's for scenarios
 
01:45:58.830 --> 01:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
like that so they're not kind of adding
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
on uh ZZ AA um and they just have you
 
01:46:04.830 --> 01:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
know a through z so I in in that sense
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's how I understand it to be
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
reserved it's not something I've
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
researched by any means um but I think
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's really all it is at the end of
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
the day and it's subpart um uh
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative infanti is pointing out
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
subpart C is also reserved is that
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
probably something that was repealed at
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
some point uh again it's not something
 
01:46:28.589 --> 01:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
that I've researched by any means my
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
guess just speculatively would be that
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
they probably intended to have one of
 
01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
the initial subparts um Reserve just in
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
case they needed to do what I would
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
consider more like housekeeping
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
definition section something along those
 
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
lines so you're not adding something
 
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
that really should be at the start of a
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
law into like subpart Z or somewhere
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
there so it's like up front people can
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
actually see it again that's just a
 
01:46:59.709 --> 01:46:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
though your your build GL section A
 
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:04.589 align:start position:0%
though your your build GL section A
through

01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
so want I don't want I want I don't want
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
to put something in there that
 
01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:25.639 align:start position:0%
we have to follow WX and Y right when we
 
01:47:27.790 --> 01:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what they are yet what they
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:36.589 align:start position:0%
 
Som

01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.599 --> 01:47:42.589 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
committee I guess um
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you folks uh send an
 
01:47:55.229 --> 01:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
email to representative infantine and
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
myself uh suggesting a um a date to get
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
together next week um time and date and
 
01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.750 align:start position:0%
together next week um time and date and
um

01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
there's my schedule is reasonably open
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
after Monday um I don't know what your
 
01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:10.109 align:start position:0%
after Monday um I don't know what your
schedule

01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:48:10.119 --> 01:48:11.669 align:start position:0%
schedule
is

01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
well depends on any given day I'm sorry
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay if you could just make a a
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion or a couple of suggestions as
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
to when we might get together
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
um hopefully we can um Iron some of this
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
stuff out uh on the side and then uh
 
01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
bring it back to this group and I guess
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that we will not meet
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
next week but would would meet the
 
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
following week to um put that
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
together thank you thank
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.669 --> 01:48:50.679 align:start position:0%
adjourned uh I I I don't want to put
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
Tyler on the
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
spot but at some point I would like to
 
01:48:56.589 --> 01:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
hear from the from the firefighters
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
relative to how oer and the the national
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
standards for fire the Govern
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters um how those integrate uh
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't expect you answer that now
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh I would suspect that you know there's
 
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
not a standard in the fire station for
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
the stairs being slippery it's not under
 
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
ocean it's not under you know current
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
NFPA standards but so being interested
 
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
to hear how those and if there's
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
anything as we draft this uh as it
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
relates to Firefighters or prisons or
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
other nursing homes if there is
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
something that we should take into
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
you
