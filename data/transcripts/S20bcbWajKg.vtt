00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
the bill to us good morning
 
00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the community uh
 
00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
for the record I am Wendy Thomas and I
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
represent the town of marac I'm here
 
00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
today to introduce uh House Bill
 
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
306 which is an act establishing a
 
00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
commission to study the short and
 
00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts of pending National
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
and Regional carbon pricing mechanisms
 
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire's citizens businesses
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
institutions and
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
environment carbon pricing is a
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
market-based strategy to reduce
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a
 
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
monetary cost to emitting carbon dioxide
 
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
and other greenhouse gases it
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
incentivizes businesses and individuals
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
to lower their emissions by making it
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
more expensive to pollute the goal is to
 
00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
encourage cleaner energy use innovation
 
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
and efficiency while addressing climate
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
change other countries are already using
 
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing in order to lower costs
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
while the impacts of climate disruption
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
increase this economic lever insulates
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
consumers while putting the cost where
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
it belongs without a price signal
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
consumers remain at the mercy of a pro
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
of a market that is unfair because their
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
product doesn't include those
 
00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 align:start position:0%
externalized costs passing this bill
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to New Hampshire's
 
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
economy for several
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
reasons house bills 60 uh 306 sorry
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
ensures New Hampshire prepares for the
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
economic changes that could arise from
 
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
Regional or national carbon mechanisms
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
by studying these impacts the state can
 
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
avoid being caught off guard and
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
Implement strategies to mitigate
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
potential negative effects while
 
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
capitalizing on
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities understanding how carbon
 
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
pricing affects businesses allows the
 
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
state to create policies that protect
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
local industries from disproportionate
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
costs the study could help shape
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
measures to keep New Hampshire
 
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
businesses competitive especially in
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
Industries vulnerable to International
 
00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 align:start position:0%
competition carbon pricing mechanis
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms often reduce greenhouse gas
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
emissions which can improve air quality
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
healthier populations typically result
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
in lower healthare costs and increase
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
productivity positively impacting the
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
State state's
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
economy the study would evaluate how
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing might influ influence
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
state energy costs in the short and long
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing is becoming common common
 
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
globally and in the US studying its
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
impacts positions New Hampshire to
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
remain competitive in a transitioning
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%

toward carbon pricing
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
mechanisms the study commission ensures
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
that any decision about implementing
 
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing is based on thorough
 
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 align:start position:0%
research and consideration of its
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%

the environment
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
this prevents rushed or poorly designed
 
00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 align:start position:0%
policies that could harm the economy the
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
study also examines how collected fees
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
might be returned to the residents
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%

burdens by understanding the long-term
 
00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
impacts the state can identify ways to
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
transition away from fossil fuels reduce
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
dependence on vol energy markets and
 
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
create a more sustainable and resilient
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
economy this bill acknowledges that the
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
outside world economies are already
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
using carbon pricing and we owe it to
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's energy consumers to
 
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
understand how the global market excuse
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
me the global market signals will impact
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
energy rates here by passing this bill
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
we ensure that New Hampshire remains
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
economically competitive environmentally
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
306 I have a couple of quick questions
 
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
for you is this the same bill that the
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
house defeated last year I believe it is
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
okay and the second question is the
 
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire or the
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislature already has about 200
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
Commissions in existence do you know if
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
there are any other commissions that
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
could take on this work uh without us
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
having to establish a new commission I
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
do not believe there is another
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
commission that could do that and I
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
understand we have a lot of commissions
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
but the importance of this to New
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy to uh its Industries
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
and to the health of its citizens I
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
think makes it a priority okay thank you
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
other questions for the representative
 
00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:26.550 align:start position:0%
other questions for the representative
representative

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah just one question uh you
 
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
talk about national uh carbon tax given
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
the events of yesterday do you really
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
think there's any chance we're going to
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
see a national carbon tax within the
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
years when you say given yesterday do
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
you mean uh the the change of
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
administration you yeah Donald Trump
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
being president what he said I do you
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
think that there's a chance that they're
 
00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
going to P he's going to sign a carbon
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
tax in the law in the next four years no
 
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
I don't however I think that the other
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
countries are going to to be uh actively
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
pursuing carbon fees and carbon uh uh
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
pricing and it's uh it's important for
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to see what the
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
implications of that to our specific
 
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.550 align:start position:0%
implications of that to our specific
economy

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
is other questions representative Kaplan
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
has one I got two questions uh for
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
representative uh Wendy Thomas I'm gonna
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
uh ask you does this first of all is
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
does this commission intending to
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
recommend that New Hampshire establish a
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing mechanism and second ly
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
could you I'm just going to return your
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
favor in the question you asked me in my
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing could you more
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
specifically tell us how this would best
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
position New Hampshire businesses uh for
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
the future sure this commission is not
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
to uh recommend a carbon pricing at all
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
for for the State of New Hampshire it's
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
to look at the implications of carbon
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
pricing if we don't do it which is not
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
recommending that we do or if it's not
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
done on a national level um with regard
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
to the impact of of the
 
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.190 align:start position:0%
to the impact of of the
economy

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh we're in a situation where we're
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
we're we're tied to fossil fuels and
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels are becoming um more
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
disruptive to our environment and to our
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
health and so by putting um a a price on
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels it the money will will will
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
help the industries
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
there is a gentleman that's going to
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
come behind me um who will better be
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
that additional
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
you representative for introducing this
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'll call next on
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
representative cat McGee and while she
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
makes her way to the test to the table
 
00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:51.470 align:start position:0%
makes her way to the test to the table
to

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
testify I will
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh let you all know that we have eight
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
people who want to testif on this bill
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
so from this point forward the timer
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
will be turned on and you'll each have
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
minutes representative McGee good
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
morning good morning thank you Mr
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you me colleagues um
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
sorry for my voice I have a
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
cold okay um I'm representative cat
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
McGee Hillsboro 35 Hollis and I come to
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
you today not as a co-sponsor of this
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
bill but in support of the idea of a
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
study to learn learn more about the
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
impacts of carbon pricing on granite
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
sters uh the concept of carbon pricing
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
has been circulating around this
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
committee for as long as I've been on it
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
the number of countries using carbon
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
pricing was 46 when I first joined St in
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
2019 according to the World Bank report
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
in July of 2024 there are currently 75
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing instruments being
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
operated around the world Canada Mexico
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
and Panama are all using uh cap and
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
trade it's basically a cap and trade
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
program as an effective lowcost tool to
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
lower emissions while driving economic
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
growth uh the concept is to remove the
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
externalized costs of pollution from the
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
rate payer and place it on those that
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
are doing the polluting we have the
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative as an
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
example which is a large emitter cap and
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
trade program here in New England that
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
brings in an excess of $50 million uh
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
back to New Hampshire each
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
year uh Reggie was designed to give
 
00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
States money to invest in emissions
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
lowering projects and we elected to use
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
over 95% of the regional greenhouse gas
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
initiative funds uh as rebates uh to uh
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
those rate payers so in effect we turned
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
Reggie into a pass through program from
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
polluters to rate payers carbon pricing
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
is designed to pass the credits
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
collected from polluters Back to the
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
bill payers so it is not a net tax to
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
Consumers it is a stimulus to economies
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
where it is being used and that is why
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's been so popular as far as Global
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
adoption um but do we know what will
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
happen if the US stays outside of these
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
Global uh energy market price signals do
 
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
we know how New Hampshire's preparation
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
for these changing markets will help or
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
or hurt New Hampshire consumers I don't
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
think we do that is the reason for the
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
study since the us is the only country
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
in North America not pricing carbon can
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
we count on any economic impacts to the
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
cost of our energy uh costs here in the
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
state in 2025 New Hampshire has no plan
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
to inform ourselves on the benefits
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
costs or impacts to our constituents
 
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.829 align:start position:0%
costs or impacts to our constituents
energy

00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
bills hb36 asks the house committee on
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy to look at
 
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
the impacts of this global economic
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
policy on the state's ability to keep
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
energy costs low if we don't investigate
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
it we have no Knowledge from which to
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
propose a way forward for New
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hb36 is a study bill in the
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
first year of the bium that asks us to
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
shine more light on the idea that a
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
wider spread cap and trade program might
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
actually bring meaningful cost relief to
 
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.389 align:start position:0%
actually bring meaningful cost relief to
energy

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
consumers Would we not undertake any
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
policy that would do this all we need to
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
do is take a look and that is what I'm
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
asking for your consideration in passing
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
hb36 so that we have more information
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
with which to move forward as to what is
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
best for helping keep costs low and to
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
lower costs in the future for energy
 
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.269 align:start position:0%
lower costs in the future for energy
consumers

consumers
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you representative McGee
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to hear you have a cold yeah
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
hope you feel better soon thank you any
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions for representative McGee
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
has thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:10.710 align:start position:0%
has thank you Mr chair and thank you
representative

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
MC the
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh climate impacts or whatever are uh
 
00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
often mentioned in regard to this and
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
certainly if indeed the burning of
 
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels are affecting climate in an
 
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.710 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels are affecting climate in an
adverse

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
adverse
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
manner perhaps that would be a good
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
basis for promoting this but I'm
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
wondering the state uh passed a tax cut
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago and now I understand
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
that there are uh I'm sure that the ways
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
and means and finance are working on how
 
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.550 align:start position:0%
and means and finance are working on how
to

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
finance uh the state budget going
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
forward uh if there is uh and this
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
commission is just to do an assessment
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
if there were a a cap or a carbon tax is
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
there any estimate or would there be a
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
uh path forward to getting an estimate
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
of how much revenue it might bring to
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
the state if we could tax something that
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh we may you know uh there's
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
we don't want to invest in for the
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
future because uh we're having trouble
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
finding invest investors for the
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
long-term future
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a good question I think um
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
we've had we've had bills that that were
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
asking us to enact a cap and trade
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
program uh you know a carbon pricing
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
program that's not what this bill is
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
about though this Bill is saying we
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
should study what the impacts of the
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
existing market for those people who are
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
currently enacting uh these programs
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're in North America and no one else
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
in no other country in North America is
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
currently not doing this and so what we
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
want to look at is what are the
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
implications for us and our energy
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
Market based on the fact that we're
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
outside of those price signals and so
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
what does it make sense for us to do
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
does it make sense for us to pursue it
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
or are we better off not pursuing it we
 
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
don't have those answers that's what the
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to solve is to say what
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
is the best way forward because if we
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
claim that we're trying to help keep
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
people's costs low then we have to be at
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
least aware of the things that are
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
happening around us and how they will
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
affect those costs going forward so we
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
want to have a study rather than put it
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
off um so we have more information to go
 
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.190 align:start position:0%
off um so we have more information to go
forward

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
with representative schneller has a
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and I
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
thank the representative for a testimony
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering that the given much
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh sort of well given that the
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
underlying science is far from settled
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
um is it not premature to even consider
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
a commission to set up a scheme to trade
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
something that may or may not have an
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
impact um wouldn't isn't this just
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
extremely premature uh again the
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
committee isn't to study setting it up
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
the committee is to find out since 75
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
countries including all the other
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
countries in North America already
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
setting prices on their energy and us
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
not doing that we don't know what impact
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
that has on ratee payers in the in the
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
state so it's it's not trying to presume
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
any outcomes and it's not talking about
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
the science it's talking about the
 
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
economic policy in the energy sector
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
that says that folks are starting to
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
build in the externalized costs of
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
pollution to fossil fuel use and we are
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
not so what will that do to costs for
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
rate payers is it is it good for us is
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
it not good for us so that's it's really
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
more of an economic examination of the
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
reality of what's going on around us we
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to agree on climate change to
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
carbon does that answer your question I
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
don't because I think the question was
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
kind of taking us off base because I
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not discussing whether
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
um the science is settled that's think
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
the question was simply that I is it is
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
it not premature to set up a commission
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
to study something that may or may not
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
be taking place um why not set up a a
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
nitrogen study commission um a helium
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
study commission carbon pricing is
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
taking place so again we're we're
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
talking past each other I think carbon
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
pricing 75 countries including Canada
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
and Mexico our nearest trading partners
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
and the rest of North America they are
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
all pricing carbon we are not pricing
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
carbon what is the impact of that on the
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
rates that people in New Hampshire will
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay okay that's what we want to
 
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.669 align:start position:0%
have to pay okay that's what we want to
look

00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
at okay I'd remind members that we're
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
here to ask questions to elicit
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
information we don't want to have any
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
debates at this point in time
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan oh you have a
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
you uh representative McGee for for for
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
for testifying on this bill I'm
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
genuinely curious because I know that
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
you're you're somebody who thinks a lot
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
about energy issues and to follow up on
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's question U
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we are the only
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
country in North America that doesn't
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
have a carbon pricing mechanism and
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the European Union
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
our largest trading partner besides
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
Canada also has a carbon pricing
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
mechanism and given the events of
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday do you think that this uh
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
commission would have more or less
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
importance given yesterday's new
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you for the
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
question um I think rather than this
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
bill being premature I think it's
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
timely um I think with what is going on
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
currently in the energy economy globally
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
we owe it to our constituents to
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
understand what it means for rate payers
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um it it's not
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
talking about adopting it it's talking
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
about even if we don't adopt it we still
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
may have impacts for not participating
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
we should understand those um and they
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
can help inform Us in terms of policies
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
bium okay seeing no further questions
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
for the representative
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
I'll call on next Mr Michael sonunu from
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
welcome don't forget to turn on the
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
mic better there uh thank you very much
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
for giving me giving me the opportunity
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
to uh testify today on hp36 I'm here
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
representing myself um uh I have
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
attached a copy of a presentation I made
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Bia years ago on
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
the carbon tax and an important issues
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
that taken as a whole should steer this
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee away from approving hp36 uh I
 
00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559 align:start position:0%
updated the figures in that presentation
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
on page 14 to indicate the most recent
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
year of energy consumption in the state
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
and how an example of a $40 uh per per
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
ton carbon tax would cost consumers as
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
noted in that material though the
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
potential for raising taxes on pretty
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
much every family and business in the
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
state to the tune of at least a half a
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
billion dollars a year at that level
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's a poor track record of
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
legislators keeping to the commitments
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
of how these funds would be used the
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
state as well as as well as many other
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
states regularly try to raid uh clean
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
energy funds and and grab that money in
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
addition the inevitable ratcheting up of
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
taxes happens we see it going on in
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
places that have enacted C carbon taxes
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh like Canada that was just mentioned
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh more importantly the results of these
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
types of taxes always fall on families
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
and businesses no matter what good
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
intentions are put in place by
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
legislators there there's often flowly
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
language that insists that companies
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed to pass these
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
costs on to Consumers but statements
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
like that in my opinion are a tcid
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that they're going to be
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
passed on to comp on to Consumers that's
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
how the world Works beyond the issues
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
raised in that material I suggest the
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
members of this committee look at the
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
economics of imposing a carbon tax with
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
the best example right across the border
 
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
in Canada Canada as a whole passed a
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
carbon tax in
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
2019 uh and while they started the tax
 
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
at $20 per metric t for CO2 it's already
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
risen to $80 per ton in five short years
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
that's quadrupling the price while the
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
Canadian government implemented rebates
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
in order to sell the idea of a
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
broad-based carbon tax the economic
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
reality is is that families are paying
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars a year in higher
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
taxes because of the policy a recent
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
review of the numbers published by the
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
Parliamentary budget office in Canada
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
that was done by the Canadian taxpayers
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
Federation found that the carbon tax
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
will cost the average household in
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
Canada between $42 and $847 in 2023 even
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
after the
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
rebates looking at the projections from
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
the from the PBO it's only going to get
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
worse for families in Canada over the
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
next 5 to 10 years as a result there's
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
been major political backlash against
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
the liberal government driven by
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Revolt over the carbon tax it's
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
reached the point where the Prime
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
Minister Justin Trudeau had to resign
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
the liberal po party has been torn apart
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
and they'll likely face massive losses
 
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming elections this is a
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
lesson of the economic and political
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
realities of carbon tax in fact New York
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
State Governor hokel just announced that
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
she is going to delay the state from
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
considering her cap and invest program
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
and just uh this past week the largest
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
party in the European Parliament
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
announced that they are going to uh put
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
their carbon import tax on hold these
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
are the political realities it is not
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
that everybody's rushing to enact carbon
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
taxes they're actually moving away from
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
it on a global
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
basis lastly let me address a question
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
that comes up with legislation like hb36
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
which just establishes commissions right
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
there are dozens of organizations in the
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
state in the region or nationally that
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
Advocate on a regular basis for a carbon
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
tax many of these organizations receive
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars every year as just
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
one example 350.org which is a huge
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
advocate for eliminating fossil fuels
 
00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.559 align:start position:0%
and imposing policies like a carbon tax
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
for their 20222 tax year reported $20
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
million in revenues in that year and has
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
almost $15 million of assets on his
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
books why can't organizations that are
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
in favor of this type of activity form
 
00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:35.559 align:start position:0%
their own commissions invite elected
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
officials to serve on the commission ask
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
experts to testify before their
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
commission and have their commission put
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
out recommendations in my opinion it is
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
because they want the impr premature of
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
a state government on its actions and
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
recommendations these commissions are
 
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:50.919 align:start position:0%
almost always populated with individuals
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
who are already active in the policy
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
area that they're created to study
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
rarely did they cover new ground or
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
provide insightful analysis they
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
typically rehash existing materials and
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
put out pages and pages and pages of
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations but since their state
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
endorsed commissions it's inevitable
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
that some of these recommendations find
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
their way into influencing regulatory
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
policymaking regardless of whether the
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
legislature moves forward or not a great
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
example of this is the New Hampshire
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
Coastal risks and Hazard commission this
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
was established by SB 163 uh I think 11
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
years ago and it specifically stated
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
that the commission shall annually
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
report its findings and any
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations prop proposed
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
legislation to the speaker of the
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House the president of
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate the house clerk the Senate
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
clerk the governor and the State Library
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
the idea of this commission at least as
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
I recall in in the debate around it was
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
to provide guidance to the general court
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
and the governor for what should be done
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
if anything about about uh if if
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
anything about coastal flooding but as
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
could have been predicted back then the
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
pages and pages and pages of
 
00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:54.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations by the commission rarely
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
were adopted as legislation but much of
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
it is being adopted but unseen by the
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
general public and I would guess unseen
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
by many members of this committee rules
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
and policies are being made within Dees
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
do Regional planning authorities and
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
other organizations which get around the
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty of enacting legislation by
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
just quietly injecting restrictions on
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
development imposing unjustified new
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
building codes adopting honorous
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
infrastructure requirements and people
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
wonder why there's a housing crisis in
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
this state based on these reasons I urge
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
you all to reject a
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions excuse me so uh representative
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a
 
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh carbon pricing has been around for a
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
long time and with so many countries
 
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.070 align:start position:0%
long time and with so many countries
using

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
it do your does your research show that
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
the um overall temperature of the world
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
has come down or or that the emissions
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
have decreased significantly by these
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
you know uh countries you know using
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
that method so I I don't think this
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
legislation certainly doesn't uh I think
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
address the you know that particular
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
issue and I I don't I don't want to take
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
the committee's time up to debate that
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
um but let me just say that you know we
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
do have a a carbon a form of carbon tax
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
in the state and that's Reggie right
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
Reggie is a a form of regulation on
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions from uh power
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
generators and it's imposed across the
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
state and in the region as a whole um I
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
will say this the Northeast where Reggie
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
exists and places like California that
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
has something similar to Reggie in terms
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
of carbon trading they have the highest
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
energy cost in the country the states
 
00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:47.559 align:start position:0%
that have imposed this have high energy
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
costs so I think that should be a
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
serious concern when you're looking at
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh even considering or debating the idea
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh one additional question before I let
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
you go I understand that you serve as a
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
selectman in your town of newfields
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's correct I've been there nine
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
years do you think uh studying a carbon
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
tax would be important for the members
 
00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:14.919 align:start position:0%
of your
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
community well um uh let me let me say
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
this so you know a carbon tax at the end
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
of the day is is is really tax on energy
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
and from the perspective of somebody on
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
the local level at a select board I
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
served as a welfare officer in in
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
newfields for years um and the the
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
concern uh the issue that we had to most
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
often deal with as a welfare officer is
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
energy costs for uh low-income families
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
who live there and in the winter facing
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
huge electricity bills uh heating oil
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
problems um and so this certainly I
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
think a carbon tax would exacerbate that
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
um and and let me just say in addition
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
as a small community we're constantly
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
looking for development of our
 
00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
commercial manufacturers we have a large
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in town um they they you
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
know they provide a lot of taxes and
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
that helps alleviate property taxes for
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
the families in town um higher energy
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
costs are what Drive businesses
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
Industries out of the state we've seen
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
it happen numerous on numerous occasions
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
right sixh hour expanded in Arkansas
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
because the energy prices up here are
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
too high uh I think it would be
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
crippling for my town to lose Hutchin
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
and ceiling system
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
because energy costs get too high and a
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
carbon tax is going to make energy costs
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
more expensive for businesses like that
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day they'll leave
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
and the other families in town are going
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
to have to pick up the the the benefit
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
of of the property taxes that they
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
pay thank you additional questions
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chair Mr sen you you
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
started off mentioning you updated a
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
document page 14
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I I forwarded this to to
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
the chairman with my testimony this was
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
a presentation I did to the New
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bia uh about seven or eight
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
years ago that contains a lot of data on
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
on carbon taxes um I sent it in PDF
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
format I I apologize I I didn't realize
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
that that you as as members didn't get
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
it the the the the key aspect of that
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
just you know to if if you're going to
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
if if it gets circulated and look around
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
is on page 14 you know I I basically
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
identify the the usage of uh fossil
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
fuels here in the state and a a $40 per
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
ton carbon tax which is you know around
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
the typically what is typically
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
discussed you're talking about um
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
costing in just in New Hampshire not
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
regionally but just in New Hampshire
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
$500 million of additional taxes that
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
would come from a carbon tax now it
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
could be determined to to deal with that
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
in a variety of ways they could spend it
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
on new programs they could you know do a
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
rebate program like they did in Canada
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
but you you know that's the key takeaway
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
from this document and and I I assume
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
that the the chairman will be able to
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
circulate that thank you I will do that
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
and I apologize to the members of the
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee for not circulating it last
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
night uh I think I got distracted by the
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
Notre Dame Ohio
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
State any additional questions from
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has one thank you
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for coming in Mr
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
senuna uh from your testimony it sounds
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
like not only are you opposed to this
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
bill but you're opposed to any kind of
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
state commission any kind of uh task
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
force any kind of uh government uh
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
attempt at all to deal with uh the
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
problems of the externalities of the
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
energy system that we're currently uh
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
under and so my question to you is is is
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
a you know sort of a conceptual question
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
would you not agree that uh the the
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
public bearing the cost of those
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
externalities constitutes a subsidy for
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
the fossil fuel companies that would far
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
outweigh the $20 million that you
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that a lobbying group such as
 
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
350.org uh enjoys uh to carry out its
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
operations so your question opens up a
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
broader area that uh I'd be happy to go
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
down but I don't think the committee
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
probably wants spent time on that and
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
that is the evaluation of the
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
externalities versus the benefits that
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels provide for everyday life I
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
I can say for certain that we couldn't
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
hold this hearing today nobody could get
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
here today this room would not be heated
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
this building wouldn't have been built
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
without fossil fuels and the evaluation
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
of the external externality cost to CO2
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
um there are Reams and reams of
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence that say that the
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
the benefits far outweigh the the cost
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
the perceived costs of that um like I
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
said if we want to have a broader
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
discussion on that I would be happy to
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
have it um to the other part of your
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
question with respect to commissions yes
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm skeptical of of of most
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
commissions because you know as somebody
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
who has been involved in government for
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
Going on 30 years I I find most
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
commissions to not really be worth the
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
time and effort they're mostly headline
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
Grabbers the and and the product for
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
most of them is is not something that
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
can be acted on now there are exceptions
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
to that rule uh but again I think my
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
testimony indicates I I am very
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
skeptical of the idea of a commission um
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
considering the the carbon tax doing
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
anything but promoting a carbon
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
tax okay thank you seeing no further
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you for whoops
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
there is one sorry representative
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
Swanson remember representative we're
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
here to elicit questions to obtain
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
information uh thank you Mr chair uh uh
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr sonunu for being here
 
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
uh just uh uh to follow up a little bit
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh you're concerned about the cost to
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of uh potential taxes I
 
00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.150 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of uh potential taxes I
believe

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
and of course you indicated opposition
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
to a commission to make a study but just
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh sort of honest uh from the standpoint
 
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.829 align:start position:0%
uh sort of honest uh from the standpoint
of

00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
dependence on external energy sources
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
and you said energy but I assume you
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
referring to carbon-based energy as far
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
as your cost factors if uh we do not do
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
something will uh as far as discouraging
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
or perhaps addressing the amount of
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
carbon-based fuels that the state
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
consumes uh will does that just further
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh the state of New Hampshire's
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
dependence on external sources because I
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that we produce any fossil
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
fuels internally from New Hampshire
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
except perhaps well I mean wood is not a
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel but it's a carbon based fuel
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
but uh would it further our dependence
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer that question
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
because it's not relevant to the in
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
front of us uh but but if you have a
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
quick answer I have a real quick answer
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
which is this is this is a broader
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
macroeconomics and and and I I would
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
argue that the the economic literature
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
over the last several hundred years
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
shows that um you know uh and I go I'll
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
go to Adam Smith that that references
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that economies grow and prosper
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
and create value when they are you they
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
are utilizing resources that they can't
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
obtain externally but can provide
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
provide value externally and by
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
obtaining cheap reliable resources of
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
energy in this state we can generate
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
value we can create opportunities we can
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
improve the lives of families and
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
businesses here um and economics says
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
that that is actually a good tradeoff
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
for those economies that that do look at
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
the free market and and and how it can
 
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.109 align:start position:0%
the free market and and and how it can
benefit

00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
them all right seeing no further
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you for your
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
testimony here this morning thank you
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
for the committee for giving me the
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity I've received a couple of
 
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:05.079 align:start position:0%
additional pink cards in the last few
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
minutes so I'm going to have to lower
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
the time limit from five minutes to four
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
minutes and call next on Barbara
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
Southard who is here she's from Bradford
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
and she's here representing herself good
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
morning Miss sou good morning and thank
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak today I really
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
what I want to say is that what we need
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
to do is start preparing for our
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
future it's and it's all about economics
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
really things that are happening in the
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
world today we can't control that but we
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
can prepare for it in the words of Ben
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
Franklin by failing to
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
fail so what is happening in the world
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm concerned about well starting
 
00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:03.550 align:start position:0%
that I'm concerned about well starting
in

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
2026 the EU will be imposing a tariff
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's a carbon border adjustment
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism we call cbam just for short
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
and this will be on carbon intensive
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
Imports that's like steel fertilizer
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
aluminum but lots of products will be
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
added to that as time goes on now
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
this has tremendous
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
implications and it's not because we
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
import all that much from the to the
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
export that much to the
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
EU but because other countries are going
 
00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:42.390 align:start position:0%
EU but because other countries are going
to

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
follow countries like uh well the UK is
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
planning to do it on in
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
2027 uh Canada's going to be following
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
and we do a lot to trade with them
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
Australia and many other countries
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
around the world will follow suit and
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
why would they do that because they
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay this tariff they don't
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
they want to they want to the money to
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
go to their own country and how do they
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
do that well if they have a carbon
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
price then they don't have to pay that
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
tariff well depends on how high their
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
carbon price is because what what um the
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
EU will do is it will
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
subtract what the
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
exporter has already paid in their own
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
country so there's a real advantage to
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
having a carbon price and shoot you
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
might as well have a border carbon T
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
attacks while you're doing that uh
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
and the thing is is that us Industries
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
are in a great position for this
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
because their products for example Steel
 
00:40:59.470 --> 00:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
which is one of the products that is
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
created in New Hampshire we have lots of
 
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.230 align:start position:0%
created in New Hampshire we have lots of
steel

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
steel
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
companies when when when they create
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
this they create it much more
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
cleanly and so their carbon emissions
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
per product is much smaller than other
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
countries it's like three times I mean
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
China's steel is like three times more
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh carbon intensive than ours so they're
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
at a what's called carbon
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
Advantage so what's going to happen is
 
00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
Industries are going to you know they're
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
going to start saying hey let's have a
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
carbon price and let's do a a border
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
carbon adjustment mechanism that's what
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to say it even though we
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
have Trump who's obviously not really
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
Pro this kind of thing he's build a
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
drill baby drill we know that but IND
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
Industries are going to say
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
hey we don't want to be paying all this
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
we want to do this domestically and this
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
is good for our
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
industry and so what I'm saying is that
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
prepare how exactly could we prepare
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot of things we could do
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh first of
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
all our Industries could start trying to
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
be more
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
efficient and they could start using
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and we could try to
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
make sure we we are using more
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
Renewables more solar more wind
 
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
certainly more wind we have a great
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
that and and businesses would really do
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
much better with that because they
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be paying all this uh this
 
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.150 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be paying all this uh this
carbon

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
fee and
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
when I'm talking about carbon could you
 
00:43:02.589 --> 00:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
wrap it up please thank you okay okay so
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
I really think that we need to provide
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
some leadership with some carbon I think
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
a carbon thean dividend right here in
 
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would be great we could
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
provide leadership to the United States
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they would follow suit I
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate you're listening anybody have
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you any
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing I want to thank you for
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
testifying this morning and I'm going to
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
call next on Dr Steven CLA from
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
Bedford to represent himself and give us
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
some testimony thank you we're down to
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
four minutes I might have to lower that
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
to three minutes if I keep getting a
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
dribble of pink cards here good
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for giving me the
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak um my name is Dr
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
Steven CLA I passed out my resume if
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see my credentials um I'm
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
currently retired from a long career as
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
a risk assessor evaluating impacts to
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
human and ecological Health my job was
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
essentially to determine the relative
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
risks of industrial Emissions on human
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
health and
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
Wildlife and my clients covered many
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
different industrial sectors and I
 
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
worked in many states with many types of
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
state and federal Regulatory Agencies as
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
I spoke to you last week I am here to
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
voice strong opposition to
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
hp36 which attempts to modify RSA 12a to
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
establish a commission to study the
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
short and long-term impacts of carbon
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
pricing mechanisms in New Hampshire I'm
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
an environmental scientist so I can
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
speak to the underlying causes and
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
effects that give rise to the perceived
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
economic losses that I believe will
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
ensue from what in my professional
 
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
judgment would be the irresponsible
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
formation of a commission to study a
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism to punitively put a price on
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
carbon an abundant element in our
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
periodic table that is obviously a
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
necessary building block for life on
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
this this Earth I can speak to what I
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
professionally conclude to be potential
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of this
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
fundamental fundamental Elemental
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
building block pricing carbon and its
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
many uh bonded forms cannot be measured
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
the argument for carbon pricing is
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
fundamentally flawed for the following
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
reasons the first fundamental flaw is
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the authors of this New Hampshire
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
Centric Bill endorsed the fantasy that
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
human effort can somehow put a dent in
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
the at necess budget for carbon dioxide
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire I
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
provided testimony last week on HB 106
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
which out outlined the futility of
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
ascribing carbon dioxide as a driving
 
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
variable uh for climate change let alone
 
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.190 align:start position:0%
variable uh for climate change let alone
the

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
senselessness of um trying to allocate
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
costs for this environmental charade
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to understand what a
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
minute portion of the atmosphere is
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
represented by carbon dioxide the answer
 
00:45:59.470 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
being 04 % that's up from the Baseline
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
of 0.3% over the last 50 years if we get
 
00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.710 align:start position:0%
of 0.3% over the last 50 years if we get
below

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
0.2% plant life will alarmingly die off
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
trying to sequester carbon and
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
subsequently estimate costs relating to
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
human activity is kind of like trying to
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
control the fly population by handing
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
out fly
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
swatters which is a good sayway to my
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
second point and that is the
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
distribution of carbon in and on the
 
00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:27.190 align:start position:0%
distribution of carbon in and on the
planet

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
planet
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
I just finished teaching my fourth grade
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
students about the carbon cycle as you
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
know we breathe in oxygen and breathe
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
out CO2 while plants breathe in CO2 and
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
breathe out
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
oxygen the plants turn the CO2 through
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
photosynthetic processes into cellulose
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
and Ox oxygen humans turn cellulose and
 
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
oxygen into
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
CO2 the balance between the two will
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
naturally shift based on the
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
distribution of of the two resulting in
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
a Greener Planet it is a known fact that
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
most of the us including New Hampshire
 
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
is markedly greener than it was a 100
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
years ago we don't need humans to
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
balance carbon in the atmosphere let
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
alone conjure credits at a as a hidden
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
existence tax on New Hampshire citizens
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
carbon sequestration in my professional
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
opinion is a Fool's errand and any
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
Associated Tax would also be foolishness
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
my third third and final point is to
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
highlight the unintended sources of
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
carbon however harmless they may be that
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
cancel out any efforts that the
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
suggested commissions may be attempting
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
to engineer at society's expense for
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
example the state of California has
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
spent Untold billions tearing down dams
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
which generate a lot of electricity by
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
the way to protect a small fish but as
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
we just witnessed the brush fueled fires
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
in Los Angeles that have resulted from a
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
host of mismanaged environmental
 
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
host of mismanaged environmental
programs

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
essentially cancel out Decades of
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
potential carbon credits by pumping
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
millions of tons of carbon into the
 
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
atmosphere uh I'll I'll just skip over
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
the last Point here I was talking about
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
um the senselessness of envir um EV
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
batteries and the fires at the EV EV
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
battery um facility last week that they
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
let burn uncontrolled for days uh and
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about trying to conserve
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
energy uh through that mechanism is
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
feudal and I'll just conclude that my
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
opposition to 306 is based on my
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
professional experiences spanning 30
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
years in the field of environmental
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
science which I would point out hasn't
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
seen one single prediction made to the
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
hyper politicized science scientific
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
consensus Builders come true I strongly
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
feel that any such commission would be a
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
house built on a foundation of shifting
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
sand which like California could be
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
washed away due to short-sighted
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory policies I thank you all uh
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to speak and I'll
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions okay thank you sir we
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nutter has
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
one thank you and thank you for your
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
testimony today could you tell me what
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
the difference is between the terms
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
fuels hydrocarbons cover anything or
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
organic anything with carbon in it is a
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
or carbon attached to another moyy is a
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbon a fossil fuel in my
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
definition is something uh that is
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
pulled out of the ground that was
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
originally generated from um decaying
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
fossils which would be coal gas oil that
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
type of
 
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.430 align:start position:0%
type of
thing

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
followup and thank you um for the
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up question um well we hear
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
carbon carbon carbon is it carbon or is
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
it carbon dioxide which is good for
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
plants uh well carbon dioxide I think is
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
is used as a
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
proxy uh for carbon credits and as I
 
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
testified last
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
week uh carbon
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
dioxide doesn't amount to a hill beans
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
as far as uh what affects any potential
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
Waring on this
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
planet I'm not sure that answers your
 
00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:34.109 align:start position:0%
planet I'm not sure that answers your
question

00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
but representative Kaplan has a question
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr K
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
for coming in this morning um Mr K
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
you're somebody who mentions quite a bit
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that you are a
 
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
professional that you you you mentioned
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
three times that you this is a
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
professional opinion of yours as a risk
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
assessor and so I find it quite curious
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
that you feel that it's futile to
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
measure measure the impacts of carbon in
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere which is a something
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
called the greenhouse effect which has
 
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
been studied since at least the 17th
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
century uh and also attribute um the
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
fires in California to mismanagement
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
which seems a controversial and
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
unscientific opinion and so my question
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
to you is do you how how do you how do
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
you account for the fact that the the
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
vast majority and the preponderance of
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence points to uh car in
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere is having you know an
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
impact on our climate uh do you do you
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a conspiracy or where do
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
where does the IP ttif you don't have to
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
answer that question uh we're not here
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
to have a broad discussion about climate
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
change we're here to discuss House Bill
 
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
306 which sets up a commission to study
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of carbon pricing so please
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
confine your questions I agree with you
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I I I pardon me if for for
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
broadening the question out but I felt
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
like the testimony we're hearing is is
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
wide ranging and wildly off base in
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
terms of this bill so I'm I'm just
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
trying to respond to the testimony that
 
00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
trying to respond to the testimony that
we

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
heard representative Vice chair Thomas
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair thanks
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I would like to
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
get back to the subject matter of this
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill and ask you given all of the
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
information that is available
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
from probably thousands of
 
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
sources what do you think this
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
commission could solve or come up with
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of the economic impact to the
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire given the subject
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
matter well as I testified last week I
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
think we are putting the cart in front
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the horse even even if you believe in
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
the whole greenhouse gas Paradigm we're
 
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
putting the car before the horse there's
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
no information to go on to create this
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
commission it's
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
premature representative McGee has a
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr Klo for being here with us today
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
um my question is whether you believe
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
that there are carbon markets cuz the
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
bill is about studying whether those
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
carbon markets are going to affect the
 
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
pricing of what people pay here in New
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for us to be better informed
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
so do you believe that we have climate
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh not climate not climate car carbon
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
markets well carbon markets exist but as
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
Mr cuno testified they don't work in my
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
public opinion in my own professional
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
opinion but we still have to deal with
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
them because they exist right
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't think you have to deal with
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
them the state of New Hampshire doesn't
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
have to deal with them you know I'm not
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
an economics professor I'm a scientist I
 
00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:52.839 align:start position:0%
deal with with the science so I I'm not
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
sure I can address your question but in
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
my own personal op opinion I don't think
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
that we need to deal with carbon markets
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
and carbon trading as a state to put an
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
to put an undo tax on the residents um
 
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
trying to manipulate the shenanigans
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
between different energy
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
Industries okay seeing no more questions
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh I want to thank you for your
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you and now we're going
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
to shift gears a little bit I'm going to
 
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
call on Megan Stone representing the new
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to give her to give
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
us her um interpretation of the
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
306 good morning um Miss Stone and
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
congratulations on your new job at the
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
department of energy thank you good
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
Megan Stone and I'm the legislative leaz
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
on with the Department of energy
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
um I will be extremely quick because I
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
did pass out a letter I partially just
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to introduce myself to you all um
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
the department of energy is neutral on
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
this bill um however should the
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee move forward uh we just ask
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
that uh you consider an amendment to add
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
the department as a member of the
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
commission uh given the roles given the
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
Department's role as a regulator and um
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
its statutory mandate to defend the
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
public interest um in the Pu filings
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
made by both electric distribution
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
companies and natural gas companies um
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
we just think that it would be important
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
to decl include the department and for
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
conversation great thank you very much
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
for thank you for that do we have a
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
question representative migy apparently
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
does I do because when I looked at this
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
bill I noticed that the commission uh
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
was seeking to complete its work by
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
November of
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
2025 and submit a report to the the
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
normal Suspects
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
I if the department were involved in
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
this when I first looked at that I
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
thought that there might be required a
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
longer time frame because oftentimes
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
these bills are not signed until the
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
summer so the question to you is um
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the um the description of
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
what the committee will consider would
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
the department think that that date for
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
a turnaround time on the report from the
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
commission be adequate in November um I
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
believe it should but let me get back to
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
you on that um I should get back to you
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
today on that okay thanks all right
 
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.549 align:start position:0%
today on that okay thanks all right
thank

00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%

00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you Miss Stone thank you
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
we look forward to uh future visits from
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
Reen who um didn't list her time
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
but Town rather but she's um here
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
to represent Mary Beth Raven is that
 
00:56:54.839 --> 00:56:57.029 align:start position:0%
to represent Mary Beth Raven is that
correct

00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%

copies um
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is from Mary Beth Raven my name is
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
Mary Beth Raven and I've had the
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
privilege of living in marac for over 30
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
years as residents of New Hampshire we
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
are all aware that misinformation can
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
spread easily whether through social
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
media news outlets or other sources in
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
this environment it's more important
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
than ever to ensure we have access to
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
clear balanced and reliable information
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
about important issues such as the
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
potential impact of carbon pricing
 
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.870 align:start position:0%
potential impact of carbon pricing
mechanisms

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
mechanisms
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
one approach to obtaining this
 
00:57:59.710 --> 00:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
information is to commission a
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan study we know from past
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
experience this that this is something
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
our community supports in 2020 I was
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
proud to help organize a warrant article
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
that was placed on the ballot in meramac
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
the article entitled New Hampshire
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
resolution to take action on climate
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
pollution called on both state and
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
federal elected officials to study
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing
 
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
mechanisms the overwhelming support for
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
this article article which passed with
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
2,152 votes in favor and
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
1,115 votes against shows that this
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
issue has broad backing in our town of
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
marac two of the members of the St St
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
committee Representatives n and Thomas
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
are from marac and I trust they will
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
honor their commitment to represent the
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
wishes of their constituents our town
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
has spoken and we want this study I
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
encourage all members of the commit to
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
support this initiative the cost would
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
be minimal primarily covering mileage
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for committee members the
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
value of this study however would be
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
significant it would provide us with
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
credible nonpartisan information that
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
can help us address an important
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
challenge in our state at the end of the
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
day this is about working together to
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
make informed decisions that benefit all
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
of us what do we stand to lose by coming
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
together for the greater
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
good um further note she had was 37
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
towns have already done cin
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
pricing and
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you from Mary Beth Raven as I
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
think um many people here probably know
 
00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
her I also wanted to say that I agree
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
with what she's saying and
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
from the years that I've been um
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
listening and and meeting some of the
 
00:59:57.789 --> 00:59:57.799 align:start position:0%
SDA members MERS I trust that you would
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
want to hear both sides and get as much
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
information you as you can to make a
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
good decision and hopefully you'll
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
listen to the
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
public may may I just make um for myself
 
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
something that was in today's conquered
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
monitor that I would like to share I
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
won't read it and I have a copy of one
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the Articles and I'll just mention
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
the other one it should only take a
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
minute is that okay go ahead quickly
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
please okay yes um today's conquered
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
monitor on the cover Granite geek whom
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
you may know going electric makes sense
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
with trash like with cars but who's
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
going to pay um I suggest that um you
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
read this it's very interesting I
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
learned from this as well that the
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
electric if you
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
if there's a gentleman in cbury who
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
sponsored a petition to spend $60,000
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
for electric trash compactor and it was
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
an easy and
 
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:04.839 align:start position:0%
cheap um and if and if that is can go
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
through then hopefully it'll be a good
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
role model for other things that'll work
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
um you can read this for yourself but
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
basically it's cheaper for them with the
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
electric when they're replacing to get
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
the electric trash compactor because it
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
saves them a lot of time and effort also
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
Al and money for the um okay thank you
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
for that the other one is I'll just read
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
you the title it's what will it take to
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
commit to a sustainable energy future
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
and it talks about the grid and how we
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
need some uh wind power at night because
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
that's when we can save the most on our
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
electricity so we won't have brown notes
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
or black notes Etc thank you for your
 
01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
off could we give that time to John
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
Gage if we have time we'll see um so
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose and representatives of
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
this committee I'm Susan Richmond thank
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
you for your time um before I do my I
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
think brief remarks I'd just like to
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
answer a couple comments um so Mr Vose
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
you chairman Vose you had mentioned does
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
this make a difference to municipalities
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
I'm on the uh trash advisory committee
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
in Durham and in fact yes it does we
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
needed to buy new garbage trucks which
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
are hugely expensive and um were
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
planning to get diesel and then did
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
further study and realized looking at
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
projections of what costs would be it
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
made more sense to get an EV trash uh
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
trash truck garbage truck and actually
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't get two we were hoping to get
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
two when we realized that logistically
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
it would be hard to recharge so that was
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
not just an ideological gohle hog it was
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
it was really a considered opinion so I
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
believe that any kind of uh knowing
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of carbon pricing
 
01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
helps with any municipal or government
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
procurement and with business decision
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
so it's just a wise piece of information
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
also um as regarding uh representative
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
Harrington you'd asked why are we even
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
looking at this given the direction that
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
the Trump administration's going in my
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
understanding is Elon Musk actually is
 
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:52.839 align:start position:0%
in favor of carbon pricing and you know
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
who knows what's going to happen with
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
tariffs worldwide but up until this
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
moment Europe had been planning and
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
Canada to put that carbon border
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment on our products so again it
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
would affect business in the us if we
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
had a kind of Border carbon adjustment
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
and that's a complicated concept so
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank goodness there could be a study of
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
that uh last comment um the presumption
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
from Michael sonunu that any carbon fee
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
automatically is robbing ing customers
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
is bizarre because in so many places
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
that carbon fee whatever money is
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
collected is just turned around and
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
return to households and it's simply a
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
matter of how you set up the bill it is
 
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
not pre-ordained um ideally what I've
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
heard in the United States is that any
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
kind of carbon fee would be Revenue
 
01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
neutral that enough would be taken off
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
to pay the administrative fees about 5
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
1% to 5% um you know more the first
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
couple years and then and then nothing
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
and then households would get money back
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
and so that has been the experience in
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
Canada I'm not sure that uh Trudeau
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
stepping down is entirely the story of
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
what happened with carbon fee in Canada
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that a Canadian
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing system which has been in
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
place for six years uh under that their
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
economy has increased 80% of Canadians
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
receive more in climate action
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
incentives than they pay an increased
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
energy cost and their increased
 
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:26.839 align:start position:0%
disposable income then then contributes
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
to a rising GNP and at the same time
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions have decreased so
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's an organization called Regional
 
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
economic modeling Inc or Remy for short
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
they've provided analysis to both
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
governmental bodies and to fossil fuel
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
corporations so they're they are
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
politically IDE ideologically neutral
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
and Remy conducted a study on the effect
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
of a revenue neutral carbon price on the
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
American economy in other words it would
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
cost the government nothing and and and
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
that same kind of giving the money back
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
to households Remy's analysis found no
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
economic argument against fee and
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
dividend it creates jobs grows the
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
economy saves lives and makes Americans
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
richer so I'm sharing with you graphs
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
showing increase in family income which
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
results in the addition of 2.8 million
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
jobs over nine years because suddenly
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
people can afford
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
healthare um because that's where most
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
of the money ends up and that's where
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
most of the new jobs are an increase in
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
national GDP and then the avoidance of
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
230,000 premature deaths due to
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
reduction in air pollutants that often
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
accompany emissions so you'll see all
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
those graphs and the stuff that I am
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
handing you and um I gave representative
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh statement from a number of uh
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
I think over 3,000 worldwide economists
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
of both parties um supporting this as a
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
economically viable and practical
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
solution thanks so much for your time
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you any questions
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
for Miss
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
Richmond seeing none we'll turn to the
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
last speaker of the day and that is Mr
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
John Gage of Windam representing himself
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
and Mr Gage you have four
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
minutes we get four more minutes
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
from no we have uh a caucus that we need
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
to get to so four minutes we'll have to
 
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:33.789 align:start position:0%
to get to so four minutes we'll have to
do

01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what I'll compromise and
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
give you five how's that thank you thank
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
you so much chairman Bose and thank you
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
today I'm John Gage I'm testifying on
 
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself today but I am the
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
state coordinator of citizens climate
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
Lobby in New Hampshire a national
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization that's working
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
to create the political will to enable
 
01:07:58.829 --> 01:07:58.839 align:start position:0%
Congress to pass carbon fee and dividend
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
legislation but that's not what we're
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
talking about here today however it is
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
what gives me a lot of experience I've
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
been a volunteer for nine years I left
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
my job six years ago to volunteer
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
full-time uh so I've studied this
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
subject I've been in Congress um
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
lobbying for carbon feing dividend over
 
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
60 times and I want to share what I've
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
learned as a citizen volunteer uh for
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
federal carbon pricing to help my state
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
prepare for what I think is inevitable
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing is spreading around the
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
world it's tripled in the last 12 or 15
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
years um prices are rising the EU has
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
price has tripled in the last 10 years
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
or so um and Canada is rising um their
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
carbon fee and dividend bill is
 
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
increasing by $15 per ton a year which
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
is why it's going up it's going up to
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
send a stronger and stronger price
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
signal most of the money 90% is going
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
back to households and 80% of the
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
families are coming out
 
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
families are coming out
ahead

01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
so what is New Hampshire doing given
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
that carbon
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
pricing now covers 24% of global fossil
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
fuel production um countries prices are
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
rising and Border carbon adjustments are
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
starting next year I checked Ai and it
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
said no the EU carbon border adjustment
 
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
is not put on hold it's only in phase
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
one right now which is on paper um the
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
countries exporters of free polluting
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
countries have to calculate on paper
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
what their carbon emissions are and what
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
it would cost at the border um to put
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
products into the EU Marketplace the
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
price starts in 2026 January us
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
exporters of car of Steel aluminum
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
cement Plastics will start paying the EU
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
carbon price next year
 
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
the UK starts the following year Japan
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
after that Australia and Canada are
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
looking at it the United States is the
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
only developed country in the world that
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a carbon
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
price uh so we're not a leader in this
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
um but this is what is the most coste
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
effective way to incentivize investment
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
and innovation in a clean energy world
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
if we want to lead the country like we
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
did in space and computers and the
 
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
internet uh we need a market that in
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
corporate Ates the cost of polluting
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
into the price of goods so that we get
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
an efficient market and investors and
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
businesses can make fully informed
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
decisions how can the state make fully
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
informed decisions we can anticipate a
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
future carbon price today that's what
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
this commit that's what this study um is
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
for check out the likelihood of a
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
federal carbon price about when we
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
expect it to start about when what price
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
we expect these are all things that you
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
know if you live in the carbon world
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
that I I in inhabit and when we're
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
making State decisions about how should
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
we heat our state buildings what should
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
we use for transportation we don't have
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
to ban anything but we should anticipate
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
a price on pollution in the future when
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
we're buying something that's going to
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
be in service for 20 or 40 years um
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise when there is a federal carbon
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
price we will find that we're stuck with
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
strained assets which would have been
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
prevented but they are preventable right
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
now um and this study is how to do that
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
simply asking please take a look at
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
let's evaluate the likelihood of a
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
carbon price the impacts on New
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and steps we can take here to
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
do proper risk management um it might
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
not be 100% chance but businesses
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
hundreds of businesses and some states
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
are already doing this anticipating a
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
future carbon price and the decisions
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
they're making now um to be strategic to
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
save taxpayer dollars uh and somebody
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
asked what can we do about businesses um
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
they're probably not paying attention to
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
Global carbon markets um the state can
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
let them you know inform them this study
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
can be a blueprint here's what we know
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
what's going on we've checked it out
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
we've had the Bia and clean energy New
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and legislators from both
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
parties and we've looked at the World
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
Bank State and trends of carbon pricing
 
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
report we've looked at what's going on
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
in Congress um we've thought about how
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
we manage our state and this is a this
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
is our best advice for properly handling
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh the potential for a federal carbon
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
price in New
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank you questions for
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
Mr Gage
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Gage for being here um you said that
 
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
uh carbon pricing is the most effect
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
cost effective way to reduce carbon and
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
I know that citizens climate Lobby is
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
very big on that mechanism um what's the
 
01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
basis for that uh opinion yeah sure
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
there was a recent uh study that looked
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
at all of the countries
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh their their climate policies uh and
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
many of them did not produce very much
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
results the successful countries uh in
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
reducing emissions were the ones that
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
had carbon pricing included in their
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
policy mix uh I can forward you that
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
report after this meeting um but it's
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
not only the most cost effective it is
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
very powerful and there was a question
 
01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
about whether carbon pric works it
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
depends on the price obviously if you
 
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
know Reggie had a price of $5 per ton of
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
CO2 for 10 years that's not a
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
significant price signal to drive change
 
01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
um if when Reggie went in they had
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
instead done a carbon fee in dividend
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
which Rises by $10 per ton of CO2 a year
 
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
we would have a carbon price of $100 per
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
ton now which is a significant price
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
signal which is more than the EU or
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
Canada has and The Bu the coal plant and
 
01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
bow would have been stopped 5 years ago
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
because it would have been uncompetitive
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
in providing electricity to the grid um
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
so it is the most powerful cost
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
effective and efficient and
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
comprehensive because it instead of
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
picking one particular technology or um
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
regulation to impose it simply sends a
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
price signal through the whole economy
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
um but that's you know it works the main
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
point though is it's happening spreading
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
and and us exporters are going to start
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
paying it to more and more countries so
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
this commission the study commission is
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
to say look we're probably going to end
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
up paying a carbon price at some point
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
what should we do now um to to make the
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
best of you know to do risk assessment
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
but make the best of it if it happens U
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
we know what those things are but we
 
01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
could produce a report and advise our
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
businesses our our state leaders um
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
share information that is really
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
fundamental to managing the economy of
 
01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.750 align:start position:0%
fundamental to managing the economy of
New

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Gage for being here um you know not
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
withstanding what you just said about
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
Reggie and the the
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
low $5 per ton price that it started out
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
with we we had testimony and were given
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
graphs last week by folks from the
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
utilities and and the iso New England
 
01:16:05.629 --> 01:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
that showed over the last 15 years since
 
01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
the Advent of regie
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
that um the much
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
lower carbon fuel natural gas fired
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
power plants have steadily gained market
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
share uh in the regions uh in the region
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
and that the coal and oil fired power
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
plants have essentially been driven out
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
do you think that that is a do you think
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
that Reggie is a
 
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh good demonstration of the power of
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
subtle even subtle price signals to
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
change uh the carbon intensity of an of
 
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
an economy I do it was a good Regional
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
or you know Regional effort uh the
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
problem with um pricing carbon at a
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
state or Regional level is you can't do
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
the Border carbon adjustment
 
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
and so your businesses um have a
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage uh in the cost
 
01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
of production and energy generally oh uh
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
I heard earlier somebody said a carbon
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
tax is a tax on energy that is
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
completely wrong that's a fossil fuel
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
talking point a carbon fee is a polluter
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
fee so those energy sources that don't
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
pollute carbon don't pay the fee um it's
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
a it's a fee on polluters it's not a tax
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
on energy
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh that is a tactic that we keep hearing
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
over and over again to scare us from
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
doing something that would not be good
 
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
for the fossil fuel industry but this is
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
in our best interest I just wanted to
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
mention there's a two-face game the
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry plays the first
 
01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
handout that I gave you uh is a list of
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
quotes from websites today from fossil
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
fuel producers oil and gas uh saying we
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
accept the science of climate change
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
from our pollution and we support carbon
 
01:17:59.070 --> 01:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
pricing because it's the economist gold
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
pollution representative Kaplan has a
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
question yes uh thank you Mr chair and
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Gage for coming in again
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
this morning uh I actually have a
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
two-part question the first one is a
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
simple yes or no do you find it uh as
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
interesting as I do that this uh carbon
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
pricing mechanism was originally a
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
republican idea based on on the
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
principle that the market should be uh
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
the deciding factor in in determining
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
our our Energy Mix and secondly what do
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
you account how do you account for the
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
fact that it's become such a partisan
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
issue okay the first part right James
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
Baker and George Schultz came out with a
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
um a steadily Rising carbon fee reate
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
all the money back to households and use
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
a border adjustment to um protect us
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
producers as well as hold other
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh free polluting countries accountable
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
so yes I do think that's important to
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
note this is a business-friendly
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
conservative approach that we're trying
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
to get Congress to do um from the state
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
perspective however carbon pricing
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
happens is tough to say uh the treasury
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
secretary nominee of President Trump is
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
Mr Gage Scot thank you I appreciate you
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
answering that question but it's not
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
directly related to the subject of the
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill what was the second which is a
 
01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.470 align:start position:0%
bill what was the second which is a
study

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
commission uh which is determined to be
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
quite expensive so representative McGee
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
how about the second part of my question
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
could he try to answer that I mean was
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
there a second part there was yeah go
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
ahead how do you account for the fact
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
that a carbon pricing mechanism has
 
01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
become so politicized and so
 
01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
partisan yeah that has nothing to do
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
with the bill I can just say I don't
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
think we need to discuss that
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGee do you have a
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
question that's relevant to the bill I
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
do thank thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr Gage for coming out again um from
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony and also from what you've
 
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
presented here uh would you be able to
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
answer the question of whether you think
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
there is a need for us it seems like
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
there are lots of questions and also
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
lots of opinions from people about uh
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
what we could and couldn't be doing
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
should and shouldn't be doing but what
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
it leads me to believe is that we don't
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
have uh we don't have enough answers
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
amongst us here in order to be doing the
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
business of the state which is making
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
decisions around things like pricing for
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's RPS pricing or um or Reggie
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
pricing that type of thing we can't
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
really participate in those debates and
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
we can't be making good decisions if we
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
don't have more information than we do
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
today would you agree with
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
that yes I agree um there are some good
 
01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
bills this okay you answered the
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your your being here and
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's time to move on we have
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
other business to conduct we all need to
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
be back here at 1:00 for another public
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm going to close the public
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
306 and encourage you to enjoy your
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
lunch and we'll see you at 1:00 Mr
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
chairman can we get the blue sheet and
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
online numbers please yes the online
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
number is support 111 oppose live and
 
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280 align:start position:0%

02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay time to resume our activity here
 
02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
02:33:36.190 --> 02:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon science technology and energy
 
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%

02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we've had had that issue in
 
02:33:50.479 --> 02:33:51.230 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we've had had that issue in
the

02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
past and I don't remember what we did
 
02:33:56.349 --> 02:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
about it do you
 
02:34:00.510 --> 02:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
remember yeah I mean if you put it back
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
further that would help but then last
 
02:34:04.990 --> 02:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
year or last term you told me we weren't
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to touch
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.150 --> 02:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
true all right we're going to have to
 
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
live with it for now yeah okay all right
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
let's get started here so so we are uh
 
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
I've just opened a public hearing on
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 95- FN requiring the New
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op to regularly
 
02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
file a certificate of deregulation with
 
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission and I
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
want to call on the prime sponsor of the
 
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill representative Wendy Thomas to
 
02:34:41.790 --> 02:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill to
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
02:34:47.950 --> 02:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
record I am Wendy Thomas and I represent
 
02:34:49.950 --> 02:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
the town of marac and I'm here to
 
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
995 first a certificate of deregulation
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
is a formal document or legal
 
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement issued by a governing
 
02:35:02.469 --> 02:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
Authority that signifies an entity such
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
as an electric utility or cooperative
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
operates under a deregulated framework
 
02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the context of electricity markets it
 
02:35:13.830 --> 02:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
typically means the utility or
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
cooperative is not bound by certain
 
02:35:18.750 --> 02:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements such as price
 
02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
controls or service obligations that
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
apply to fully regulated entities
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
instead it may function in a competitive
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
market place allowing customers more
 
02:35:31.469 --> 02:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
choice and
 
02:35:34.389 --> 02:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
flexibility the last time the New
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op filed a
 
02:35:39.550 --> 02:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
certificate of deregulation was 24 years
 
02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
ago requiring the New Hampshire uh Co-op
 
02:35:45.790 --> 02:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
to file a certificate of deregulation
 
02:35:48.030 --> 02:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
every 3 years could be beneficial for
 
02:35:50.590 --> 02:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
its members for several reasons
 
02:35:52.590 --> 02:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
filing a certificate ensures that the
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative regularly reviews its
 
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory status and communicates its
 
02:35:59.550 --> 02:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
operational choices to members this
 
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
promotes transparency allowing members
 
02:36:04.349 --> 02:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
to understand how decisions align with
 
02:36:07.269 --> 02:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
their interests being unregulated has
 
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
served the co-op well and while I don't
 
02:36:12.269 --> 02:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate any change to that status the
 
02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
members have a right to be heard with
 
02:36:16.269 --> 02:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
regard to the direction that the co-op
 
02:36:16.279 --> 02:36:17.309 align:start position:0%
regard to the direction that the co-op
is

02:36:17.309 --> 02:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
heading as a cooperative
 
02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
NHC is member owned regularly filing
 
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
this certificate ensures that the
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
leadership remains accountable to its
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
members by providing them with
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
consistent updates on the organization's
 
02:36:34.030 --> 02:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
structure and Regulatory
 
02:36:36.110 --> 02:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
alignment electric markets and
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
regulations evolve over time a trienal
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
review and filing process encourag The
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
Cooperative to reassess whether
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
deregulation continues to be the best
 
02:36:48.910 --> 02:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
approach for its members given given
 
02:36:50.670 --> 02:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
current mark market
 
02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
conditions the filing process could
 
02:36:55.230 --> 02:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
include member consultations giving
 
02:36:57.630 --> 02:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
members a say in whether deregulation
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
aligns with their needs this strengthens
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
Democratic participa participation
 
02:37:03.630 --> 02:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
within the
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
Cooperative by mandating regular reviews
 
02:37:08.630 --> 02:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
the bill ensures that the co-op is not
 
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
locked into a regulatory model that
 
02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
could that may no longer serve its
 
02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
members best interests providing a
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
safeguard against decisions that could
 
02:37:19.230 --> 02:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
negatively impact rates or service

energy storage and grid Technologies The
 
02:37:28.590 --> 02:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
Cooperative must adapt to maintain
 
02:37:30.269 --> 02:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
affordability and
 
02:37:32.830 --> 02:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
reliability requiring periodic
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
re-evaluation ensures the cooperative's
 
02:37:37.510 --> 02:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework remains suitable
 
02:37:39.550 --> 02:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
for the evolving energy
 
02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
landscape the recurring requirement
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
promotes a culture of long-term planning
 
02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
and strategic thinking within the
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative benefiting members by
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
fostering consistent efforts to optimize
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
operations and costs this is not in any
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
way a punitive request instead it is a
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
transparency request so that all Co-op
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
members can remain on the same page by
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill members and
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders excuse me ensure that the
 
02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
Cooperative remains aligned with its
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
mission to provide reliable and
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
affordable electricity while adapting to
 
02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
the needs of its membership andk Market
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
changes thank you and I'll take any
 
02:38:25.630 --> 02:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative one
 
02:38:27.150 --> 02:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
quick question are you a member of the
 
02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
co-op I am not okay thank you uh
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Thomas has a
 
02:38:34.349 --> 02:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chair
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh did
 
02:38:38.670 --> 02:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
the new did the New England Co-op
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
request this bill no
 
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
no follow follow up and is there an
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
issue that you disc discovered that
 
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
resulted in this bill being required to
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
submit for some maybe some unknown issue
 
02:38:59.309 --> 02:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
that didn't exist or you weren't aware
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
of um the idea for the bill came from a
 
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
a column that was written by our
 
02:39:07.990 --> 02:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate uh identifying that
 
02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
the last time the regulations uh had
 
02:39:14.910 --> 02:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
been filed were 24 years ago and there
 
02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
there was a little bump with the uh the
 
02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
board members uh either last year or the
 
02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:20.990 align:start position:0%
board members uh either last year or the
year

02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:39:23.309 --> 02:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
before representative McGee has a
 
02:39:25.150 --> 02:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question my question
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
is around the cycle for three years if
 
02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
there's a reason for that or if uh it
 
02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
could be you know five years or how' you
 
02:39:38.590 --> 02:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
come up with three hey Google what's the
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
average uh term of a board member so
 
02:39:44.429 --> 02:39:44.439 align:start position:0%
three years is the average term of a
 
02:39:46.469 --> 02:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
board member across the board I mean
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
across the board that was I didn't mean
 
02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
um that's the average term and so that's
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
why um that's why that that uh time
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
there all right seeing no more questions
 
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
we want to thank you representative for
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation next we'll
 
02:40:07.950 --> 02:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
hear from the New Hampshire Electric
 
02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
Co-op and I'll call Mr Michael Jennings
 
02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:16.880 align:start position:0%

02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
co-ops regulatory
 
02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh regime and William Darcy who is the
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board of the co-op so
 
02:40:29.389 --> 02:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
Gentlemen please let us know what you
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you chairman Vose and
 
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the House science
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee I am
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
Michael Jennings I am the interum
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
president and CEO and with me today I
 
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
have William Darcy the chair of of our
 
02:40:53.389 --> 02:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
board of directors I am here today to
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
testify an opposition of House Bill
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
95 so the New Hampshire Electric
 
02:41:02.429 --> 02:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
Cooperative opposes House Bill 95
 
02:41:05.710 --> 02:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
because we see it as unnecessary and it
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
could add additional costs to both rate
 
02:41:11.230 --> 02:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
payers and members of The
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
Cooperative as we discussed last week
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
NHC is different than the other
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
utilities we were founded in 1939 to
 
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
provide electric service to the most
 
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
Rural and underserved parts of New
 
02:41:26.469 --> 02:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the for-profit utilities
 
02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't serve so we're a nonprofit that
 
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
is democratically controlled by its
 
02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
members who directly elect our board of
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
directors our members are the owners of
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
the system and we in return return
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
operating margins to our membership in
 
02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
the form of capital credits as a
 
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
Cooperative we exist to meet the needs
 
02:41:52.510 --> 02:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
needs of our members and as a result New
 
02:41:54.910 --> 02:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Broadband LLC is the
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
for-profit wholly owned subsidiary we
 
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
created in 2020 in direct response to
 
02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:01.110 align:start position:0%
created in 2020 in direct response to
that

02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
membership we oppose House Bill 95 for
 
02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
the following reasons firstly that the
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire Electric
 
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative already possess the ability
 
02:42:14.269 --> 02:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
to choose whether or not to be
 
02:42:17.469 --> 02:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
regulated members of NHC affirmed their
 
02:42:20.309 --> 02:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
desire to be deregulated in une 2000 and
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
currently possess the authority as
 
02:42:24.670 --> 02:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
democratically controlled organization
 
02:42:26.910 --> 02:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
to reaffirm that choice or choose
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise via bylaw petition during our
 
02:42:30.359 --> 02:42:31.870 align:start position:0%
otherwise via bylaw petition during our
annual

02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
annual
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
election secondly it's important to
 
02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
remember that our members overwhelmingly
 
02:42:41.309 --> 02:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
supported our deregulation so NHC exists
 
02:42:43.309 --> 02:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
to serve its members who have been very
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
clear about their views on this issue
 
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
when this issue was last raised at our
 
02:42:51.790 --> 02:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
annual meeting and 2000 nearly 95% of
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
the membership voted to stay or to
 
02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:56.510 align:start position:0%
the membership voted to stay or to
become

02:42:56.510 --> 02:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:42:58.510 --> 02:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
deregulated also the proposed
 
02:43:00.429 --> 02:43:00.439 align:start position:0%
legislation could cost New Hampshire
 
02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
$65,000 if the Cooperative failed to
 
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
file that certificate of deregulation
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would make NHC subject to
 
02:43:15.309 --> 02:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
regulation by the p and the Pu estimates
 
02:43:17.389 --> 02:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
it would cost an additional
 
02:43:20.670 --> 02:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
$65,000 to hire addition staff to meet
 
02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:21.710 align:start position:0%
$65,000 to hire addition staff to meet
this

02:43:21.710 --> 02:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
obligation if the Cooperative filed a
 
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
certificate of
 
02:43:28.590 --> 02:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
deregulation it would add costs to
 
02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
members in terms of the annual election
 
02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
as well so in order to reaffirm the
 
02:43:36.150 --> 02:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
certificate a deregulation The
 
02:43:37.469 --> 02:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
Cooperative would need to spend
 
02:43:39.710 --> 02:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
additional money and encourage a super
 
02:43:41.870 --> 02:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
majority vote of its members at an
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
election every three years these costs
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
would unfortunately be borne by members
 
02:43:51.070 --> 02:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
it would also increase costs to The
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
Cooperative members if we became
 
02:43:58.910 --> 02:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Pu the
 
02:44:02.750 --> 02:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
$65,000 was related to the Pu costs the
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Electric Cooperative would
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
also have to hire additional staff at a
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
very considerable cost as well to work
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
with the Public Utilities Commission a
 
02:44:15.230 --> 02:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
cost that would also have to be born by
 
02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
the members of the
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative and lastly ulation by the Pu
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
would stifle the ability of the
 
02:44:25.550 --> 02:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative to be responsive to its
 
02:44:29.110 --> 02:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
members and HC has demonstrated numerous
 
02:44:31.469 --> 02:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
times over the years an ability to be
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
nimble and Innovative on a variety of
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
matters including power purchases time
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
of day use rates by members and New
 
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Broadband regulation by the Pu
 
02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
would hamper this ability to be
 
02:44:49.389 --> 02:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
Innovative and flexible the decision to
 
02:44:52.590 --> 02:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
provide Broadband is just another
 
02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
example of how the Cooperative has been
 
02:44:57.790 --> 02:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
Innovative over the years since most
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
regulated Electric utilities have not
 
02:45:03.389 --> 02:45:03.399 align:start position:0%
even stepped foot into that
 
02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
business and I will hand it over to uh
 
02:45:12.990 --> 02:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:16.030 --> 02:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you chairman V and members of
 
02:45:19.349 --> 02:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm the chair of the New
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Cooperative I'm also
 
02:45:24.030 --> 02:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
chair of their Broadband subsidiary New
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Broadband I've never appeared
 
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
before you so I want to give you a
 
02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
little introduction in addition to those
 
02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
positions I'm chair of the town of
 
02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
Benton's Board of Selectmen uh most
 
02:45:39.190 --> 02:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
people don't know where Benton is it's
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
so small that we don't even have a staff
 
02:45:45.469 --> 02:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm also the defacto town manager uh
 
02:45:47.230 --> 02:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
most people don't know where it is but
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
hikers do because it's the home of Mount
 
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
musak uh which is the Western most 4,000
 
02:45:56.309 --> 02:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
footer in uh New
 
02:45:59.070 --> 02:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I wanted to supplement uh
 
02:46:02.309 --> 02:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
Mike's testimony uh which has most of
 
02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
the points by uh pointing out a number
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
of things about uh uh about this but I
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
did want to go back I I do have some
 
02:46:13.309 --> 02:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory background back in Conneticut
 
02:46:16.110 --> 02:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
where I came I was a consumer advocate
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
for a number of years under a odd
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
statute that had me representing only
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
electric and telec Communications uh um
 
02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
customers I then became director of
 
02:46:29.309 --> 02:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
regulation for the Connecticut pu in
 
02:46:32.190 --> 02:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
charge of electric telephone water and
 
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
gas customers the important thing about
 
02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:37.030 align:start position:0%
gas customers the important thing about
uh

02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
regulation is I think and one of the
 
02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences is it
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh Mike noted Broadband uh in 200
 
02:46:54.110 --> 02:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
20 uh the members by petition it was not
 
02:46:55.950 --> 02:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
did not come from the board of directors
 
02:46:58.830 --> 02:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
did not come from staff uh said we want
 
02:47:02.190 --> 02:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
to do Broadband uh uh we want you to do
 
02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
broadband and provide it uh to members
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh what happened is uh the that passed
 
02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh with a 64% vote of members the very
 
02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
next meeting of the board of directors
 
02:47:17.389 --> 02:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
after that
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
election uh
 
02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
the board decided to uh obey the will of
 
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
the members and to get into the
 
02:47:27.150 --> 02:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
Broadband business which was fortuitous
 
02:47:29.710 --> 02:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
because that was the month that Governor
 
02:47:32.830 --> 02:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
cunu uh issued an
 
02:47:36.630 --> 02:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh for uh grants under what
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
is called the cares program uh the catch
 
02:47:42.349 --> 02:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
was they had to spend the money uh by
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the year uh so very few
 
02:47:47.830 --> 02:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
people actually stepped up to the bar uh
 
02:47:53.590 --> 02:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
NHC did do that but if we were regulated
 
02:47:56.469 --> 02:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
never would have happened uh because you
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
would have had to go to the Pu start a
 
02:48:03.550 --> 02:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
proceeding to be able to uh get an
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
authorization to get into this new risky
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
competitive area and it never would have
 
02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
happened and that Grant in our
 
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
successful execution of that Grant is
 
02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
successful execution of that Grant is
why

02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh NHC is now providing service to
 
02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of broadband customers
 
02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
including myself in towns which had no
 
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
chance of getting a cable company or
 
02:48:33.309 --> 02:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
anybody else to be able to provide that
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
service to them uh and we would not have
 
02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
even gotten the grants that we got we
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
got federal grants we got northern
 
02:48:44.030 --> 02:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
border Grant we got a $50 million uh
 
02:48:47.389 --> 02:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
Grant from uh Bea it never would have
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
happened unless we established our
 
02:48:53.389 --> 02:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
credentials our ability to build execute
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
and service and provide service so
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of the UN unanticipated
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of Regulation that never
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
would have happened another one that
 
02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
that members may may recall that a
 
02:49:11.710 --> 02:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
couple years ago when Energy prices
 
02:49:14.349 --> 02:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
spiked uh people looked around and they
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
and they saw that NHC actually had lower
 
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
rates than the regular utilities so it
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
started an examination well why could
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
this be well what was revealed is there
 
02:49:29.830 --> 02:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
we did things differently in two uh
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
important respects uh one is that we had
 
02:49:36.030 --> 02:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
more Market exposure something that none
 
02:49:38.030 --> 02:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the other utilities had because they
 
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
were they were fixed in a sixth month
 
02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
going out to bid with what's called ibts
 
02:49:46.550 --> 02:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
but they're energy marketers we did that
 
02:49:50.030 --> 02:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
for for most of our our as well but we
 
02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
had a a considerable Taste of the of the
 
02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
market and that caused to to suppress
 
02:50:01.070 --> 02:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
the the race the other thing we did was
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
we had some longer term and Midterm
 
02:50:06.110 --> 02:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
contracts some people refer to that as
 
02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
ladin but the combination of that
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
especially when rates are spiking is you
 
02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
entered into those earlier contracts
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
when rates weren't so high so that had
 
02:50:18.910 --> 02:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
an effect on moderating our rates as
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
well so I bring that up only because
 
02:50:24.429 --> 02:50:24.439 align:start position:0%
it's an example if we were regulated we
 
02:50:25.950 --> 02:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
would have been doing things the way
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
ever source unitel and Liberty uh was
 
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
doing it because we weren't regulated we
 
02:50:32.469 --> 02:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
were able to find a different way and
 
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
therefore serve as an example to the
 
02:50:39.110 --> 02:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
other Utilities in the puc we've also
 
02:50:41.389 --> 02:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
had Innovations in other areas we were
 
02:50:43.309 --> 02:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
the first ones in in New Hampshire to
 
02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
have Smart Meters Ami we've done some
 
02:50:49.389 --> 02:50:49.399 align:start position:0%
pilot programs in in various areas some
 
02:50:52.110 --> 02:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
success some failures but again it
 
02:50:55.870 --> 02:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
provides a an area to to look at and say
 
02:50:57.389 --> 02:50:57.399 align:start position:0%
you know maybe they did it right maybe
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
they not maybe we ought to look at it so
 
02:51:02.190 --> 02:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
I think it provides it's valuable that
 
02:51:04.590 --> 02:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
we be deregulated and provide those
 
02:51:07.349 --> 02:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
benefits I think to all of New Hampshire
 
02:51:07.359 --> 02:51:09.349 align:start position:0%
benefits I think to all of New Hampshire
thank

02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:51:12.670 --> 02:51:12.680 align:start position:0%

this I'm trying to figure out it seems
 
02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
as if there's a solution that's trying
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
to find a problem is there anything that
 
02:51:30.630 --> 02:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow you to do or not
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
to do that you couldn't already do now
 
02:51:34.910 --> 02:51:34.920 align:start position:0%

um in a in in a lot but not all of your
 
02:52:00.990 --> 02:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
testimony but a lot of your
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
testimonies seemed to be
 
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
discussing this bill as if it
 
02:52:13.190 --> 02:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
contains a requirement as if
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to require that you become a
 
02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
regulated utility which you're not not
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
now I should have I wanted to preface my
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
remarks by saying I'm a real I'm a big
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
admirer of the the Electric Cooperative
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
um everything that that you guys do uh
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
not the least of which uh in a previous
 
02:52:36.590 --> 02:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
professional life I worked with the New
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh one of your biggest
 
02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
customers the North Conway water
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
Precinct to uh install that megawatt of
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
solar and I was impressed all along in
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
terms of how they were working with you
 
02:52:52.830 --> 02:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
policies that made that possible anyway
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say I'm an admirer of
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
the co-op but a lot of your testimony
 
02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
was speaking as if this bill was going
 
02:53:03.550 --> 02:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
to be requiring you to become regulated
 
02:53:05.510 --> 02:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh and it's not I mean I plain reading
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill says that it would require
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
you to go through a process to
 
02:53:10.319 --> 02:53:12.389 align:start position:0%
you to go through a process to
essentially

02:53:12.389 --> 02:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh discuss certify why you should
 
02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be unregulated so in that
 
02:53:21.309 --> 02:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
vein is wouldn't it be possible for you
 
02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
to look at a requirement like this and
 
02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps the
 
02:53:30.110 --> 02:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
period the time period could be changed
 
02:53:31.389 --> 02:53:31.399 align:start position:0%
so that it wasn't three years maybe
 
02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
every five years uh wouldn't it provide
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
you an opportunity to essentially brag
 
02:53:38.399 --> 02:53:39.150 align:start position:0%
you an opportunity to essentially brag
on

02:53:39.150 --> 02:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
yourself and describe not only for your
 
02:53:46.349 --> 02:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
members but for the state as a whole uh
 
02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
why being unregulated ated and operating
 
02:53:52.830 --> 02:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
as a Cooperative allows you to do many
 
02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
of the things you just talked about be
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
Innovative you
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
know um ladder your your supply
 
02:54:04.670 --> 02:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
contracts have Smart Meters offer your
 
02:54:07.150 --> 02:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
customers time of use rates all those
 
02:54:08.990 --> 02:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
things that the our
 
02:54:11.790 --> 02:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
regulated friends don't seem to be able
 
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
to do uh you could dis you could brag on
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
yourselves every five years and help
 
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
inform not just like I said you're
 
02:54:20.990 --> 02:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
members but uh the whole state this
 
02:54:23.309 --> 02:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh the advantages that you
 
02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
that you enjoy and the benefits that
 
02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
they have thank you for that question
 
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh I think our reaction
 
02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
is because under existing
 
02:54:37.550 --> 02:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
legislation both the statutes in place
 
02:54:40.030 --> 02:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
now and our
 
02:54:43.870 --> 02:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
bylaws explicitly give the members the
 
02:54:47.790 --> 02:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
ability to by fil on a petition to do
 
02:54:51.190 --> 02:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill requires in 24
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
years we haven't gotten a peep of
 
02:54:55.630 --> 02:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
members suggesting we want you to be
 
02:54:59.110 --> 02:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
regulated I mean we haven't got a single
 
02:55:02.510 --> 02:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
petition uh on that subject so the
 
02:55:05.590 --> 02:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
reaction that we have by addressing the
 
02:55:09.429 --> 02:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
downsides of Regulation is this bill in
 
02:55:12.229 --> 02:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
in essence says that's not good enough
 
02:55:16.030 --> 02:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
the will of the members the legislature
 
02:55:18.110 --> 02:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
and the governor by signing this would
 
02:55:21.309 --> 02:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
be in saying in essence that we think
 
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
you should be
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
regulated uh because otherwise uh the
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
the existing power of the members
 
02:55:31.630 --> 02:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
through our own democratic system allows
 
02:55:35.309 --> 02:55:35.319 align:start position:0%
it so this wouldn't be necessary as to
 
02:55:39.309 --> 02:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
toot in our own horn we have
 
02:55:42.150 --> 02:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
monthly uh newsletters that we send to
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
all all members uh describing what we do
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
for them uh you know encourages uh
 
02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
conservation tell them the benefits that
 
02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
we have we're tooting our horns on a
 
02:55:57.550 --> 02:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
regular basis we have a whole section
 
02:56:00.229 --> 02:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
that of our our
 
02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
organization uh for communications that
 
02:56:06.429 --> 02:56:06.439 align:start position:0%
that that that that tell that so we see
 
02:56:08.309 --> 02:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
the only
 
02:56:12.030 --> 02:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
only only effect of this is to add cost
 
02:56:15.389 --> 02:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
to us on elction and asking the members
 
02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
to do something that they already have
 
02:56:20.269 --> 02:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:20.279 --> 02:56:22.110 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:56:22.110 --> 02:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:24.600 align:start position:0%

02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
you that's a great question I I don't
 
02:57:42.229 --> 02:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
know that I'm prepared to discuss that
 
02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
today on what the implications would be
 
02:57:46.670 --> 02:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
to the extent of of the puc's regulation
 
02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
there but um that is something that the
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
Cooperative has had a lot of flexibility
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
to to implement due to his deregulated
 
02:57:55.269 --> 02:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
status and and being able to give back
 
02:57:58.830 --> 02:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:01.760 align:start position:0%

questions thank you gentlemen appreciate

from the state consumer Advocate Mr Don
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%

02:58:16.349 --> 02:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning or good
 
02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon actually Mr Mr cre nice to
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
have you
 
02:58:23.110 --> 02:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
back good afternoon uh chairman Vose
 
02:58:25.030 --> 02:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh as
 
02:58:26.910 --> 02:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
you just heard my name is Donald cree
 
02:58:29.429 --> 02:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
and for almost nine years now I've had
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
the honor of serving as this state's
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate this is my first
 
02:58:37.309 --> 02:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify this session so
 
02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh for those of you who might be
 
02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with me uh I lead the very
 
02:58:43.710 --> 02:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
small independent state agency that
 
02:58:45.389 --> 02:58:45.399 align:start position:0%
fights for the interests of the state's
 
02:58:48.190 --> 02:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers most most
 
02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
of our work happens in connection with
 
02:58:52.469 --> 02:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
cases at the Public Utilities Commission
 
02:58:55.429 --> 02:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
but not all of it one area of particular
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
interest to us is the New Hampshire
 
02:58:59.590 --> 02:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
Electric Cooperative which of course is
 
02:59:01.630 --> 02:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
one of the states for electric utilities
 
02:59:03.550 --> 02:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
but as you already heard the only one
 
02:59:05.469 --> 02:59:05.479 align:start position:0%
that is almost completely beyond the
 
02:59:07.229 --> 02:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of the Public Utilities
 
02:59:09.630 --> 02:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
Commission the reason is that back on
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
June 6th 2000 almost a quarter century
 
02:59:15.910 --> 02:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
ago and pursuant to what was then a
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
recently enacted statute the up filed
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
what the law refers to as a certificate
 
02:59:24.349 --> 02:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
of deregulation with the commission uh
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
in essence the filing of and I should
 
02:59:28.990 --> 02:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
say that the that certificate was filed
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
because the members of the co-op back in
 
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
2000 voted by a super majority to
 
02:59:37.070 --> 02:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
authorize its filing in essence the
 
02:59:39.070 --> 02:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
filing of that certificate means the Pu
 
02:59:40.870 --> 02:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
no longer approves the co-op's rates in
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
terms of service and the logic for doing
 
02:59:44.349 --> 02:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
that as you've already heard is very
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
compelling the Pu exists to serve as the
 
02:59:50.670 --> 02:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
Arbiter of the interests of the utility
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
shareholders and the utility customers
 
02:59:55.269 --> 02:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
but at an Electric Co-op the
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
shareholders and the customers are the
 
02:59:59.630 --> 02:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
same people the customers themselves
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
known in Cooperative parlament as
 
03:00:03.710 --> 03:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
members don't just own their utility
 
03:00:06.190 --> 03:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
they also control it through a board of
 
03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
directors that the members elect I
 
03:00:10.870 --> 03:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
really love that I love it as a rate
 
03:00:13.070 --> 03:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
payer Advocate letting the rate payers
 
03:00:15.190 --> 03:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
control their own utility without the
 
03:00:17.229 --> 03:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
government getting in the way I love it
 
03:00:19.790 --> 03:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
as a long time cooperator I've served as
 
03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
the president of the board of the
 
03:00:23.550 --> 03:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
nation's second biggest Cooperative
 
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
grosser which happens to be based right
 
03:00:27.389 --> 03:00:27.399 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I've also been
 
03:00:28.710 --> 03:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
the president of the board of the
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
Cooperative fund of the Northeast which
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
has lent millions and millions of
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
dollars to co-ops of all types and I
 
03:00:38.110 --> 03:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
love it as a fan of democracy so in the
 
03:00:41.190 --> 03:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
name of democracy House Bill 95 makes a
 
03:00:44.190 --> 03:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
small tweak to the applicable law in the
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
interest of enhancing the hallowed
 
03:00:49.030 --> 03:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
Cooperative principle of Democratic
 
03:00:53.630 --> 03:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
member control it has been a long time a
 
03:00:56.190 --> 03:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
very long time since the members of the
 
03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elector Cooperative have
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
had a chance to vote on whether their
 
03:01:02.269 --> 03:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
Co-op is doing a good enough job serving
 
03:01:05.150 --> 03:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
its members that oversight by the Pu
 
03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary House Bill 95 would
 
03:01:10.469 --> 03:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
require the co-op if it wants to stay
 
03:01:12.750 --> 03:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
deregulated to put that Quest into the
 
03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
co-op membership every 3 years and yes
 
03:01:17.309 --> 03:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
you could think whether three years is
 
03:01:19.550 --> 03:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
the right period period uh it makes
 
03:01:21.309 --> 03:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
sense for the reason that representative
 
03:01:23.590 --> 03:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
Thomas Wendy Thomas gave that it
 
03:01:25.910 --> 03:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
coincides with the average board term
 
03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
another period might be four years that
 
03:01:29.790 --> 03:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
coincides with the typical period
 
03:01:31.429 --> 03:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
between rate cases at regulated
 
03:01:33.389 --> 03:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
utilities or you could use some other
 
03:01:35.950 --> 03:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
period but you might wonder why come
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
forward with an idea like this now
 
03:01:39.990 --> 03:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's already been asked well to the
 
03:01:42.510 --> 03:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
alarm of many the New Hampshire Electric
 
03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
Cooperative has been in the news of late
 
03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
last year in the wake of the co-ops
 
03:01:51.229 --> 03:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
annual board meeting and and its annual
 
03:01:54.830 --> 03:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
Board election uh the two long serving
 
03:01:57.150 --> 03:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
women on the board one a former board
 
03:01:59.389 --> 03:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
president and the other a former board
 
03:02:02.710 --> 03:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
vice president resigned and they did so
 
03:02:04.990 --> 03:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
rather clamorously alleging that there
 
03:02:08.110 --> 03:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
was a climate of sexism and bullying in
 
03:02:11.229 --> 03:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
the co-op's boardroom the co-op's CEO
 
03:02:12.790 --> 03:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
who happened to be the first woman to
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
serve in that role prais the two
 
03:02:16.590 --> 03:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
resigning board members for their
 
03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
courage and their integrity
 
03:02:20.229 --> 03:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
and she has since tendered her
 
03:02:22.710 --> 03:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
resignation after just two years on the
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
job that's why you heard from her male
 
03:02:28.229 --> 03:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
successor this this afternoon that was
 
03:02:30.910 --> 03:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
really troubling to us at the OCA so I
 
03:02:33.990 --> 03:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
asked the Pu to investigate the Pu
 
03:02:36.510 --> 03:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
declined noting correctly that a
 
03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
certificate of deregulation is on file
 
03:02:38.960 --> 03:02:39.830 align:start position:0%
certificate of deregulation is on file
and

03:02:39.830 --> 03:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:42.349 --> 03:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
effective why is House Bill 95 a mere
 
03:02:44.429 --> 03:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
tweak because current law allows the
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
members of the co-op to ask for a vote
 
03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
on revoking that certificate of
 
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
deregulation House Bill 95 would make
 
03:02:54.550 --> 03:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
such a revote automatic every 3 years
 
03:02:56.349 --> 03:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
honorable legislators think about
 
03:02:57.710 --> 03:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
everything that has happened in the
 
03:03:00.190 --> 03:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
electric industry since the co-op filed
 
03:03:02.469 --> 03:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
that certificate of deregulation 25
 
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
years ago restructuring distributed
 
03:03:07.630 --> 03:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
generation Community power aggregation
 
03:03:10.590 --> 03:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
changes in wholesale electricity market
 
03:03:13.309 --> 03:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
and at the Electric Co-op an intriguing
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
but in some circles very controversial
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
foray into rural Broadband deployment
 
03:03:20.910 --> 03:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
and let me just say in response to the
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
testimony I just heard that regulation
 
03:03:25.469 --> 03:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
by the Pu would not have stopped the
 
03:03:27.950 --> 03:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op from operating a
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
Broadband subsidiary it would have
 
03:03:33.070 --> 03:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
assured that electric service doesn't
 
03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
subsidize broadband service or is
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
dragged down by it in the event that
 
03:03:40.510 --> 03:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
broadband service is not financially
 
03:03:42.830 --> 03:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
successful as somebody who has closely
 
03:03:44.469 --> 03:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
observed and cultivated a good
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Electric Co-op
 
03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
since I took office here here's my
 
03:03:50.030 --> 03:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
prediction for what will happen if House
 
03:03:52.550 --> 03:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 95 becomes law the board and
 
03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
management of the co-op will every time
 
03:03:57.429 --> 03:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
it comes up make a persuasive case to
 
03:03:59.590 --> 03:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
the membership that their utility is
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
still worthy of that exemption from pu
 
03:04:04.710 --> 03:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
oversight and the members will renew
 
03:04:06.990 --> 03:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
that certificate of deregulation every
 
03:04:09.710 --> 03:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
time the question comes up but requiring
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
that question to come up periodically
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
will be healthy for this utility and its
 
03:04:16.830 --> 03:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
customers and it just might serve as a
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
good example for those those of us who
 
03:04:20.510 --> 03:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
are not fortunate enough to own the
 
03:04:22.710 --> 03:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
electricity or the electric utility that
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
serves us I think that's all I have to
 
03:04:26.349 --> 03:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
say so thank you for hearing my
 
03:04:28.630 --> 03:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and of course I'd be happy to
 
03:04:30.790 --> 03:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that chairman V
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
might be willing to
 
03:04:34.990 --> 03:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
entertain thank you very much appreciate
 
03:04:40.030 --> 03:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
it I'd like to just sort of paraphrase
 
03:04:42.550 --> 03:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
your argument in a single sentence if I
 
03:04:45.910 --> 03:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
could you think that the turnover in New
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op customers and
 
03:04:50.590 --> 03:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
board members justifies a more frequent
 
03:04:52.389 --> 03:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
endorsement of
 
03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
deregulation Yes actually that's the
 
03:04:56.830 --> 03:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
point I didn't make that but it's sort
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
of implicit right I mean in the last 25
 
03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
years there's been enough turnover in
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
the core of members who are uh dependent
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
on the electric Co for service that
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
really relying on a vote that took place
 
03:05:11.750 --> 03:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
in June of or in the spring of 2000
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't really represent the current
 
03:05:15.469 --> 03:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
body of New Hampshire Electric Co-op
 
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
members thank you additional
 
03:05:24.750 --> 03:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:28.950 --> 03:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
some so uh just to be clear uh there's
 
03:05:31.750 --> 03:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
never you know there was a deregulation
 
03:05:33.590 --> 03:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
certificate initially and there hasn't
 
03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
been one since and there won't be
 
03:05:38.590 --> 03:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
another one unless there is this
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
requirement put in place yes but uh as I
 
03:05:45.070 --> 03:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
think either Mr Jennings or Mr Darcy
 
03:05:48.349 --> 03:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
pointed out to you the co-op's bylaws do
 
03:05:51.670 --> 03:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
authorize the uh Co-op to place that
 
03:05:53.630 --> 03:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
question before the membership again on
 
03:05:55.990 --> 03:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
Petition of a certain number of members
 
03:05:58.190 --> 03:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
I think it might be I think it's a
 
03:06:01.150 --> 03:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
hundred it might be more uh so all I'm
 
03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
suggesting to you and representative
 
03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
Tomas was kind enough to credit me with
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
the idea for this bill I think that's
 
03:06:10.349 --> 03:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
true is making that revote automatic I
 
03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
that representative McGee has question
 
03:06:20.670 --> 03:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
coming here and testifying for us and
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
helping to explain some of these uh
 
03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
issues to us um my question is around
 
03:06:29.110 --> 03:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
the money that was mentioned in the
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from the co-op um they
 
03:06:34.269 --> 03:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned that 605,000 was an estimate
 
03:06:37.710 --> 03:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
from the Pu for um what it would cost
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission to I
 
03:06:42.070 --> 03:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
guess engage additional resources in
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
order to manage an additional regulated
 
03:06:47.790 --> 03:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
utility but this bill doesn't this
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh result in them becoming a
 
03:06:52.550 --> 03:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
regulated utility so I think it's a bit
 
03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
of a stretch to say that there's any
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
money really associated with it although
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the co-op did mention
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
that there would be a cost to the
 
03:07:04.830 --> 03:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
elections themselves which might be an
 
03:07:06.750 --> 03:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
argument for it being on a longer time
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
frame than a shorter time frame do you
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense yourself on what
 
03:07:13.349 --> 03:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
kind of cost would be associated with
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
that because I think most things are
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
done electronically now so I don't I
 
03:07:18.229 --> 03:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
don't know how they vote
 
03:07:20.229 --> 03:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh the the the additional cost to the
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
co-op would be zero because the co-op
 
03:07:25.229 --> 03:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
already has an annual election this
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
presumably would take place as part of
 
03:07:29.910 --> 03:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
that uh the co-op is as it testified is
 
03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
already trying to be as responsive and
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
interactive and transparent as it can so
 
03:07:36.870 --> 03:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
presumably the incremental cost of
 
03:07:39.870 --> 03:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
having to make an argument every four or
 
03:07:42.830 --> 03:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
three or five years that yes we remain
 
03:07:45.710 --> 03:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
worthy of non-regulation would be zero
 
03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
they already have people to do that uh
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
and as far as the additional cost of the
 
03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
Pu of Regulation I I want to be
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
forthright regulation imposes costs I
 
03:07:58.269 --> 03:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
mean and if I were the CEO of the
 
03:08:00.790 --> 03:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op if I had to make the case
 
03:08:02.469 --> 03:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
to my members that they should not
 
03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
revoke or resend the certificate of
 
03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
deregulation that's that's one of the
 
03:08:09.630 --> 03:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
points I would make for
 
03:08:12.790 --> 03:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
sure follow up the only other thing I
 
03:08:13.950 --> 03:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
would ask is what do you think the
 
03:08:15.550 --> 03:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
likelihood is that the membership would
 
03:08:18.150 --> 03:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
vote to become a regulated ility because
 
03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
I if I were in there uh in service area
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
I don't think I ever would vote that way
 
03:08:24.830 --> 03:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't think it's likely you
 
03:08:25.990 --> 03:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
know so I'm just wondering if you have
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
any idea I I agree with you
 
03:08:29.790 --> 03:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGee that it's very
 
03:08:32.190 --> 03:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
unlikely again what I'm trying to say is
 
03:08:34.110 --> 03:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's really healthy for the
 
03:08:35.950 --> 03:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
co-op to have to make that case every
 
03:08:38.670 --> 03:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
few years and I fully expect that the
 
03:08:41.110 --> 03:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
members if the management of the co-op
 
03:08:43.070 --> 03:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
and the board of the co-op is as
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
responsive to member needs as they claim
 
03:08:47.469 --> 03:08:47.479 align:start position:0%
they are then of course the membership
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
ship will overwhelmingly say nope we
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
like things just the way they
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
are representative Bernardi has a
 
03:09:01.510 --> 03:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um so the
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
issue that you have identified as a
 
03:09:07.349 --> 03:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
causitive factor for this bill is
 
03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
turnover of officers at at the
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
co-op none no issue like Broadband costs
 
03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:18.190 align:start position:0%
co-op none no issue like Broadband costs
of

03:09:18.190 --> 03:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:19.710 align:start position:0%
of
impacting

03:09:19.710 --> 03:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
impacting
 
03:09:23.469 --> 03:09:23.479 align:start position:0%
electric uh costs or nothing associated
 
03:09:26.670 --> 03:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
with the physical Services provided by
 
03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
the co-op have been adversely impacted
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
just this turnover issue is that is that
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
the basis and if it is why is a an
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
election like this required to address
 
03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
election like this required to address
that

03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:42.030 --> 03:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
problem uh with respect representative
 
03:09:44.030 --> 03:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I I don't agree with the
 
03:09:47.070 --> 03:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
premise of your question uh turnover at
 
03:09:51.070 --> 03:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
the Board of an elected uh turnover on
 
03:09:53.630 --> 03:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
the board of an Electric Co-op uh which
 
03:09:55.469 --> 03:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
of course elects its board members from
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
among the membership of the overall
 
03:10:01.070 --> 03:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
utility is a natural consequence of that
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
democracy what I'm expressing or what I
 
03:10:06.990 --> 03:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns about was turmoil in
 
03:10:09.510 --> 03:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
the electric co-op's boardroom of such
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
intensity that it led to veteran members
 
03:10:14.190 --> 03:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
of the board both of whom who helped
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
lead the board and both of whom were
 
03:10:19.870 --> 03:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
women and areen women to resign publicly
 
03:10:21.950 --> 03:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
and loudly alleging that they were
 
03:10:24.309 --> 03:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with a climate of bullying and
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
sexism and I think it's fair to say that
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
that climate of bullying and sexism is
 
03:10:32.590 --> 03:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
causally related to the decision of the
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
female CEO of the Electric Co-op to
 
03:10:37.910 --> 03:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
leave and relocate her family to another
 
03:10:40.950 --> 03:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
state after just two years on the job as
 
03:10:42.590 --> 03:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
to whether any of that had any
 
03:10:45.070 --> 03:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
relationship to the actual merits of
 
03:10:47.309 --> 03:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
what the Electric Co-op does I'm quite
 
03:10:49.030 --> 03:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
certain that it did but I don't have
 
03:10:51.510 --> 03:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
access to that why do I not have access
 
03:10:57.550 --> 03:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:59.990 --> 03:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
regulated any additional questions
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative schneller thank you Mr
 
03:11:04.510 --> 03:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
03:11:07.349 --> 03:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
testimony uh just a question did any of
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
this turnover or
 
03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
turmoil uh lead to complaints of higher
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
rates I don't know the answer to that
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:23.790 --> 03:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions I
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr Cree for being here
 
03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
my pleasure thank you and next I'll call
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
up Alex spidel from the Public Utilities
 
03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
Commission to give us the commission's
 
03:11:40.710 --> 03:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
legislation good afternoon chairman Vos
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee thank you
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
for having me uh this may be an unusual
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
thing to here down in Washington DC
 
03:11:51.790 --> 03:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
you'd never hear an Federal agency
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
wherein a proposed piece of legislation
 
03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
open a potential door for regulation of
 
03:12:02.910 --> 03:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
a new company or a new industry um and
 
03:12:04.349 --> 03:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
down there in Washington they wouldn't
 
03:12:06.349 --> 03:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
say we're not interested in that but the
 
03:12:07.950 --> 03:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
commission does oppose this bill and
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're not interested in taking this
 
03:12:12.510 --> 03:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
approach and we would prefer that the
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
Cooperative remain uh deregulated as it
 
03:12:17.670 --> 03:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
currently is under the author of the
 
03:12:19.630 --> 03:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
legislature and its current deregulation
 
03:12:21.389 --> 03:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
certificate so there's a few reasons I
 
03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of things on the dock
 
03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
today Mr chairman I'll be short uh in a
 
03:12:29.830 --> 03:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
nutshell The Cooperative is deregulated
 
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
under the authority of the legislature
 
03:12:34.229 --> 03:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
because much like a municipal utility
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
where you have say at Manchester
 
03:12:37.229 --> 03:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
Waterworks you have the board of
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
Alderman and the mayor pick the director
 
03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
of the Manchester Waterworks the owners
 
03:12:44.790 --> 03:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the utility are the customers of the
 
03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
utility so there's a line of democratic
 
03:12:49.030 --> 03:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
account ability up through the board of
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
directors and then the management team
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
so that's a little bit different from an
 
03:12:54.510 --> 03:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
investment owned utility that has a
 
03:12:56.990 --> 03:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
classic Monopoly power over the
 
03:12:59.990 --> 03:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
customers and the shareholders of the
 
03:13:03.229 --> 03:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
utility pick uh the management team
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
there so there's it's a little bit
 
03:13:08.070 --> 03:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
different but the nutshell is that um
 
03:13:10.469 --> 03:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
there's a few issues with this uh we
 
03:13:12.670 --> 03:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
have heard the testimony in the
 
03:13:15.070 --> 03:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
description that the hypothetical cost
 
03:13:17.870 --> 03:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
of 600,000 that was presided presented
 
03:13:23.550 --> 03:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
by the Pu in the fiscal note is not a
 
03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
100% guarantee that that will happen we
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
just offered that as the likely cost of
 
03:13:30.990 --> 03:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
doing business if the Cooperative were
 
03:13:35.389 --> 03:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
to vote for regulation by the Pu P
 
03:13:38.070 --> 03:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
because uh we're at capacity right now
 
03:13:42.309 --> 03:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
we have a staff of 12 line employees and
 
03:13:44.469 --> 03:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners and we're at
 
03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
capacity right now we have a r Cas cycle
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
every year for major utilities we have
 
03:13:51.309 --> 03:13:51.319 align:start position:0%
many small utility filings coming in all
 
03:13:54.070 --> 03:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
the time so we just wanted to alert to
 
03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature that if the Cooperative
 
03:13:58.510 --> 03:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
joined us as a full-fledged electric
 
03:14:00.750 --> 03:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
utility um there's always teething
 
03:14:03.469 --> 03:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
troubles associated with potential uh
 
03:14:05.790 --> 03:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
filing requirements they would have to
 
03:14:08.469 --> 03:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
move from a I understand from some
 
03:14:10.349 --> 03:14:10.359 align:start position:0%
research that they're on a roughly
 
03:14:13.630 --> 03:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
twomon lead time for a rate change
 
03:14:15.429 --> 03:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
they'd have to go to a full year rate
 
03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
case cycle they'd have toar learn how to
 
03:14:19.710 --> 03:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
file certain Financial forms with us and
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
there's teething troubles that come with
 
03:14:24.269 --> 03:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
that kind of process every time uh and
 
03:14:27.990 --> 03:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
so in general what we would recommend is
 
03:14:30.349 --> 03:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
that we leave things that the way they
 
03:14:32.910 --> 03:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
are with the Cooperative we see no need
 
03:14:34.910 --> 03:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
or necessity under the any theor
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
regulation to take control of the
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
cooperative's Affairs through
 
03:14:43.389 --> 03:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
regulation and so um we would um just
 
03:14:45.190 --> 03:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
leave it at that thank
 
03:14:50.070 --> 03:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you question for the Pu Tom
 
03:14:52.830 --> 03:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
PL thank you chair and thank you for
 
03:14:55.110 --> 03:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
coming in um does the
 
03:14:59.870 --> 03:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
Pu presently have any interaction with
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire co-op we have a
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
limited role in the realm of Energy
 
03:15:06.910 --> 03:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
Efficiency so as you know the
 
03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislature has a very prominent role in
 
03:15:12.750 --> 03:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency regulations since 2021
 
03:15:14.389 --> 03:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
but as part of that the Cooperative has
 
03:15:16.429 --> 03:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
always interacted with us by making
 
03:15:18.349 --> 03:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
periodic Energy Efficiency rate
 
03:15:21.150 --> 03:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
adjustment filings and that's actually
 
03:15:23.150 --> 03:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
kind of based on a mechanical Adder
 
03:15:25.469 --> 03:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
right now for their expense but they do
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
make them with the commission and also
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
the department of energy I do believe
 
03:15:32.750 --> 03:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
interacts with the Cooperative on the
 
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
field of safety regulation for their
 
03:15:35.920 --> 03:15:38.030 align:start position:0%
field of safety regulation for their
physical

03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
physical
 
03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
plant representative Summers has a
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh pertaining
 
03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
to the uh regulation d regulation of New
 
03:15:50.030 --> 03:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire co-op uh two years ago
 
03:15:52.189 --> 03:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
beginning of the last term we had
 
03:15:54.349 --> 03:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
extremely bad weather we had and the
 
03:15:56.550 --> 03:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
rates were extremely high and if I
 
03:15:58.830 --> 03:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
recall from earlier earlier that term
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
last term that the um electrical rates
 
03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
of the co-op were significantly cheaper
 
03:16:07.389 --> 03:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
than the the other organizations down
 
03:16:09.309 --> 03:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
here in the South and the New Hampshire
 
03:16:11.790 --> 03:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
co-op I believe was able to Lad or hedge
 
03:16:15.150 --> 03:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
against pricing does reg if it would
 
03:16:18.269 --> 03:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
become uh regulated would that have any
 
03:16:21.389 --> 03:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
effect on the price that the co-op is
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
able to offer to its rate
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
payers I would like to say in general
 
03:16:29.070 --> 03:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
that uh if anything The Cooperative was
 
03:16:31.510 --> 03:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
able to teach the commission about what
 
03:16:34.349 --> 03:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
to do uh in the wake of the 2022 Market
 
03:16:35.790 --> 03:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
Panic rather than the other way around
 
03:16:37.030 --> 03:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
and if you don't mind me turning the
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
question a little bit around Mr
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative because what happened at
 
03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
that time is we had an investigation at
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
the commission regarding the market
 
03:16:47.550 --> 03:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
prices for electricity
 
03:16:49.870 --> 03:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
and the Cooperative was kind enough to
 
03:16:51.790 --> 03:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
they had no obligation to do so but its
 
03:16:54.030 --> 03:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
leadership was kind enough to offer us a
 
03:16:56.349 --> 03:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
response to one of our inquiries that we
 
03:16:58.750 --> 03:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
also made of the Municipal Utilities
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
around the state like Littleton Power
 
03:17:03.910 --> 03:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
and Light for instance and each of those
 
03:17:06.229 --> 03:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
gave us very good information about
 
03:17:09.189 --> 03:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
their market-based procurement process
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
lading was investigated and considered
 
03:17:14.830 --> 03:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
but the utilities themselves including
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
eversource also said that there's mixed
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
outcomes from lading they've done it in
 
03:17:20.070 --> 03:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
Southern New England and it's all about
 
03:17:22.510 --> 03:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
the timing so it's kind of like a coin
 
03:17:25.830 --> 03:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
flip game a lot of probabilities if you
 
03:17:28.229 --> 03:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
time it well so that the lading offers
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
you a good price because of when you
 
03:17:33.950 --> 03:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
bought versus when you are exposed to
 
03:17:35.870 --> 03:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
the market it can work but it can go the
 
03:17:37.229 --> 03:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
other way around so I'm trying to
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
summarize some very complex things but
 
03:17:42.990 --> 03:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
what the re-regulation would do is it
 
03:17:46.030 --> 03:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
would move the Cooperative from a
 
03:17:48.189 --> 03:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
structure where it's members vote on the
 
03:17:51.030 --> 03:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
rate increases to where you essentially
 
03:17:53.229 --> 03:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
have the Pu having to adjudicate
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
clunkier okay additional questions M
 
03:18:03.550 --> 03:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative rolds thank you Mr chair
 
03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh I guess given your that that answer
 
03:18:08.269 --> 03:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
that you just gave representative
 
03:18:11.389 --> 03:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
Summers I want to reprise my my question
 
03:18:13.750 --> 03:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
to the co-op's
 
03:18:18.510 --> 03:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
leadership don't you think that
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you're supposed to ask a
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
question of yeah yeah I'm I'm gonna ask
 
03:18:26.670 --> 03:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
the staff staff person from the
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
Pu uh requiring the
 
03:18:30.399 --> 03:18:31.910 align:start position:0%
Pu uh requiring the
co-op

03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
03:18:31.920 --> 03:18:33.429 align:start position:0%
co-op
to

03:18:33.429 --> 03:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:18:35.870 --> 03:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
refile to remain
 
03:18:38.710 --> 03:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
unregulated every three or perhaps every
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
five years don't you
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
think given what you just said about
 
03:18:46.990 --> 03:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
them educating you don't you think think
 
03:18:50.309 --> 03:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
that this the process of refiling could
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
provide a
 
03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
regular opportunity for them to do that
 
03:18:58.630 --> 03:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh to distill their you know monthly
 
03:19:00.830 --> 03:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
member reports into a triennial or an
 
03:19:03.469 --> 03:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
every fiveyear report on why being
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
unregulated is great and the practices
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
that they're able to uh engage in that
 
03:19:11.150 --> 03:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
keep their rates low and service levels
 
03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
High um Mr representative I would say
 
03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
that the Pu is confident that the com
 
03:19:18.269 --> 03:19:18.279 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative can manage its own
 
03:19:20.469 --> 03:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
Affairs as it is we don't really need to
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
hear from them they did that of their
 
03:19:25.269 --> 03:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
own free will and I think that it could
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
be sort of um a resource strain I think
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're pretty thinly staffed themselves
 
03:19:32.870 --> 03:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're a tight operation and so
 
03:19:34.349 --> 03:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
if they have to essentially run the
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a political campaign every
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
3 years to say we don't want to be
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
regulated given what's happening in the
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
World At
 
03:19:44.670 --> 03:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
Large um they would be distracted I
 
03:19:46.830 --> 03:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
think from their core mission of serving
 
03:19:48.990 --> 03:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
their membership and so we don't have
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
anything to do with them directly we
 
03:19:53.150 --> 03:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
just wish them well and we're keying off
 
03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we want to make clear
 
03:19:58.469 --> 03:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
that we're not eager to seize uh
 
03:20:00.910 --> 03:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over this unregulated
 
03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative utility that's we thought
 
03:20:06.070 --> 03:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.590 --> 03:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
important okay seeing no further
 
03:20:10.429 --> 03:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you for being
 
03:20:14.030 --> 03:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
here to testify we appreciate that and
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
since I have no more pink cards on this
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh issue I'm going to close the public
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 95
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
FN and I will now open the public
 
03:20:30.670 --> 03:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
03:20:33.550 --> 03:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
166 and I believe that Representative
 
03:20:36.429 --> 03:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
Keith Ammon is going to introduce this
 
03:20:39.389 --> 03:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
bill to us so I will call Representative
 
03:20:42.070 --> 03:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
Ammon forward so that we can learn about
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 166 good morning or good
 
03:20:47.269 --> 03:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative Ammon
 
03:20:49.189 --> 03:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
03:20:52.469 --> 03:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
the science technology and energy
 
03:20:55.429 --> 03:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm I'm pinch hitting for
 
03:20:55.439 --> 03:20:56.750 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm I'm pinch hitting for
representative

03:20:56.750 --> 03:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:21:00.910 --> 03:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh so I'll defer questions to
 
03:21:03.510 --> 03:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
maybe hopefully experts behind
 
03:21:06.269 --> 03:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
me so this bill is a study commission
 
03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
Bill House Bill 166 establishes a
 
03:21:10.189 --> 03:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
committee to review internet service
 
03:21:13.710 --> 03:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
provider infrastructure transition plan
 
03:21:16.710 --> 03:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
from copper to fiber
 
03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
so this is this is my understanding on
 
03:21:22.030 --> 03:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
the bill uh I'm going to use air quotes
 
03:21:24.189 --> 03:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
here uh a
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
whistleblower from an ISP came forward
 
03:21:30.389 --> 03:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
and said that there is an inevitable
 
03:21:33.510 --> 03:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
progression from copper to fiber in the
 
03:21:38.429 --> 03:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
in in with isps but that there's some uh
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
market dynamics that are making these
 
03:21:45.229 --> 03:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
efforts to convert from copper to fiber
 
03:21:47.229 --> 03:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
potentially UNS sustainable or
 
03:21:50.110 --> 03:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
potentially disruptive to the market we
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
all know how how important internet is
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's critical
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so representative Edwards
 
03:21:58.189 --> 03:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
was contacted by an employee familiar
 
03:22:00.870 --> 03:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
with the plan I don't know the ISP I
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't know the
 
03:22:04.349 --> 03:22:04.359 align:start position:0%
employee but the employee stated a
 
03:22:06.030 --> 03:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
concern that the plan is obviously too
 
03:22:08.269 --> 03:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
aggressive and that if attempted as
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
intended it might lead to outages
 
03:22:12.429 --> 03:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
particularly in rural areas and or call
 
03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
Cost spikes for individual residences to
 
03:22:17.389 --> 03:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
buy in on earlier
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
conversion and so what this study
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
commission if you look at line 13 the
 
03:22:24.389 --> 03:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
duties it's basically a
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
sunlight exercise where the isps would
 
03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
be asked to come in and discuss their
 
03:22:32.590 --> 03:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
plan there would be representation or
 
03:22:35.469 --> 03:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
there' be consultation with the Pu and
 
03:22:37.750 --> 03:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
other subject matter
 
03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
experts um and represent representative
 
03:22:42.830 --> 03:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
Edwards States in an email he says the
 
03:22:44.910 --> 03:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislature should invite key players
 
03:22:46.670 --> 03:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders to share their facts
 
03:22:49.389 --> 03:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
and assumptions such that an informed
 
03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
decision may be made about whether any
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
intervention in the market around the
 
03:22:57.110 --> 03:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
fiber infrastructure plan is
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate so that's about the extent
 
03:23:01.469 --> 03:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge on the bill I am a
 
03:23:03.950 --> 03:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but I'm not privy to the the
 
03:23:05.189 --> 03:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
conversations that representative
 
03:23:05.199 --> 03:23:06.510 align:start position:0%
conversations that representative
Edwards

03:23:06.510 --> 03:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
03:23:09.630 --> 03:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
had so uh happy to take any questions
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
and I'll do my best okay thank you
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
representative do we have any questions
 
03:23:19.309 --> 03:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:21.309 --> 03:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy
 
03:23:23.790 --> 03:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you I finally get to ask a
 
03:23:27.550 --> 03:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
question um you said that this uh commit
 
03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee not commission committee would
 
03:23:32.750 --> 03:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh be in consultation with the
 
03:23:35.590 --> 03:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
Pu why wasn't it turned into a
 
03:23:37.750 --> 03:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
commission with them being a member of
 
03:23:40.150 --> 03:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
this I don't know the answer to that
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
okay but a committee is just among the
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
legislature so right if you notice it
 
03:23:46.030 --> 03:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
was very thoughtful of Representative
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
Edwards to include bipartisanship in the
 
03:23:50.710 --> 03:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee so you'll notice that it's
 
03:23:54.150 --> 03:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
members of each Party House and Senate
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
followup follow up um and also you
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
testified that this bill came about
 
03:24:01.389 --> 03:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
because of a disgruntled employee that
 
03:24:03.110 --> 03:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
you I did not use the word disgruntled
 
03:24:06.830 --> 03:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
just the correct yeah a what well you
 
03:24:09.189 --> 03:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
you used whistleblower in in quotes and
 
03:24:10.990 --> 03:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
then you talked about an employee that
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
was not happy maybe I interpreted it as
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
disgruntled who was not happy because
 
03:24:18.189 --> 03:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
they said that it was going to go too
 
03:24:20.469 --> 03:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
slow or something like that I believe
 
03:24:22.189 --> 03:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to go too quickly that
 
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
maybe there are
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh the way I understand it that that
 
03:24:28.990 --> 03:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
there may be Market forces this is a
 
03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
highly regulated market right there may
 
03:24:35.150 --> 03:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
be uh incentives that are misaligned and
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
the the the concern is that it might
 
03:24:39.870 --> 03:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
cause outages or cost overruns
 
03:24:41.550 --> 03:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
particularly in rural areas we know
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
we're all trying to get Broadband to the
 
03:24:45.630 --> 03:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
rural areas but just to clarify so this
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
bill came about because of one employee
 
03:24:50.710 --> 03:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
correct and then excuse me
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas remember you have
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
to get permission from the chair to ask
 
03:24:56.070 --> 03:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
followup questions I know but he started
 
03:24:59.110 --> 03:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
talking before I could finish my
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
question okay maybe if you asked good
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
concise questions and he would be able
 
03:25:10.309 --> 03:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
succinctly go ahead I'm not asking
 
03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:17.189 align:start position:0%
succinctly go ahead I'm not asking
questions

03:25:17.189 --> 03:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:20.269 --> 03:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
03:25:22.950 --> 03:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh would it be best to
 
03:25:24.910 --> 03:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
keep questions for somebody else on the
 
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of the bill like I
 
03:25:28.469 --> 03:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
said I do my best if you if you want to
 
03:25:30.750 --> 03:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
ask me a question but I I gave you the
 
03:25:32.110 --> 03:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much the extent of my knowledge
 
03:25:34.229 --> 03:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
on this legislation that on wait thank
 
03:25:36.269 --> 03:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
you yeah we do have one more person who
 
03:25:38.670 --> 03:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
has signed up to testify and she is
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this industry so she
 
03:25:43.389 --> 03:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
may be able to provide more
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
information representative Kaplan did
 
03:25:47.630 --> 03:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
03:25:49.150 --> 03:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you Mr chair I guess
 
03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
I'll go ahead and ask my question and
 
03:25:52.110 --> 03:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully representative Ammon can can
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
answer it I not sure maybe might be too
 
03:25:57.189 --> 03:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
technical but um given that these are
 
03:25:59.389 --> 03:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
internet service providers under the the
 
03:26:01.990 --> 03:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
the regulatory domain of the Pu
 
03:26:05.189 --> 03:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that's right so wouldn't an
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
issue like this be already under the
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework of a docket say it
 
03:26:12.670 --> 03:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
may not be on anyone's radar at this
 
03:26:14.550 --> 03:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
point I think this like I said this is
 
03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
an exercise at sunlight that's the way I
 
03:26:17.830 --> 03:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
03:26:21.070 --> 03:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
so representative Harrington yeah just
 
03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
just a comment these the uh pu does not
 
03:26:25.429 --> 03:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
regulate internet they're regulated by
 
03:26:29.309 --> 03:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
the FCC the state or no no state agency
 
03:26:31.950 --> 03:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
or does any does the Pu regulate them at
 
03:26:35.070 --> 03:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
all okay correct
 
03:26:39.150 --> 03:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
then representativ bares has a
 
03:26:41.070 --> 03:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman and thank
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
you observative Amon for taking my
 
03:26:45.790 --> 03:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
question um is you said that this is a
 
03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
sunlight Bill does that mean that the
 
03:26:50.150 --> 03:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
people you mentioned that are unnamed
 
03:26:52.870 --> 03:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
will come and testify or How would how
 
03:26:55.870 --> 03:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
would the details come about if uh the
 
03:26:58.030 --> 03:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
Pu doesn't know these details and nobody
 
03:27:00.990 --> 03:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
else knows these details so I I don't I
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
doubt that an individual will come and
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
testify uh but I think the idea is to
 
03:27:08.429 --> 03:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
have the isps just present their plans
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
and just just so that we have some uh
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
you know oversight insight into what
 
03:27:15.790 --> 03:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
they're planning to make sure that it's
 
03:27:17.229 --> 03:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
not going to lead to outages I think
 
03:27:19.389 --> 03:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
03:27:21.910 --> 03:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
idea so the the information will come
 
03:27:22.990 --> 03:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:27:27.070 --> 03:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
hypothetically followup have you heard
 
03:27:32.229 --> 03:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
anything from isbs saying that there are
 
03:27:35.429 --> 03:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
issues representative brunsky I uh I
 
03:27:37.070 --> 03:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
gave you pretty much all the information
 
03:27:38.830 --> 03:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
I have on this bill so what so
 
03:27:41.309 --> 03:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards he attended I
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
think I can divulge this a black tie
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
event yesterday in DC and he wasn't able
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
to make it back home in time so maybe
 
03:27:49.750 --> 03:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
when he gets
 
03:27:52.510 --> 03:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
back okay thank you I appreciate you
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
testifying for representative Edwards
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
now let's hear from M
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
Teresa representative
 
03:28:05.229 --> 03:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
Corman one more question thank you for
 
03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
taking my late uh for recognizing me for
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
my late question and thank you
 
03:28:11.070 --> 03:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative adman for taking my
 
03:28:12.990 --> 03:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm trying to understand
 
03:28:15.189 --> 03:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
what the outcome of this might be it's
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh it says that there might be
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislation so do you have any idea what
 
03:28:21.630 --> 03:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
sort of legislation we'd be looking at
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
would it be something that would say
 
03:28:27.110 --> 03:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
that the Pu can get involved
 
03:28:29.550 --> 03:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
here potentially I mean it would be up
 
03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
to the commission to decide if anything
 
03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
is appropriate at all right but um
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
depending on what's uncovered that's
 
03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
that would inform the the commission to
 
03:28:39.040 --> 03:28:43.269 align:start position:0%
that would inform the the commission to
recommend

03:28:43.269 --> 03:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
legislation okay thank you very much
 
03:28:47.469 --> 03:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
represent pres ative let's now hear from
 
03:28:47.479 --> 03:28:48.950 align:start position:0%
represent pres ative let's now hear from
Teresa

03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
Teresa
 
03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:57.510 --> 03:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
nhta good afternoon nice to see you
 
03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
again nice to see all of you and this
 
03:29:04.030 --> 03:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
new bium and uh I'm Teresa Rosenberger I
 
03:29:06.990 --> 03:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
work for Bernstein Shore uh a law firm
 
03:29:09.309 --> 03:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and I'm here representing
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire telephone Association and
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Communications that means
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
I'm representing all the landline old
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
mobile telephone companies I'm not
 
03:29:23.309 --> 03:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
representing cable or Wireless I'm just
 
03:29:26.070 --> 03:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
the old mobile telephone companies we
 
03:29:29.670 --> 03:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
are neutral on this bill but frankly we
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
don't really think it's necessar
 
03:29:34.269 --> 03:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
necessary the way the framework is set
 
03:29:37.790 --> 03:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
up now all the companies I represent
 
03:29:40.630 --> 03:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
already have their plans for buildout
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
their goal is
 
03:29:46.189 --> 03:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
100% And um they all have plans and they
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
working towards those plans they have
 
03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
engineering for this year engineering
 
03:29:53.469 --> 03:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
started for next year uh Etc they're all
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
fairly close to 100% now but they are
 
03:30:00.150 --> 03:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
continuing the bill some of the
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
companies have received Federal money
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
and if you've received Federal money in
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
one pot or another you have to let the
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
feds just as those who received arpa
 
03:30:14.830 --> 03:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
money let New Hampshire's Department of
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
Business and economic development know
 
03:30:20.750 --> 03:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
your addresses and where you're going so
 
03:30:23.550 --> 03:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
there is that reporting requirement now
 
03:30:25.429 --> 03:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
to the to the FCC and represent of
 
03:30:25.439 --> 03:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
to the to the FCC and represent of
Harrington's

03:30:26.630 --> 03:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
Harrington's
 
03:30:29.229 --> 03:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
correct it's it's the FCC that's the
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional body um and and the FCC
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
puts out a plan as when it has to be
 
03:30:38.309 --> 03:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
completed as did the New Hampshire uh
 
03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
Bea put out a plan um also the current
 
03:30:44.469 --> 03:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
rules are if you are going to do any
 
03:30:47.229 --> 03:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
discontinuance of cop
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
um you have to notify you have to make
 
03:30:52.790 --> 03:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
an application first to the FCC and then
 
03:30:54.030 --> 03:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
03:30:58.229 --> 03:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
notify uh or we notify the FCC the Pu
 
03:30:59.630 --> 03:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
and the governor's office when you're
 
03:31:03.950 --> 03:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
making that application to discontinu um
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
copper uh the other comment I have is
 
03:31:09.469 --> 03:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
when we looked at the bill it's really
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
only referring to Copper however that's
 
03:31:13.950 --> 03:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
in the first paragraph in the duties it
 
03:31:17.070 --> 03:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't refer to Copper um um we there
 
03:31:21.070 --> 03:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
are other ISP carriers who have used old
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
technologies that are not copper so
 
03:31:25.710 --> 03:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
we're asking why you're making it
 
03:31:28.870 --> 03:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
technology specific to only one segment
 
03:31:29.830 --> 03:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:31:35.189 --> 03:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
industry um the other issue we have is
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
that that if just this segment has to
 
03:31:40.750 --> 03:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
tell you where you're going it gives a
 
03:31:43.189 --> 03:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
real competitive advantage to the other
 
03:31:44.830 --> 03:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
parts of the industry because they know
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
where you're going they know what your
 
03:31:48.269 --> 03:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
plans are and you don't know what theirs
 
03:31:50.790 --> 03:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
are so you can't figure out what's the
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
best place to um to spend your your your
 
03:31:57.870 --> 03:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
Capital dollars and other than that some
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
of the information when they're spending
 
03:32:01.070 --> 03:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
their own money is
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
proprietory so basically bottom line is
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
everybody's moving I'm surprised
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
somebody would say it's going too fast
 
03:32:11.590 --> 03:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
because most people say it's going too
 
03:32:14.910 --> 03:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
slow but um everybody all of my clients
 
03:32:17.229 --> 03:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
have a plan working through their plan
 
03:32:20.590 --> 03:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
and their goal is 100% copper one client
 
03:32:22.710 --> 03:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
for example that has Federal money
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
literally has targets of 50% by this
 
03:32:29.229 --> 03:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
year 75 by that
 
03:32:31.950 --> 03:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
year 100 by the other other clients that
 
03:32:34.790 --> 03:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire AR Perani absolutely
 
03:32:35.790 --> 03:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:32:38.229 --> 03:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
deadline so I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:32:41.229 --> 03:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
questions and um from there it looks
 
03:32:42.710 --> 03:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
like I have a
 
03:32:47.229 --> 03:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
few okay questions for Miss Ro wenberg
 
03:32:49.150 --> 03:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington representative
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman thank
 
03:32:52.590 --> 03:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I guess I
 
03:32:54.269 --> 03:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify one point if you
 
03:32:56.269 --> 03:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
help me here uh you had said that the
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
FCC is the governing body here so I see
 
03:33:02.229 --> 03:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
this part that says any recommendations
 
03:33:04.110 --> 03:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
for proposed legislation to the best of
 
03:33:06.349 --> 03:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
your knowledge would the state of New
 
03:33:08.389 --> 03:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have any authority to impose
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
legislation on the uh the industry the
 
03:33:13.710 --> 03:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
cable industry that's regulated by the
 
03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
Federal Communication Commission thank
 
03:33:16.750 --> 03:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:33:18.309 --> 03:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I do not think
 
03:33:21.389 --> 03:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
so uh the cable industry the isps nor
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
the traditional mbell companies are
 
03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Pu that de the
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
deregulation went in effect I think
 
03:33:30.990 --> 03:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
2012 thank
 
03:33:33.990 --> 03:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
03:33:36.070 --> 03:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um just a
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
point of clarification you testified
 
03:33:41.469 --> 03:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
that um there are other old technologies
 
03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
that are not copper can you just
 
03:33:45.189 --> 03:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
identify those first please uh I think
 
03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
Mrs West is here from the the cable
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
Association but I think Co coax I think
 
03:33:52.670 --> 03:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
the cable uses coax whereas the
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
landlines use copper and I'm not sure
 
03:33:59.469 --> 03:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
besides that but people the
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
industry was and has been in continues
 
03:34:04.950 --> 03:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
to be technology in some ways agnostic I
 
03:34:07.229 --> 03:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
mean there are things out there now that
 
03:34:10.030 --> 03:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that aren't fiber
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
and so um that was why it was peculiar
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
to me that in the the EST establishment
 
03:34:17.910 --> 03:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
it was talking about copper but it
 
03:34:19.870 --> 03:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
didn't in the duties talk talk about
 
03:34:22.349 --> 03:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
copper so I I'm not sure where they
 
03:34:25.070 --> 03:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to go or who who this person is
 
03:34:27.229 --> 03:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
that complain and what industry which
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
part of the industry it is thank you
 
03:34:29.279 --> 03:34:30.590 align:start position:0%
part of the industry it is thank you
you're

03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Summers has a
 
03:34:35.550 --> 03:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
03:34:39.710 --> 03:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
question um be being that I work in the
 
03:34:41.790 --> 03:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
networking field myself I won't make it
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
too technical so I'm try to um forgive
 
03:34:47.469 --> 03:34:47.479 align:start position:0%
me if I do but uh with cost overruns as
 
03:34:51.309 --> 03:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
as was noted by the uh person the sub um
 
03:34:54.429 --> 03:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
person that actually submitted this um
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
the FC with the FCC regulations as well
 
03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the overruns now we know
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
fiber optic cable itself there's not
 
03:35:02.510 --> 03:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
much difference between what size it is
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
oc3 oc2 and that but the O cost actually
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
comes in the switching and the
 
03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
transceivers of the re repeating and the
 
03:35:14.110 --> 03:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh the repeating and the length of the
 
03:35:16.389 --> 03:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
fiber con connectivity
 
03:35:18.510 --> 03:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
um and these would be owned by the
 
03:35:21.189 --> 03:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
service providers so again to go off of
 
03:35:23.030 --> 03:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
what representative Harrington said I
 
03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
know it falls under FCC but would the
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
state would not have any regulation over
 
03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
what equipment switching and
 
03:35:30.990 --> 03:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
transceivers that these companies use
 
03:35:33.389 --> 03:35:33.399 align:start position:0%
correct that is
 
03:35:35.630 --> 03:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
correct representative Kaplan has a
 
03:35:37.469 --> 03:35:37.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:35:39.309 --> 03:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
you m Rosenberger for coming in this
 
03:35:41.229 --> 03:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
might be beating a dead horse but I I
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
think it would be Dar like not to ask it
 
03:35:44.910 --> 03:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
considering what the the testimony of
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsor who came came in and said
 
03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
that there might be electrical outages
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
based on these cost overruns or based on
 
03:35:52.830 --> 03:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
the market dynamics that are at play
 
03:35:55.349 --> 03:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
here in this transition so are you aware
 
03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
at all of anything that would impact on
 
03:36:00.750 --> 03:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
electrical service in this transition
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
impact on on the on the electrical

my head no I'm not I'm not I'm not aware
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
of any cost of runs that would be
 
03:36:16.630 --> 03:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
impacting the electricals service no no
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%

on House Bill
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
526 FN establishing a client climate
 
03:46:27.309 --> 03:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
change and damage division in the
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on representative
 
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas to introduce this
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
legislation oh hey it's me for the
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
record I am Wendy Thomas and I represent
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
the town of marac I'm here to introduce
 
03:46:45.510 --> 03:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 526
 
03:46:48.269 --> 03:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
which seeks to establish the division of
 
03:46:50.149 --> 03:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
climate change and damage within the
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
this division is not just a necessary
 
03:46:57.030 --> 03:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
step toward addressing the growing and
 
03:47:00.030 --> 03:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
Urgent issue of climate change but it is
 
03:47:01.870 --> 03:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
also a Strategic investment in the
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
future of New
 
03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first and foremost the
 
03:47:07.030 --> 03:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
division will focus on climate
 
03:47:09.469 --> 03:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
adaptation planning identifying
 
03:47:12.030 --> 03:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities such as sea level rise
 
03:47:14.070 --> 03:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events and shifting
 
03:47:14.080 --> 03:47:15.750 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events and shifting
ecosystems

03:47:15.750 --> 03:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
ecosystems
 
03:47:17.790 --> 03:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
from recent testimony we have heard
 
03:47:19.950 --> 03:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
about cases of this already happening
 
03:47:22.189 --> 03:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
with the flooding of our Sea Coast the
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
warming of our Winters the higher
 
03:47:27.389 --> 03:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
precipitation in the summer increased
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms in warmer bodies of
 
03:47:32.429 --> 03:47:32.439 align:start position:0%
water and we have even heard from the
 
03:47:34.389 --> 03:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
hydropower folks that our fish
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
population is changing Mount Washington
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
is doing a lot of climate work as is the
 
03:47:43.469 --> 03:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
UNH Cooperative what we need is a
 
03:47:46.030 --> 03:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
repository to gather all of this
 
03:47:48.349 --> 03:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
information by conducting assessments
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
and developing resilience plans the
 
03:47:52.149 --> 03:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
state will be better prepared to protect
 
03:47:54.510 --> 03:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
its communities infrastructure and
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
natural resources with the increasing
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
frequency and severity of climate
 
03:48:01.630 --> 03:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
related events this proactive approach
 
03:48:03.269 --> 03:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
is crucial for safeguarding New
 
03:48:05.429 --> 03:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire's
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
future the creation of this division
 
03:48:10.189 --> 03:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
also ensures that climate action in our
 
03:48:13.030 --> 03:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
state is rooted in sound science and
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
data through research and climate
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
modeling New Hampshire will have the
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
tools to forecast potential climate uh
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
potential future climate conditions and
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
develop informed effective policies the
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
regular monitoring and reporting of
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
climate change impacts will help ensure
 
03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
that the state remains responsive to the
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
changing conditions providing valuable
 
03:48:37.710 --> 03:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
information to both government agencies
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the public equally important is the
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
division's focus on public engagement
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
and education by Leading awareness
 
03:48:49.269 --> 03:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
campaigns and collabor collaborating
 
03:48:51.870 --> 03:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
with local communities businesses and
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
organizations the division will Empower
 
03:48:56.469 --> 03:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
citizens to take sustainable actions and
 
03:48:58.429 --> 03:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
work together toward common climate
 
03:49:01.469 --> 03:49:01.479 align:start position:0%
goals this approach Fosters a culture of
 
03:49:03.510 --> 03:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
cooperation and ensures that New
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's response to climate change
 
03:49:08.830 --> 03:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
is inclusive and community-driven
 
03:49:11.469 --> 03:49:11.479 align:start position:0%
finally the division will play a crucial
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
role in funding and grants management
 
03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
allocating resources to support climate
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
change mitigation and adaptation
 
03:49:23.349 --> 03:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
efforts excuse me by administering
 
03:49:26.149 --> 03:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
incentive programs and supporting local
 
03:49:28.149 --> 03:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
incentives this division will provide
 
03:49:30.670 --> 03:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
the necessary tools and funding to
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
encourage sustainable practices and help
 
03:49:35.590 --> 03:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
businesses and individuals contribute to
 
03:49:38.269 --> 03:49:38.279 align:start position:0%
climate action this bill is not only
 
03:49:40.269 --> 03:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
about addressing the the challenges of
 
03:49:42.149 --> 03:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
climate change it's about seizing the
 
03:49:44.189 --> 03:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to position New Hampshire as
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
a leader
 
03:49:47.309 --> 03:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
in climate resilience and
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
sustainability by creating a division
 
03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this issue we are ensuring
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
that our state remains adaptable
 
03:49:56.830 --> 03:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
responsive and proactive in the face of
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
one of our most pressing issues of our
 
03:50:01.710 --> 03:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
time thank you and I'll take any
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
Thomas for introducing House Bill
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
526 I have a couple of questions for you
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
sure on Page One MH line
 
03:50:19.189 --> 03:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
five and six it says that the director
 
03:50:21.870 --> 03:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
of climate change shall be nominated by
 
03:50:23.309 --> 03:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
03:50:26.269 --> 03:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services from a list of
 
03:50:26.279 --> 03:50:28.269 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services from a list of
three

03:50:28.269 --> 03:50:28.279 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
candidates where does the list of
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
candidates come
 
03:50:34.349 --> 03:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
from and why
 
03:50:36.910 --> 03:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
three uh that is actually wording that
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
was put in there by the OS loyer and
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
that was not in the original text do you
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
remember what your original intent was
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh just that someone would be nominated
 
03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
and and it it didn't have to be from a
 
03:50:52.590 --> 03:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
list of three
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
people okay second question if you go
 
03:51:00.750 --> 03:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
down to uh or go back up to line four it
 
03:51:00.760 --> 03:51:02.349 align:start position:0%
down to uh or go back up to line four it
says

03:51:02.349 --> 03:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
that the division of climate change and
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
damage would be under the supervision of
 
03:51:07.680 --> 03:51:08.830 align:start position:0%
damage would be under the supervision of
an

03:51:08.830 --> 03:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:51:11.550 --> 03:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
unclassified director of climate change
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
and damage would that not indicate that
 
03:51:18.189 --> 03:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
the department would be responsible for
 
03:51:18.199 --> 03:51:19.910 align:start position:0%
the department would be responsible for
hiring

03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
someone and if that is the case wouldn't
 
03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
it be incumbent upon this legislation to
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate funds to the department to
 
03:51:32.429 --> 03:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
do just that the legislation however
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
does not appropriate any funds and the
 
03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
finance committee has told us not to
 
03:51:40.389 --> 03:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
send them any leg legislation that
 
03:51:42.910 --> 03:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
requires the expenditure of funds that
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
are not appropriated well thank you for
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
the question um in order to well from
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
what I understand there are some people
 
03:51:54.030 --> 03:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
within uh Dees that that are uh
 
03:51:56.590 --> 03:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to climate already there there
 
03:52:00.149 --> 03:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
used to be a fellow um and I forget the
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
I forget the position but um he had
 
03:52:05.429 --> 03:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
climate in his title as far as as hiring
 
03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
somebody I would think
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
that this probably would result in the
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
hiring of at least one employee um I am
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
as disappointed as you are at the fiscal
 
03:52:20.149 --> 03:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
note that basically says nobody picked
 
03:52:22.269 --> 03:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
up the phone so we can't uh establish
 
03:52:25.389 --> 03:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
any kind of a uh a price for
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
this and I understand that the the the
 
03:52:30.670 --> 03:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
finance committee has said don't send us
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
any bills that that require um any
 
03:52:38.510 --> 03:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
expenses to me that's not exactly fair
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire because
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
if we have a bill that is very important
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
and that would help the people of New
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to say WR out that we
 
03:52:50.349 --> 03:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even consider it I think is
 
03:52:52.349 --> 03:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
irresponsible well what the finance
 
03:52:54.149 --> 03:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee has said is don't send us
 
03:52:56.590 --> 03:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
money that have uh don't send us bills
 
03:52:59.389 --> 03:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
that have the expenditure of money
 
03:53:02.149 --> 03:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
without the appropriation of money so
 
03:53:04.309 --> 03:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's okay to spend money as long as you
 
03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
designate that there is an appropriation
 
03:53:12.349 --> 03:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
made uh for some amount uh and but this
 
03:53:14.830 --> 03:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that this this legisl
 
03:53:17.710 --> 03:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
has written does not appropriate any
 
03:53:17.720 --> 03:53:18.950 align:start position:0%
has written does not appropriate any
funds

03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:53:21.269 --> 03:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
whatsoever okay so are there other
 
03:53:23.349 --> 03:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative Harrington has
 
03:53:25.389 --> 03:53:25.399 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question just to follow up on
 
03:53:30.349 --> 03:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
that idea uh you it specifies having a
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
director of climate change and damage
 
03:53:35.189 --> 03:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to conceive that we're
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to establish a new division in
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
Dees with just a director and no one
 
03:53:42.790 --> 03:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
that works for them it's going to be a
 
03:53:44.750 --> 03:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
single person so I I would assume if
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
this would have passed we're looking at
 
03:53:49.110 --> 03:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know three four five new new people
 
03:53:51.070 --> 03:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh could be one could be just you're
 
03:53:52.630 --> 03:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to have a director
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
with nobody that works for him in charge
 
03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
of a division of one person no I'm
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
saying a a director um although I mean a
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
director could be a a committee I mean
 
03:54:04.269 --> 03:54:04.279 align:start position:0%
depending how much they do but um at
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
least one employee under the director is
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
is I
 
03:54:11.469 --> 03:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
think reasonable all right thank
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
Thomas for introducing this legislation
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
next I'd like to hear from Mike
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald from the Department of
 
03:54:27.870 --> 03:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to get their
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.990 --> 03:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislation welcome Mr Fitzgerald nice
 
03:54:37.510 --> 03:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much appreciate that
 
03:54:42.550 --> 03:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh Mike Fitzgerald Department of
 
03:54:43.910 --> 03:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services assistant
 
03:54:46.870 --> 03:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
director the air Resources Division uh
 
03:54:49.389 --> 03:54:49.399 align:start position:0%
currently responsible for uh the work
 
03:54:51.990 --> 03:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we're doing in climate uh I do want
 
03:54:54.590 --> 03:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
to correct one misconception that uh we
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
did the assistant commissioner did sign
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note and it was sent down last
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
week uh he signed it on the 7th I don't
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
know exactly when it went down it's
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that it was uh uh not
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
reflected here but I wrote the note so
 
03:55:10.990 --> 03:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to answer questions on it
 
03:55:14.070 --> 03:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
and uh I I will summarize by saying that
 
03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
as was so so surmised we assumed that
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
this would require an additional at
 
03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
least one additional position um there
 
03:55:21.910 --> 03:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
are a number of activities that are
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
noted here that um we're already uh
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
undertaking uh and specifically section
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
one um paragraph one beginning on uh uh
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
line 11 the adaptation planning work a
 
03:55:38.149 --> 03:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
lot of that work is already being done
 
03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
with the SE Coast hazards risk uh
 
03:55:43.590 --> 03:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
commission and um working with a number
 
03:55:45.950 --> 03:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
of Upper Valley has an adaptation work
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
group um so uh and we are also uh
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
utilizing uh our federal SE climate
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
pollution reduction grant that I uh uh
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
showed spoke to you about last week when
 
03:56:02.790 --> 03:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
we presented to you um and I have three
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
staff working on that Grant
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
currently uh my concern is uh that that
 
03:56:11.830 --> 03:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
Grant will will last maybe for another
 
03:56:15.389 --> 03:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
two years um and uh
 
03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
um the uh work that's required here is
 
03:56:24.149 --> 03:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
is ongoing so uh as uh you you and
 
03:56:27.990 --> 03:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas recognized um the
 
03:56:31.790 --> 03:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
we would need a a director uh I'm not
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
sure if that title just means director
 
03:56:35.510 --> 03:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
of climate change but it's a staff level
 
03:56:37.469 --> 03:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
if it's a director it would be unusual
 
03:56:41.469 --> 03:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
that it be um that there'd be no staff
 
03:56:45.149 --> 03:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
um under it uh and direct and a director
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
is an appointed position um typically
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
and so um and the work that's noted in
 
03:56:55.269 --> 03:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph two here is extremely highly
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
Technical and complex in nature um
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
research and data analysis conducting
 
03:57:02.510 --> 03:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
climate modeling and scenario planning
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
Etc so we estimated that this would
 
03:57:07.110 --> 03:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
probably take an additional two or three
 
03:57:12.070 --> 03:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
staff um uh and again some some of this
 
03:57:13.710 --> 03:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
you know is is work that's already being
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
done so we you know could assimilate
 
03:57:19.229 --> 03:57:19.239 align:start position:0%
some of it but U uh certainly the fiscal
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
note did indicate that we felt we would
 
03:57:22.990 --> 03:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
need additional staff that was not
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
authorized by the
 
03:57:27.149 --> 03:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
bill so with that I'd be happy to take
 
03:57:27.159 --> 03:57:28.590 align:start position:0%
bill so with that I'd be happy to take
any

03:57:28.590 --> 03:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:57:31.630 --> 03:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
questions could
 
03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
you define for us or describe for us the
 
03:57:37.870 --> 03:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
difference between an
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
unclassified position within state
 
03:57:42.750 --> 03:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
government and a classified position
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
well classified I believe is subject to
 
03:57:47.710 --> 03:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
the Personnel Personnel rules and is is
 
03:57:50.030 --> 03:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
hired through the state system
 
03:57:53.229 --> 03:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
unclassified would be for instance I'm
 
03:57:56.070 --> 03:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
classified um I'm an assistant director
 
03:57:58.870 --> 03:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
the director of the division is
 
03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
nominated by the governor and approved
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
by the council um and those are
 
03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:05.550 align:start position:0%
by the council um and those are
unclassified

03:58:05.550 --> 03:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
unclassified
 
03:58:08.510 --> 03:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
positions okay so it's a position that
 
03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
requires approval by the governor and
 
03:58:12.429 --> 03:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
the executive Council nomination by the
 
03:58:14.229 --> 03:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
governor and approval of the council
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you for that I
 
03:58:18.910 --> 03:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
think the wording that's in here is is
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
pro probably was intended to reflect
 
03:58:23.149 --> 03:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
that but I think it just came came out
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
wrong but it's it's uh I think they're
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
working on a thousand bills over there
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
so I I'll give them some
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
slack okay representative Summers has a
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh this
 
03:58:40.110 --> 03:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
actually just ties to a bunch of things
 
03:58:42.910 --> 03:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
that just happened recently and I'm I
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
kind of concerned or question about some
 
03:58:47.030 --> 03:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the items and especially when it
 
03:58:50.229 --> 03:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
comes to the uh the change and damage
 
03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
part and uh with the um the T testimony
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the um EPA the person's
 
03:59:00.429 --> 03:59:00.439 align:start position:0%
running for the Secretary of EPA as well
 
03:59:02.830 --> 03:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
as the Secretary of United Nations has
 
03:59:05.830 --> 03:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
stated that the uh that there's a and
 
03:59:08.349 --> 03:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
with the um executive order signed
 
03:59:10.590 --> 03:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
Yesterday by President Trump for all
 
03:59:13.630 --> 03:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
above approach uh how would the um the
 
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
fact of doing this with a change and
 
03:59:19.670 --> 03:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
damage coincide with with climate change
 
03:59:21.070 --> 03:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
and with the damage caused by fossil
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
fuels how would it coincide with the
 
03:59:25.469 --> 03:59:25.479 align:start position:0%
with them stating that there's an all
 
03:59:28.830 --> 03:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
above approach for the uh for the
 
03:59:30.750 --> 03:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
government well I think we take our
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
direction from the governor so we would
 
03:59:35.790 --> 03:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh it would you know we're an
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency within the state
 
03:59:42.269 --> 03:59:42.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire U the federal uh
 
03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
approach if you're talking about EPA
 
03:59:47.229 --> 03:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
funds and funding um which as I said we
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
do have a cprg grant if they change
 
03:59:52.389 --> 03:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
direction on that Grant policy we would
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
we would follow that the only work that
 
03:59:57.630 --> 03:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
we are doing on climate mitigation not
 
04:00:01.389 --> 04:00:01.399 align:start position:0%
adaptation but climate mitigation is uh
 
04:00:04.349 --> 04:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
related to developing a climate plan uh
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned in the presentation I
 
04:00:09.790 --> 04:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
gave you last week um and and so if the
 
04:00:11.870 --> 04:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
administration were to change direction
 
04:00:14.229 --> 04:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
on that we would follow whatever ever
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
policies were given to us with regards
 
04:00:19.309 --> 04:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
to a state of New Hampshire position
 
04:00:21.389 --> 04:00:21.399 align:start position:0%
under state government that would be at
 
04:00:23.149 --> 04:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
the direction of the governor and the
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:28.790 --> 04:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
agency representative Corman has a
 
04:00:30.750 --> 04:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:00:32.510 --> 04:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
for taking this very simple question
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
usually when we have an agency come here
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
for a bill such as this we get a support
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
opposer neutral I haven't heard anything
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:48.189 --> 04:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
04:00:50.830 --> 04:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Fitzgerald um the
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
section you didn't mention was section
 
04:00:54.750 --> 04:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
three on line 25 where it says public
 
04:00:56.910 --> 04:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
engagement in education including
 
04:00:58.870 --> 04:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
leading awareness campaigns to educate
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
citizens and working with local
 
04:01:02.950 --> 04:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
communities to develop initiatives that
 
04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
address uh climate change at the local
 
04:01:06.990 --> 04:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
level what I wanted to ask you about
 
04:01:10.590 --> 04:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
that is um myself and chairman Vose were
 
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
members for about four years on the easy
 
04:01:15.590 --> 04:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
board which is since has been dissolved
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
and we were in the process of procuring
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh a public awareness campaign around
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and some other aspects
 
04:01:27.550 --> 04:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
of lowering emissions um and that got
 
04:01:30.870 --> 04:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
moved over to the Department of energy
 
04:01:33.429 --> 04:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
and I think part of the uh part of this
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill and some other efforts I have seen
 
04:01:38.349 --> 04:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
are to figure out where does the buck
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
stop and where does how do the agencies
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
of government cover
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh this piece in terms of support for
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
the public so we know that the
 
04:01:50.910 --> 04:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services is
 
04:01:53.309 --> 04:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for the pollution piece and
 
04:01:56.349 --> 04:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
you also are responsible for tracking
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas init
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
initiative numbers and money coming into
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
the state uh from that
 
04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
program but is there some confusion
 
04:02:08.110 --> 04:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
around I I I think this bill is trying
 
04:02:12.990 --> 04:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify where uh ownership would lie
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
for anything Rel related to um climate
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
damages and costs coming into the into
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state so is there any
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't know what the right
 
04:02:26.990 --> 04:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
word would be is there any lack of
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
clarity around who owns this
 
04:02:34.229 --> 04:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
piece is it straddling two agencies
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
because I know that you used to have
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
someone who had climate in their title
 
04:02:40.590 --> 04:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
um Chris scogland when I first came into
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature he was the person that
 
04:02:44.149 --> 04:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
would come into this room and talk to us
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
about those programs so is has anyone
 
04:02:49.630 --> 04:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
taken over his role in your agency maybe
 
04:02:51.630 --> 04:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
that's a better way to answer it the
 
04:02:53.309 --> 04:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
position that was currently that was
 
04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
previously held by Mr scogland is
 
04:02:57.149 --> 04:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
currently staffed by someone working
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
under the climate pollution reduction
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
Grant um we we shifted the funding on
 
04:03:06.189 --> 04:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
that okay um and uh our work on Reggie
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
is is funded by Reggie um that comes
 
04:03:11.630 --> 04:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
comes from the administration portion of
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
that with regard to Clarity or not un
 
04:03:16.510 --> 04:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
Clarity um currently there are no State
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
statutes that address climate change um
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
and so we have no other than the fact
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
that we accepted a Federal grant which
 
04:03:27.550 --> 04:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
we consulted with the governor's office
 
04:03:32.429 --> 04:03:32.439 align:start position:0%
on previously um we uh and that was to
 
04:03:34.510 --> 04:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
enable us as you I mentioned last week
 
04:03:36.149 --> 04:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
that was to enable us to be able to
 
04:03:38.510 --> 04:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
apply for $4.5 billion dollar in federal
 
04:03:41.550 --> 04:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
funding um of which we did receive a
 
04:03:44.349 --> 04:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
$450 million five state
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
Grant we for the heat pump accelerator
 
04:03:51.269 --> 04:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
program um but uh other than that there
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
is no State funding and no State
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
authorization to address climate change
 
04:03:58.910 --> 04:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and we're doing all all the work that
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing on climate is currently
 
04:04:03.790 --> 04:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
being done under the opes of that
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
funding and we're doing a a a climate
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
plan and a number of the things that are
 
04:04:11.149 --> 04:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
addressed in section three um are being
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
done stakeholder Outreach education we
 
04:04:15.149 --> 04:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
working with the University of New
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Etc but all under the opes of
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
that um that Federal grant so followup
 
04:04:24.670 --> 04:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
followup so I guess then the last
 
04:04:27.990 --> 04:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
question would be if if this bill or an
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
amended version to this bill were to
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
pass would you be able to reconstitute
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
your existing resources in order to meet
 
04:04:40.149 --> 04:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
the requirements of of having someone
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
who's playing point on this or would it
 
04:04:45.550 --> 04:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
still require and additional people to
 
04:04:45.560 --> 04:04:46.750 align:start position:0%
still require and additional people to
be

04:04:46.750 --> 04:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:04:50.910 --> 04:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
added well again uh we I I have four
 
04:04:52.830 --> 04:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
staff that are currently working on cprg
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
grant that are they're doing some of
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
this we have some staff in our Water
 
04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
Division who are working on the
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
adaptation side of this and so on so we
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
would need to sit down do an
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
assessment making make a determination
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
of what we think the bill directed us to
 
04:05:10.110 --> 04:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
do obviously work with the governor's
 
04:05:14.189 --> 04:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
office relative to to Staffing and and
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
budget uh constraints and uh but I'm I
 
04:05:21.389 --> 04:05:21.399 align:start position:0%
would say of of all of the items that
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
are in this bill the area that concerns
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
me is section two um regarding the
 
04:05:28.630 --> 04:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
research and Analysis so on that would
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
require a couple of one or two certainly
 
04:05:33.630 --> 04:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
one or two new positions or some
 
04:05:36.510 --> 04:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
repurposing of the federal positions but
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
again when that Federal money goes away
 
04:05:41.590 --> 04:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
there would need to be State money to to
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh authorize that and State State you
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
know I mean this this bill would need to
 
04:05:49.830 --> 04:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
pass so representative Kaplan has a
 
04:05:51.870 --> 04:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr fit for coming in um I and I want
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
to express my appreciation for the work
 
04:05:58.349 --> 04:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
that you're doing on the climate action
 
04:06:00.750 --> 04:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
plan and uh in terms of resilience work
 
04:06:02.349 --> 04:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
with the different uh Regional
 
04:06:06.830 --> 04:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
development um bodies so um
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
understanding that all of this is in
 
04:06:11.229 --> 04:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
play in terms of the politics involved
 
04:06:12.990 --> 04:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh the in in terms of the funding that's
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
available uh but irregardless of that if
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass it's just on a
 
04:06:21.389 --> 04:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
theoretical conceptual level would you
 
04:06:23.630 --> 04:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
do you see a benefit to the work that is
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
being done in terms of resilience in
 
04:06:27.070 --> 04:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
terms of education and taking taking
 
04:06:28.870 --> 04:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
away the research piece and the analysis
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
piece because I do recognize that that
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
might not be in your in your Bailey Wick
 
04:06:35.830 --> 04:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
so to speak um do you see a benefit to
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
this bill in terms of furthering the
 
04:06:39.790 --> 04:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
work that is being
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
done yes we certainly believe it is an
 
04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
area that there's
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
um uh education and and uh uh providing
 
04:06:52.110 --> 04:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
um some some leadership um again that
 
04:06:55.229 --> 04:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
would be at the direction
 
04:06:59.110 --> 04:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
of the legislature if this bill were to
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
pass and um under the implementation of
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
yes all right thank you seeing no
 
04:07:11.469 --> 04:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
further questions I want to thank Mr
 
04:07:11.479 --> 04:07:13.710 align:start position:0%
further questions I want to thank Mr
fritzgerald

04:07:13.710 --> 04:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
fritzgerald
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
you got to raise your hand faster than
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
that representative partial has a
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and thank you
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
for coming today I appreciate your time
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
here thank you um is it possible to uh
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
have your the fiscal note we submitted
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the OSS shared with the committee it
 
04:07:31.469 --> 04:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
to my best of my knowledge it has been
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
submitted to Ls I'm not sure when this
 
04:07:36.189 --> 04:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
was printed and and so on and it they
 
04:07:38.590 --> 04:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
they may have crossed paths but um it
 
04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
was signed by our assistant commissioner
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
on the 7th of
 
04:07:43.870 --> 04:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
January check the calendar
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative partial because I recall
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
seeing one of those boxes that they put
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the calendar that notifies us when
 
04:07:56.429 --> 04:07:56.439 align:start position:0%
new fiscal notes are available and I
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
think it gives us a way to access those
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
physical notes I'll take a look there
 
04:08:01.630 --> 04:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that information
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
check that out thank you all right thank
 
04:08:05.469 --> 04:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr Fitzgerald next up we'll hear
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
from Nick Koff of the conservation law
 
04:08:08.279 --> 04:08:26.349 align:start position:0%
from Nick Koff of the conservation law
Foundation

04:08:26.349 --> 04:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Nick coff senior
 
04:08:29.550 --> 04:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
attorney with the conservation law
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
Foundation um thanks again for having me
 
04:08:35.229 --> 04:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
here today really appreciate it um you
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
know I was here last week and I talked a
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
lot about the um climate change and sort
 
04:08:42.109 --> 04:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
of the defects we're realizing from
 
04:08:44.510 --> 04:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
climate change over the past several
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
decades um you know climate change is
 
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
and will continue to affect the state's
 
04:08:52.349 --> 04:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
economy its infrastructure and its
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
ecosystems and um the committee should
 
04:08:56.429 --> 04:08:56.439 align:start position:0%
really pass this bill in order to
 
04:08:59.109 --> 04:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
establish a division within Dees um to
 
04:09:00.910 --> 04:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
further study the issue to study the
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
impacts to the state and to um plan on
 
04:09:07.469 --> 04:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
how to adapt to the to the issue um you
 
04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
know as I talked about last week we're
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
seeing shorter and warmer Winters in the
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
state this is affecting um winter
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
Recreation Industries throughout the
 
04:09:18.189 --> 04:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
state um we're experiencing rising sea
 
04:09:18.199 --> 04:09:20.429 align:start position:0%
state um we're experiencing rising sea
levels

04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
levels
 
04:09:23.109 --> 04:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
um in the in since the beginning of the
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
um 20th century sea levels have Ren 8
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
Ines already and are expected to rise
 
04:09:30.990 --> 04:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
even further over the coming decades um
 
04:09:32.590 --> 04:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
and this is affecting properties and the
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast Area um you know really
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
affecting people's livelihoods there and
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
businesses in the Sea Coast um as it's
 
04:09:42.830 --> 04:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
um exacerbating extreme weather in that
 
04:09:42.840 --> 04:09:44.349 align:start position:0%
um exacerbating extreme weather in that
area

04:09:44.349 --> 04:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
um you know we're also
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
seeing uh pretty significant effects for
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
our Wildlife um with the moose
 
04:09:54.429 --> 04:09:54.439 align:start position:0%
population it's worsening um you know
 
04:09:56.189 --> 04:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
with the winter tick situation which is
 
04:09:58.189 --> 04:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
really decimating our moose population
 
04:10:01.149 --> 04:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
in the state and you know just going out
 
04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
the woods these days you really have to
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
worry about ticks this wasn't a thing 30
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
years ago but you know going for a hike
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
nowadays it's it's a real issue um so
 
04:10:12.510 --> 04:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
consolidating all of de's activities
 
04:10:14.429 --> 04:10:14.439 align:start position:0%
into a single division that can um
 
04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
further study the issue and figure out
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
how to better adapt to climate change is
 
04:10:22.349 --> 04:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
really needed um right now um you know
 
04:10:23.429 --> 04:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
given the effects that are happening in
 
04:10:26.670 --> 04:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
the state and you know for those reasons
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
I think uh you should vote a to pass on
 
04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and happy to take your
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions I've um submitted written
 
04:10:34.670 --> 04:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that provide more detail as
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you representative
 
04:10:40.030 --> 04:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
Summers has a question thank you Mr
 
04:10:41.790 --> 04:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:10:45.309 --> 04:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
question uh to uh last week's testimony
 
04:10:47.229 --> 04:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
especially with the EPA this came from
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate environmental um Senate board
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
federally where it stated that Western
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
Europe and the United States create or
 
04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
produce about 15% of the uh CO2 within
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
the within the world environment uh with
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
remaining especially in Asia Asia and
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
developing countries developed 85% so
 
04:11:11.950 --> 04:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
even if the United States completely New
 
04:11:13.950 --> 04:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire went to zero United States
 
04:11:16.349 --> 04:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
went to completely zero would this have
 
04:11:18.990 --> 04:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
a small effect compared to 85% of the
 
04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
rest of the pollution being caused
 
04:11:23.189 --> 04:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
supposed pollution caused by the rest of
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
the world outside the US well um this
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill is thanks thank you for the
 
04:11:28.269 --> 04:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
question but this bill is all about
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
climate change adaptation and not
 
04:11:31.950 --> 04:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation so it's not seeking to solve
 
04:11:33.070 --> 04:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of climate change it's seeing
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
to figure out how we adapt to that issue
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
so regardless of who's causing climate
 
04:11:38.990 --> 04:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
change um you know which which countries
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
are more um contributing more to the
 
04:11:42.670 --> 04:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
issue this is really trying to figure
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
out how does the State adapt to the
 
04:11:46.349 --> 04:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
changes that we're seeing so you know
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
what do we do to respond to rising sea
 
04:11:50.429 --> 04:11:50.439 align:start position:0%
levels What do we do to um you know
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
protect our moose population it's not
 
04:11:53.710 --> 04:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
really seeking to you know reverse that
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
Trend or or stop the trend of climate
 
04:12:00.750 --> 04:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
change followup so I guess I'm asking is
 
04:12:03.389 --> 04:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
H is it the financial responsibility of
 
04:12:07.229 --> 04:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
the West to spend it spend into Infinity
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of money to Halt climate
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
change when 85% of the environments
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
caused by outside of the
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
West I mean that's a very valid question
 
04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
um but you know I think if you look at
 
04:12:22.109 --> 04:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
the overall levels of CO2 um in the
 
04:12:23.950 --> 04:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
atmosphere basically starting from the
 
04:12:27.109 --> 04:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
Industrial Revolution when we started um
 
04:12:29.309 --> 04:12:29.319 align:start position:0%
you know emitting CO2 into the air you
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
know Western countries have been
 
04:12:32.590 --> 04:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for a large portion of that
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
amount so regardless of who's you know
 
04:12:38.109 --> 04:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
emitting more CO2 now um You the the
 
04:12:40.630 --> 04:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
overall level um Western countries have
 
04:12:43.229 --> 04:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
been you know responsible but you know I
 
04:12:47.950 --> 04:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
I think regardless of that you know I'm
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
not saying that we need to spend
 
04:12:53.149 --> 04:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
infinite an infinite amount um I think
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
the better way to look at it is you know
 
04:12:57.109 --> 04:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
we need to start planning you know a how
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
to reduce the effects of climate change
 
04:13:01.630 --> 04:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
if we can and be how to adapt to those
 
04:13:04.990 --> 04:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
those um you know those impacts and
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
basically the sooner we start thinking
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
about that you know the less money we're
 
04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to have to spend and the longer we
 
04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
weight um you know the more financial
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
cost it'll be
 
04:13:16.510 --> 04:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and yeah to bring
 
04:13:22.349 --> 04:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
the um questioning and Responding back
 
04:13:26.309 --> 04:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
to what this bill is actually about we
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
heard a lot last week in our briefings
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
about the to me very surprising number
 
04:13:33.840 --> 04:13:34.870 align:start position:0%
about the to me very surprising number
of

04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
dams on our waterways throughout the
 
04:13:41.550 --> 04:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
state some of which are involved in
 
04:13:43.469 --> 04:13:43.479 align:start position:0%
producing hydrop power but many many of
 
04:13:45.149 --> 04:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
which just
 
04:13:47.550 --> 04:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
provide you know Environmental Services
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
flood control and frankly a lot of
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
economic uh benefit in terms of
 
04:13:59.830 --> 04:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:04.109 --> 04:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh the uh that increasing
 
04:14:06.910 --> 04:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
um frequency of you know High
 
04:14:09.870 --> 04:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
precipitation events is one of those
 
04:14:11.830 --> 04:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
significant climate impacts that we're
 
04:14:14.910 --> 04:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
seeing and wouldn't this position in
 
04:14:18.750 --> 04:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
Dees gathering information and forecasts
 
04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
and talk and providing information about
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
that effect isn't that one of the things
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
that uh one of the benefits that this
 
04:14:28.030 --> 04:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
position in Dees would have yeah
 
04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean I um you know if you
 
04:14:33.429 --> 04:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
look at Summer of 2023 there was a you
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
know some big storms in the Upper Valley
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
and you know there there was a dam or
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
two that got washed out that summer and
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah one of the goals of this bill or
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
objectives of this bill would be to you
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
know look at you know how climate change
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
is affecting infrastructure and how do
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
we adapt to that you know do we need to
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
make upgrades infrastructure do we need
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
to you know make certain changes so that
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know that that infrastructure is is
 
04:14:58.109 --> 04:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.429 --> 04:15:00.439 align:start position:0%
essentially okay further
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank

Lebanon uh I have introduced an
 
04:16:25.710 --> 04:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
amendment uh as chair Vose informed us
 
04:16:28.109 --> 04:16:28.119 align:start position:0%
last week the prime sponsor of a bill
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
May introduce an amendment at the
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm I have introduced an
 
04:16:34.429 --> 04:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
amendment uh members all have it it is
 
04:16:34.439 --> 04:16:41.830 align:start position:0%
amendment uh members all have it it is
number

04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:44.149 --> 04:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
2025-the which I hope the amendment
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
makes very clear is that any action
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
taken by the public utilities
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner should require the support
 
04:16:54.990 --> 04:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
of at least two of the three
 
04:16:57.070 --> 04:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners a little
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
background RSA 363 which is about the Pu
 
04:17:05.870 --> 04:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh 363 colon one says and I am going to
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
quote the chair of the commission shall
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
have the powers and duties set forth in
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
RSA 21g colon n unquote so these powers
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
in that RSA are intended for the
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
commissioners of
 
04:17:24.189 --> 04:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
departments and if you look at RSA 21 G9
 
04:17:26.189 --> 04:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
it says the commissioner shall be the
 
04:17:28.149 --> 04:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
chief administrative officer of the
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
department and shall have the following
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
powers and duties and listed among those
 
04:17:37.269 --> 04:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
powers and duties in par in uh section n
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2B it says adopt all rules of
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
the department whether the rule making
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
Authority delegated by the legislature
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
is granted to the commissioner the
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
department or any administrative unit or
 
04:17:52.710 --> 04:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
subordinate official of the department
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
unquote so this language that's in
 
04:17:58.830 --> 04:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
statute gives the Pu chair the power to
 
04:18:01.590 --> 04:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
set all the rules independent of what
 
04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
the other two Commissioners
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
think I don't know whether this is what
 
04:18:09.070 --> 04:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
the legisl intended but it means that
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
the other two Commissioners may be
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
ignored by the Pu chair at least that's
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
the way I read it I don't think that's
 
04:18:17.550 --> 04:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
really what the legislature intended and
 
04:18:20.830 --> 04:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
what we wanted so the bill that I have
 
04:18:24.030 --> 04:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
submitted simply says that any action
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
taken by the Pu must be agreed to by at
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
least two of the Commissioners and the
 
04:18:30.910 --> 04:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
amendment makes that crystal clear it
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
says uh two Commissioners shall
 
04:18:35.950 --> 04:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
constitute a quorum to hold a hearing
 
04:18:38.349 --> 04:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
and issue orders or establish rules or
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
both uh actually oh it's different wait
 
04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
a minute this is different from what I
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
had here um it says two Commissioners
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
shall constitute a quorum regardless of
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
any vacancies this changed from uh my
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
com my uh communication with OS a quorum
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
is required for the commission to
 
04:18:57.630 --> 04:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
conduct any authorized proceeding or
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
take any actions so the point is it
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that you need two
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to actually agree on an
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
action by the Pu the chair alone is not
 
04:19:11.469 --> 04:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
sufficient so if there is a vacancy on
 
04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
the Pu and this is what the fiscal note
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill got to if there's a vacancy
 
04:19:18.550 --> 04:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
on the Pu then the two remaining
 
04:19:20.910 --> 04:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would need to agree if
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
there were two vacancies on the Pu then
 
04:19:26.990 --> 04:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
no action should be taken by the
 
04:19:29.950 --> 04:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
commission um until at least there's one
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
new commissioner appointed by the
 
04:19:33.510 --> 04:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive Council and
 
04:19:34.630 --> 04:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's really the way it should be I
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
mean if there's just one person left
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a commission that's one
 
04:19:42.030 --> 04:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
person so I don't even think there was a
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
need for fiscal note on this bill I
 
04:19:46.389 --> 04:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
don't think any special commissioner on
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
retainer is needed and I actually think
 
04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced was misunderstood
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
because in the original bill it talked
 
04:19:57.149 --> 04:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
about at least 2third of the commission
 
04:19:59.149 --> 04:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of any
 
04:19:59.159 --> 04:20:01.590 align:start position:0%
regardless of any
vacancies

04:20:01.590 --> 04:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
04:20:04.830 --> 04:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
now I think I know a little bit about
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
mathematics I'm the lead author of a
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
very technical textbook on computer
 
04:20:11.670 --> 04:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
algorithms and when I think of what at
 
04:20:15.070 --> 04:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
least two 23 of three means that means
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
at least two so they there doesn't need
 
04:20:21.550 --> 04:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
to be a commissioner on retainer to fill
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
out a third position two should suffice
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think there even needs to
 
04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
be a fiscal note here if the commission
 
04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
is down by one person the two remaining
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
need to agree if the commission is down
 
04:20:35.229 --> 04:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
by two people there has to be at least
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
one more person appointed if the
 
04:20:38.670 --> 04:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
commission is down three people WOTE to
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
us so uh with that um I will take any
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for introducing this
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and this
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
amendment so let's assume
 
04:20:59.590 --> 04:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
that two pu Commissioners resign health
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
reasons moving out of state whatever so
 
04:21:07.229 --> 04:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
there's only one commissioner
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
left the governor needs to nominate two
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
new Commissioners and then they have to
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
be appr vetted and approved by the
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
executive councel both of those things
 
04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
could take
 
04:21:21.870 --> 04:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
months does that mean if your bill
 
04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
passed would that mean that the Pu would
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
essentially its activity would grind to
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
a halt until those two new Commissioners
 
04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
were appointed and the executive Council
 
04:21:34.840 --> 04:21:36.229 align:start position:0%
were appointed and the executive Council
approved

04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
approved
 
04:21:39.269 --> 04:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
them since the the commission would not
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
have a quorum and could not conduct any
 
04:21:41.399 --> 04:21:43.510 align:start position:0%
have a quorum and could not conduct any
business

04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case what would happen
 
04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:48.119 align:start position:0%
to the other 13 14 employees of the
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
commission would they be furl would
 
04:21:55.630 --> 04:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
they just sit around and twiddle their
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
thumbs what what would happen describe
 
04:21:59.790 --> 04:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
to us under that scenario what would
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
happen well I would imagine and I'm I'm
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
certainly not um an expert on how the Pu
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
operates internally I would imagine
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's still plenty of work that gets
 
04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
done internally uh within the the Pu
 
04:22:15.469 --> 04:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
regardless of of how many Commissioners
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
are there but the main thing is it is
 
04:22:19.269 --> 04:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the governor and the
 
04:22:22.269 --> 04:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
council to to do that job to actually
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
get somebody on there and if the
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
governor drags their feet or if the
 
04:22:30.149 --> 04:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
council drags their feet then uh in in
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
the scenario where there's zero or one
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner the state's suffering and
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
that means that the governor and councel
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
done well my follow-up question would
 
04:22:49.630 --> 04:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
be it's not only the Pu that would
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
suffer but all the states rate payers
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
would suffer the state's utilities would
 
04:22:58.469 --> 04:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
suffer it seems to me that work would
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
would grind to a total halt under that
 
04:23:03.790 --> 04:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
scenario and that would not be a good
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
thing for our state is that not the case
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I actually agree with you
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
entirely it would be terrible for the
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
work to grind to a halt uh that's why
 
04:23:16.030 --> 04:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
they need to actually make sure that it
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
is staffed and as soon as one
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner is gone resigns or whatever
 
04:23:22.229 --> 04:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
they need to actually work on getting
 
04:23:26.670 --> 04:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
another one but more to the point a
 
04:23:29.630 --> 04:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner does not make a commission
 
04:23:32.189 --> 04:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
the commission is
 
04:23:35.189 --> 04:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
statutorily uh composed of three
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and one commissioner is
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
not a
 
04:23:42.469 --> 04:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
commission okay additional question
 
04:23:44.590 --> 04:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
04:23:44.600 --> 04:23:48.550 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
representative

04:23:48.550 --> 04:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
Swanson it isn't spelled out in here but
 
04:23:52.000 --> 04:23:52.830 align:start position:0%
Swanson it isn't spelled out in here but
is

04:23:52.830 --> 04:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:23:57.109 --> 04:23:57.119 align:start position:0%
it would it be practical to have say an
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
interim or system or process wherein
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
there would be an interim appointment
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
until there could actually be a physical
 
04:24:06.070 --> 04:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
action on the part of the governor
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
governor uh given how long you know
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy takes to make things happen
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes when a vacancy occurs
 
04:24:16.830 --> 04:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly I don't know the answer to
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
that and I don't know if um anyone from
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
the puc is going to
 
04:24:24.670 --> 04:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
testify um I would imagine that the
 
04:24:29.229 --> 04:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
amount of of background needed to be on
 
04:24:29.239 --> 04:24:30.030 align:start position:0%
amount of of background needed to be on
the

04:24:30.030 --> 04:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
Pu could make it a little difficult
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps there could be somebody who had
 
04:24:37.229 --> 04:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
been on the Pu stepping in
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
that uh the fiscal note there if that
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
person were in fact drawing some sort of
 
04:24:48.510 --> 04:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
compensation well there's compensation
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
not going to the to the person who's not
 
04:24:52.510 --> 04:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
there so again I don't see that it would
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
be a big um fiscal
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
problem uh I'm not suggesting anybody be
 
04:25:00.189 --> 04:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
on retainer and I don't know if you are
 
04:25:02.710 --> 04:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
but you know I just think that perhaps
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
somebody could step in uh temporarily
 
04:25:08.070 --> 04:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
but somebody you know who's been on on
 
04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
the commission before thank you Mr chair
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman
 
04:25:12.880 --> 04:25:14.469 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman
further

04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative rolds thank you
 
04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Tom for being here
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
I mean in just briefly would you
 
04:25:29.389 --> 04:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
characterize your bill uh
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
clarifying that there needs to be at
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
least two at least a majority of a
 
04:25:38.670 --> 04:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
commission uh to exist at all times uh
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
to take action would would you
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
characterize it as a good government
 
04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
bill I mean in bodies that are
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
constituted in uh odd numbers three five
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
like Boards of Selectmen and City
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
councils uh that regularly hold votes
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
where it takes a a majority to make a
 
04:26:05.269 --> 04:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
decision uh you're just clarifying
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
aren't you just clarifying that there
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be enough
 
04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
members to hold a vote
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
that that's part of it but also
 
04:26:20.349 --> 04:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying that uh the way that RSA 363
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
colon one says that the chair of the
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
commission has the powers and duties set
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
forth in RSA 21g col 9 and that that
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
actually gives the chair of the Pu the
 
04:26:35.790 --> 04:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
powers that a a commissioner of a
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
department has and I don't think that's
 
04:26:45.070 --> 04:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
so is your real
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
objection the fact
 
04:26:55.990 --> 04:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
that as currently worded state law in uh
 
04:26:56.000 --> 04:26:57.550 align:start position:0%
that as currently worded state law in uh
21

04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
21
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
g9b allows a single commissioner to
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
adopt rules is that the the Crux of the
 
04:27:07.870 --> 04:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
issue here even though jel car has to
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
approve those rules and if the
 
04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner adopted rules that gel car
 
04:27:17.550 --> 04:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
and its
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
process didn't think were
 
04:27:24.429 --> 04:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
acceptable those rules wouldn't go
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
forward yeah I still think that there
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
should be at least two Commissioners on
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Pu this is why we have the Pu it's
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
three it should be three people and
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
there should be at least two who adopt a
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
rule representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um you may
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
not have the ansers to this question but
 
04:27:45.710 --> 04:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
I'm intrigued by the fiscal note that
 
04:27:49.469 --> 04:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
says that a um a special commissioner
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
would start at 1
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
15,850 do you know is that the starting
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
salary for a
 
04:28:01.429 --> 04:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.990 --> 04:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative
 
04:28:06.830 --> 04:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I'm still a little
 
04:28:08.990 --> 04:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
confused about what this is trying to
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish U looking at the bill before
 
04:28:14.429 --> 04:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
it was change your your bill here with
 
04:28:16.269 --> 04:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
the if you take out the what was changed
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
it says the commission shall any
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission which is we
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
know is since it's three it's two
 
04:28:24.990 --> 04:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
constitutes a quorum to issue orders and
 
04:28:27.109 --> 04:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
any hearing may be held or conducted by
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners or by a single
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I guess what you're
 
04:28:34.030 --> 04:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
saying that that was lined out so you're
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
saying in this chapter majority means at
 
04:28:37.790 --> 04:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
least 2third of the commission
 
04:28:40.269 --> 04:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of any
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
vacancies so what you're trying to
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
clarify there that is if there was only
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners because one resigned
 
04:28:49.149 --> 04:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
that you'd you you'd have to have 2third
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
of the full commissioner meeting two at
 
04:28:53.790 --> 04:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
all times is the minimum amount correct
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
that was my intention and and I think it
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
was not interpreted in that way in the
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal note okay
 
04:29:03.109 --> 04:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
followup yes but so what this is saying
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
you could have one commissioner would be
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
for a hearing but they couldn't issue
 
04:29:06.800 --> 04:29:08.149 align:start position:0%
for a hearing but they couldn't issue
any

04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
orders and there's also the uh provision
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the law La that anybody that wants a
 
04:29:17.790 --> 04:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
no hearing except in accident cases
 
04:29:19.550 --> 04:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
shall be held or conducted by a single
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner if any party whose interest
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
may be affected shall five days before
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
the date request in writing the be
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
commission to be conducted by a full
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner or a majority thereof so if
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
there was a hearing and somebody even
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
even the hearing now they can't issue
 
04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
orders that's already established but if
 
04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
there was a hearing and someone was
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
involved in that hearing they could say
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want one commissioner I want
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
at least two and they would have to get
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
at least two that's the present
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
law um well I think the present law says
 
04:29:51.950 --> 04:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
that a hearing can be conducted by a
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
single commissioner right that's that's
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's the part that that we
 
04:30:00.149 --> 04:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
would be St St stricken out a followup
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
if you go to
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
3627 it talks about requests for a full
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
commission it's a it's a separate
 
04:30:10.109 --> 04:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
section and in there it says no hearing
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
except in accident cases they be held or
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
conducted by a single commissioner if
 
04:30:16.349 --> 04:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
any party whose interest may be affected
 
04:30:18.510 --> 04:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
shall 5 days prior to the date of the
 
04:30:20.670 --> 04:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
hearing request in writing that the same
 
04:30:22.109 --> 04:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
be held to conducted by the full
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
commission or a majority thereof so
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
anybody that wants to could say one
 
04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
commission is not good enough you you
 
04:30:30.429 --> 04:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
don't you don't think that protects
 
04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
people enough and this is just for a
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
hearing now they still couldn't you
 
04:30:35.710 --> 04:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't issue an order with one right
 
04:30:38.710 --> 04:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
right but yeah I mean I I'm I'm I'm not
 
04:30:38.720 --> 04:30:39.590 align:start position:0%
right but yeah I mean I I'm I'm I'm not
sure

04:30:39.590 --> 04:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:30:41.710 --> 04:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're asking I'll I'll
 
04:30:43.630 --> 04:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
just say this I I think that a hearing
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
should have two Commissioners because if
 
04:30:48.070 --> 04:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
a decision requires two Commissioners at
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
least one of the people making this
 
04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
decision should have been at the
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
hearing okay well I'm not quite
 
04:30:57.149 --> 04:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
following you okay anyways thank
 
04:30:57.159 --> 04:30:59.189 align:start position:0%
following you okay anyways thank
additional

04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:31:01.630 --> 04:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
legislation now let's hear from the
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate Donald C to get his
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.309 --> 04:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to be
 
04:31:17.950 --> 04:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
brief uh just as I was earlier I'm
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
Donald Cree the consumer Advocate my job
 
04:31:22.510 --> 04:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
is to represent the interests of
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers but right
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to put on my
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
administrative law professor hat I used
 
04:31:31.950 --> 04:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
to teach administrative law before I
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
became consumer Advocate during my long
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
and checkered career for a few years
 
04:31:41.950 --> 04:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
so there are two things that a
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency does whether it's the
 
04:31:46.750 --> 04:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
Federal Communications Commission the
 
04:31:49.149 --> 04:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or
 
04:31:50.590 --> 04:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Public Utilities
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
Commission they make decisions two ways
 
04:31:55.149 --> 04:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
one is through
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
adjudication that applies when there are
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
the rights and privileges a particular
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
singular party at issue or the agency
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
adopts rules and those are decisions
 
04:32:09.309 --> 04:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
that apply across the board to everybody
 
04:32:12.030 --> 04:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't make any sense as a
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
matter of I guess you could say
 
04:32:17.229 --> 04:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
political science uh to constitute
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
something like the Public Utilities
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
Commission and say Well when it
 
04:32:23.790 --> 04:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
adjudicates things it's going to do that
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
as a tribunal of three Commissioners but
 
04:32:28.590 --> 04:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
when it exercises its rulemaking
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
Authority there really isn't a pu
 
04:32:33.149 --> 04:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
anymore there is a chairman of the Pu
 
04:32:36.990 --> 04:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
and all of the authority reposes in the
 
04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
chair of the Pu now the reason that the
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
the chair of the Pu has all of the rule
 
04:32:47.309 --> 04:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
making Authority has already been
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
established when the department of
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
energy was created via the Budget
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
Trailer bill in 2021 inserted into the
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
Budget Trailer bill was an amendment to
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
RSA 363 Section 1 that says and I quote
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
the chair of the commission shall have
 
04:33:07.869 --> 04:33:07.879 align:start position:0%
the powers and duties set forth in RSA
 
04:33:07.879 --> 04:33:09.551 align:start position:0%
the powers and duties set forth in RSA
21

04:33:09.551 --> 04:33:09.561 align:start position:0%
21
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
G9 now I do not think and I was around
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
to watch all of this happen that the
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislature intended when it created the
 
04:33:19.470 --> 04:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy via the Budget
 
04:33:23.551 --> 04:33:23.561 align:start position:0%
Trailer Bill uh four years ago to divest
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
the puc the three commissioners of their
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
rul making Authority and transfer it to
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
the chair of the puc the person who
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
inserted that language in the Budget
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
Trailer bill I think knew exactly what
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
she was doing but I don't think the
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
legislature understood that and so so
 
04:33:44.189 --> 04:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
therefore I think the purpose of this
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
bill that you are now hearing is to fix
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
that and restore it to the full three
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
member pu the authority to promulgate
 
04:33:55.150 --> 04:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
rules it's a little perplexing from my
 
04:33:57.390 --> 04:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
perspective how the clarity of that
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
purpose and the relative ease with which
 
04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
that problem could be solved has somehow
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
gotten all muddled here I mean if it was
 
04:34:08.429 --> 04:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
up to me I would just change the
 
04:34:10.109 --> 04:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
language in RSA
 
04:34:12.590 --> 04:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
3631 to say something something like the
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
chair of the commission shall have the
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
powers and duties set forth in RSA 21 G9
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
except for the power to promulgate rules
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
which shall Repose in the commission
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
meaning the three Commissioners that I
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
think is a pretty straightforward and
 
04:34:30.830 --> 04:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
simple way of getting to achieving the
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill without getting all
 
04:34:36.070 --> 04:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
wound up about uh how many Commissioners
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
you need to hold a hearing or how many
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners you need to make a
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
decision and when you need and when you
 
04:34:45.629 --> 04:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
don't need to uh appoint special
 
04:34:48.029 --> 04:34:48.039 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because uh as you've
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
already established that question is
 
04:34:52.269 --> 04:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
fraught there is already a statute that
 
04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
protects people's right to demand or
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
request a full commissioner all of that
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
so I I I really think this bill could be
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%
drafted in a much more surgical way to
 
04:35:03.990 --> 04:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish what I think it is trying to
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish and I don't think what it is
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish is especially
 
04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
controversial because I think the
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
legislature didn't realize for years ago
 
04:35:14.670 --> 04:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
that it was divesting the full pu of its
 
04:35:17.551 --> 04:35:17.561 align:start position:0%
ruem Authority okay that's probably more
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
than you need to hear from me about that
 
04:35:21.750 --> 04:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
subject so I'll stop talking and then if
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
the chairman wants to have me answer any
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.750 --> 04:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:38.429 --> 04:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
down we could append to the end of that
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
full sentence in on line four the chair
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
of the the commission shall have the
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
powers and duties set forth in RSA 21
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
G9 except for the adoption of commission
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
rules which requires a majority of the
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
commission that would be perfect you did
 
04:35:56.269 --> 04:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of drafting the
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that I would suggest you adopt
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
should I try to get a job at
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
OS I think you should apply for a job at
 
04:36:06.150 --> 04:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
the OCA we need a new staff attorney
 
04:36:09.150 --> 04:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
so okay questions for the consumer
 
04:36:09.160 --> 04:36:12.670 align:start position:0%
so okay questions for the consumer
advocate

04:36:12.670 --> 04:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you I had a
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
question before you went ahead and did
 
04:36:17.230 --> 04:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
that which I think would solve the
 
04:36:19.990 --> 04:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
problem um the question that I had was
 
04:36:22.390 --> 04:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
it it appears that when we do make these
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
references that we often don't follow
 
04:36:26.670 --> 04:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
through to figure out whether it's going
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
to give us what we intend it it sounds
 
04:36:34.349 --> 04:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
like RSA 21 G9 relates in general to the
 
04:36:36.429 --> 04:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
commissioners of the other agencies not
 
04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
to a regulatory body which the Pu is
 
04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
distinct so that's why
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
um that reference then without the
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
exception doesn't give us uh the way the
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
Pu was constituted before this change
 
04:36:52.349 --> 04:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
happened is that a correct
 
04:36:54.429 --> 04:36:54.439 align:start position:0%
interpretation yes you know going back
 
04:36:57.310 --> 04:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
to the warm summer of
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
2021 which was H uh unfolding while the
 
04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic was still somewhat raging I
 
04:37:05.709 --> 04:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
think the idea was that the Pu wanted to
 
04:37:09.230 --> 04:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate the uh office of its executive
 
04:37:11.910 --> 04:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
director and make clear that the chair a
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
person of the Pu is the administrative
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
head of the agency and I think that was
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
probably a reasonable thing to do I'm
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
not sure it's what I would have done but
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
it's not an unreasonable thing to do
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
I'll put it that way so the way to do
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
that apparently was to vest in the chair
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
all of the powers and duties set forth
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
in 21 G9 but one of those powers and
 
04:37:35.629 --> 04:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
duties is Rule making so it's it's not
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
what I would have done it's logical it
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
created this problem which I think the
 
04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
general court itself didn't realize it
 
04:37:43.359 --> 04:37:45.429 align:start position:0%
general court itself didn't realize it
was

04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:51.709 --> 04:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and suggestion
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
04:37:58.029 --> 04:37:58.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity we have one more fol one
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
more person to hear from and that is
 
04:38:02.830 --> 04:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
Alex Sidell from the Public Utilities
 
04:38:06.510 --> 04:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:38:12.830 --> 04:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
04:38:16.269 --> 04:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
so uh the Public Utilities Commission on
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
the pink sheet registered its opposition
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
to this bill and I just wanted to
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
clarify that we are discussing the bills
 
04:38:25.629 --> 04:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
proposed at the present time not
 
04:38:28.590 --> 04:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
involving any amendments and so I'll be
 
04:38:31.990 --> 04:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
keying off of the fiscal note discussion
 
04:38:34.750 --> 04:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
and the language as proposed in the bill
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
and I'll read it because there is the
 
04:38:40.230 --> 04:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
insertion on line three of the word
 
04:38:43.590 --> 04:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh which in part one which is
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
intriguing I it may have something to do
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
with some of the discussions surrounding
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
our investigative authorities but we'll
 
04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
leave that aside but looking at part
 
04:38:57.949 --> 04:38:57.959 align:start position:0%
two the language reads Quorum 363 colon
 
04:39:00.070 --> 04:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
16 a majority of the commission shall
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
constitute a quorum and then their
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
striketh through of this language to
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
issue orders and any hearing may be held
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
or conducted by two Commissioners or by
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
a single commissioner so that's being
 
04:39:14.230 --> 04:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
stricken through in this proposed
 
04:39:17.150 --> 04:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and then the insertion of in
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
this chapter majority quote unquote
 
04:39:21.390 --> 04:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
means at least 2third of the commission
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
regardless of any vacancies so the
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind the fiscal note was
 
04:39:28.709 --> 04:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
that there is a constant flow of
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
hearings work at the commission and
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
there is a constant flow of order
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
issuances happening at the commission so
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
12 months a year 300 65 days of of
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
working days a year it seems like it
 
04:39:49.350 --> 04:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes um constant orders being
 
04:39:53.470 --> 04:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
issued constant acceptances of petitions
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
hearings reviews so the flow of work is
 
04:40:00.270 --> 04:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
constant and having interned at the New
 
04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court it's been 20
 
04:40:04.750 --> 04:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
years amazing to to think about it but
 
04:40:08.708 --> 04:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
that was 20 years ago um the Supreme
 
04:40:08.718 --> 04:40:09.708 align:start position:0%
that was 20 years ago um the Supreme
Court

04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
Court
 
04:40:12.628 --> 04:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
interprets the language of a statute in
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
its totality and all the provisions have
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
to work together and when there's an
 
04:40:19.868 --> 04:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
ambiguity the Supreme Court really digs
 
04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
into the legislative record and looks at
 
04:40:24.030 --> 04:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
what was proposed and why it was
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
proposed and how it was proposed so if
 
04:40:27.670 --> 04:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature is striking through in
 
04:40:30.868 --> 04:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
this proposed Bill two issue orders and
 
04:40:32.670 --> 04:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
any hearing may be held or conducted by
 
04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners or by a single
 
04:40:36.430 --> 04:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
commission or that's an indication to
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court that the legislator
 
04:40:41.590 --> 04:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
means this to have only three Commission
 
04:40:43.470 --> 04:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
hearings no matter what hence the
 
04:40:45.030 --> 04:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
potential of the special
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner so why would the
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners be absent well there's
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
vacancies due to resignation as uh
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner Simpson recently
 
04:40:55.990 --> 04:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
resigned uh there's vacancies uh during
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
the working week due to illness or
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
accident there can also be many
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that the Commissioners
 
04:41:04.470 --> 04:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
discharge outside of the form of the
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
commission itself so they have to go to
 
04:41:10.470 --> 04:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
governor and Council meetings they often
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
appear here at the
 
04:41:15.628 --> 04:41:15.638 align:start position:0%
legislature in one form or another and
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
time flies and sometimes they have to
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
give presentations on the spot and
 
04:41:22.590 --> 04:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
furthermore they interface with their
 
04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues around the country at the
 
04:41:27.750 --> 04:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
national regulatory commissioner
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
Association meetings which are very
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
important and they also have Federal
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
side responsibilities uh we are the
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
junior partner of the dep Department of
 
04:41:37.990 --> 04:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
energy in the field of wholesale
 
04:41:39.750 --> 04:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
regulation as you heard from
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner chado patai
 
04:41:44.910 --> 04:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
and there's also ongoing fora and
 
04:41:48.070 --> 04:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
interactions related to uh National
 
04:41:48.080 --> 04:41:49.390 align:start position:0%
interactions related to uh National
Security

04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
Security
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the field of
 
04:41:51.040 --> 04:41:51.990 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the field of
critical

04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
critical
 
04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh that the Commissioners
 
04:41:55.868 --> 04:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
have to be involved in so their docket
 
04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
is very full
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
they have to have all this done in a
 
04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
given year in a given work week and so
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes you even if you have a full
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
roster of three Commissioners it's tough
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
to rustle up two Commissioners but it
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
can be done but if you must rustle
 
04:42:16.750 --> 04:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
up three Commissioners for everything
 
04:42:19.230 --> 04:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
for every issuance of an order for every
 
04:42:21.910 --> 04:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
hearing it's going to be uh impossible
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
just stop the work of the commission and
 
04:42:25.470 --> 04:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
as far as the single commissioner
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions is concerned I would urge
 
04:42:30.628 --> 04:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
given the safeguards that uh former
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and representative
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
Harrington referred to in
 
04:42:38.070 --> 04:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
3637 that it be retained just in case of
 
04:42:41.550 --> 04:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
emergency in the oil embargo crisis of
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
74 the commission was cranking out
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
emergency orders every day almost to
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
adjust energy rates there were National
 
04:42:52.190 --> 04:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
emergencies in World War I and World War
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
II where the commission was very active
 
04:42:58.350 --> 04:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
so I would just urge caution on the part
 
04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to be very judicious and how
 
04:43:05.708 --> 04:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
they adjust this language in fact not to
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
put this bill forward because it's over
 
04:43:10.350 --> 04:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
Brad language that would really hurt our
 
04:43:10.360 --> 04:43:12.310 align:start position:0%
Brad language that would really hurt our
operations

04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
operations
 
04:43:12.320 --> 04:43:15.190 align:start position:0%
operations
thank

04:43:15.190 --> 04:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:17.708 --> 04:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you now I know you wanted to
 
04:43:20.788 --> 04:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
speak only to the language of the bill
 
04:43:20.798 --> 04:43:22.670 align:start position:0%
speak only to the language of the bill
as

04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:43:25.230 --> 04:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
introduced but I have to ask
 
04:43:29.550 --> 04:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
you if you could interpret the language
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
suggested by the consumer ad
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
line4 we add the phrase except for the
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
adoption of commission rules which
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.628 --> 04:43:49.638 align:start position:0%
commission would you be willing to
 
04:43:51.788 --> 04:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
comment on that or would you prefer
 
04:43:54.670 --> 04:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
to defer a comment until you've had a
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to the Commissioners what
 
04:44:00.070 --> 04:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
would be your your
 
04:44:02.670 --> 04:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
pleasure my initial take on it I would
 
04:44:04.510 --> 04:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
prefer to defer in terms of a formal
 
04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
answer but I would suspect that chairman
 
04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
goldner would respond saying uh I am the
 
04:44:13.590 --> 04:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
administrative head of the agency and
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
this is an administrative task by
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
analogy chairman goldner wears the Hat
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
as the presiding officer and the
 
04:44:24.230 --> 04:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
ultimate capital A administrator of the
 
04:44:27.310 --> 04:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and so he has
 
04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
the capability to do engage in
 
04:44:32.430 --> 04:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
administrative reviews on his own there
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh of course it has to be subject to the
 
04:44:36.590 --> 04:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
review of the full sight of evaluation
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
committee and furthermore the commission
 
04:44:42.510 --> 04:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
rules have to be reviewed not only by
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
Jael car but substantively speaking they
 
04:44:46.708 --> 04:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
are reviewed by the colleagues within
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
the Commission in an informal
 
04:44:50.590 --> 04:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
consultative process so it's an
 
04:44:53.788 --> 04:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
administrative task when the chairman
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
runs the rules hearing it's often as a
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
courtesy because a favorite time to do
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
rule I can say this having about 15
 
04:45:04.270 --> 04:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
years of experience in the Commission in
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the beginning of my tenure um
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
the the the summertime is not a bad time
 
04:45:14.350 --> 04:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
to have rules put forward for adoption
 
04:45:16.628 --> 04:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
because uh there's a little bit of a
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
slackening in the work schedule and for
 
04:45:22.070 --> 04:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
instance chairman goldner can run a
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
rules hearing when say one of the other
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is traveling abroad to
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
visit his family or uh driving on a
 
04:45:31.628 --> 04:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
family vacation for a couple weeks it's
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's an amenity it's an administrative
 
04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
amenity and I I don't personally see any
 
04:45:39.868 --> 04:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
harm from that but I think uh perhaps
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
chairman goldner could give a formal
 
04:45:43.070 --> 04:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
response as well to the committee if
 
04:45:44.910 --> 04:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
you're interested on
 
04:45:47.470 --> 04:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
that yes if you would ask for that we'd
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yes sir further
 
04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee has one
 
04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:45:58.470 --> 04:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
being with us again so my question um in
 
04:46:01.590 --> 04:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony you mentioned that having
 
04:46:03.390 --> 04:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners available all the
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
time is not really workable but I don't
 
04:46:07.868 --> 04:46:07.878 align:start position:0%
think that there's anything here that
 
04:46:09.590 --> 04:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
suggests that all three need to be
 
04:46:12.110 --> 04:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
present for things to for work to be
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
happening as was explained by the
 
04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate it it appears that
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicative decisions and rules um
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
being decided upon um that's what the
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
bill is related to is those those two um
 
04:46:30.510 --> 04:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
aspects of commission business and so my
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
question is in the 15 years that you've
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
been involved how often has one
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner um decided on the rules by
 
04:46:40.480 --> 04:46:41.350 align:start position:0%
commissioner um decided on the rules by
themselves

04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
is that something that's only recent or
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh has it was it always that way is it
 
04:46:49.590 --> 04:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
is it unusual to have one commissioner
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
decide on the rules well
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
respectfully I think there's been a
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of backpedaling during the
 
04:46:58.750 --> 04:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
course of the hearing regarding the
 
04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
scope of the words presented here
 
04:47:02.910 --> 04:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
because when you actually read the words
 
04:47:05.470 --> 04:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
and you interpret them legally they say
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
that any order or any hearing must be
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
held by three Commissioners because of
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
the issuance of the strike through in
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
part two of this bill this is the bill
 
04:47:15.750 --> 04:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
so leaving that
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
aside I would say
 
04:47:24.430 --> 04:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
that whatever happened in 21 was done by
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature for good and valid
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
reasons but the structure of the bill as
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's presented here would result in the
 
04:47:35.070 --> 04:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
inability of the commission to ever
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
issue an order or have any hearing
 
04:47:39.270 --> 04:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
unless there were three Commissioners on
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
the roster whether through the
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
introduction of a special commissioner
 
04:47:46.750 --> 04:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
or through the uh appointment of a full
 
04:47:48.270 --> 04:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
roster of three Commissioners because of
 
04:47:49.548 --> 04:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
the strike through the striketh through
 
04:47:51.868 --> 04:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
is a very important deal and I'm very
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
rarely so blunt about things but I have
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
clear representative Harrington yeah
 
04:48:03.868 --> 04:48:03.878 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm I'm a little confused
 
04:48:06.390 --> 04:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
now because you keep referring to saying
 
04:48:08.230 --> 04:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
that it would require three
 
04:48:10.948 --> 04:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to do anything but what
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this to say is that a
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
majority of the commissions shall
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
constitute a quorum and this chapter
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
majority leads at least 2third of the
 
04:48:20.910 --> 04:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
commission regardless of any vacancies
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
so they would would require two why do
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
you keep saying three I'm a little
 
04:48:27.990 --> 04:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
confused well because the legislature if
 
04:48:30.548 --> 04:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
this enactment were to be passed would
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
be accepting the striketh through of the
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
language that refers to to issue orders
 
04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
and any hearing may be held or conducted
 
04:48:40.910 --> 04:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
by two Commissioners so if you're
 
04:48:42.628 --> 04:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
removing that Authority as part of this
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
language in the context of saying that a
 
04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
majority Quorum is at least 2third of
 
04:48:50.190 --> 04:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
the commission the Supreme Court would
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
interpret that to mean that
 
04:48:54.910 --> 04:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
aha you number one the legislature has
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
taken away your capability to have any
 
04:48:58.390 --> 04:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
hearing or order issue with two
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and so ver therefore the
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
only logical explanation is that a
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
quorum is a quorum of three
 
04:49:06.110 --> 04:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners with two Commissioners in
 
04:49:06.120 --> 04:49:07.390 align:start position:0%
Commissioners with two Commissioners in
agreement

04:49:07.390 --> 04:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:49:09.390 --> 04:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
or okay a
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
followup yes so I get this clear then if
 
04:49:14.070 --> 04:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
if we would to write it
 
04:49:16.750 --> 04:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
as the majority of the commission shall
 
04:49:20.270 --> 04:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
constitute a quorum to issue orders and
 
04:49:22.310 --> 04:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
any hearing may be held or conducted by
 
04:49:25.470 --> 04:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners period get rid of or
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
by a single
 
04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner that would then get clear
 
04:49:30.510 --> 04:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
then that two Commissioners could issue
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
an order and two Commissioners could
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:49:36.150 --> 04:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
hearing if we get rid of that word or by
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
a single commissioner and left the other
 
04:49:37.680 --> 04:49:38.910 align:start position:0%
a single commissioner and left the other
words

04:49:38.910 --> 04:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
words
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
in so are you proposing to uh move away
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
from I I think you had earlier in the
 
04:49:47.708 --> 04:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
hearing Mr representative been
 
04:49:50.110 --> 04:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
supporting the idea of having a single
 
04:49:52.510 --> 04:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner available if there is no
 
04:49:54.788 --> 04:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
objection under
 
04:49:57.390 --> 04:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
36317 what I'm trying to do is is just
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
get this the meaning of this straight
 
04:50:00.910 --> 04:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
because you seem to be interpreting as
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
written saying that if you review this
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
as a whole and you're the lawyer I'm not
 
04:50:07.628 --> 04:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to think assume you know
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
more about this than I do that it could
 
04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
be interpreted to say that as this uh
 
04:50:15.150 --> 04:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
bill is proposed it would require three
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and what I'm saying is if
 
04:50:21.548 --> 04:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
we got rid of if we left it in and just
 
04:50:23.310 --> 04:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
got rid of the statement or by a single
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner would you then agree that a
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners could have a hearing
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
and could issue an order I'd have to see
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
the final language on that but that's a
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
definite improvement from completely
 
04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
striking through the authority of the
 
04:50:38.510 --> 04:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
commission to have a hearing with two
 
04:50:43.150 --> 04:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.160 --> 04:50:46.150 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.708 --> 04:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee sorry I
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
do have one more question and that is
 
04:50:56.150 --> 04:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
since what we've heard here is that the
 
04:50:59.390 --> 04:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
I believe the intent of the bill is
 
04:51:05.070 --> 04:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
to affect having a quorum available for
 
04:51:07.788 --> 04:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
adjudicative decision- making and Ru
 
04:51:11.310 --> 04:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
making so that is not explicitly called
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
out in this language and I think that
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
may be where the lack of
 
04:51:17.948 --> 04:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
clarity seems to give rise to your
 
04:51:19.628 --> 04:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
concerns that if it's written this way
 
04:51:21.190 --> 04:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
then other things that the commission is
 
04:51:23.788 --> 04:51:23.798 align:start position:0%
attempting to do might be also held to
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
that standard but I think the intent of
 
04:51:29.548 --> 04:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
the language and the intent um of the
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor was to get at the fact
 
04:51:34.150 --> 04:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
that the decision- making and the rule
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
making coming out of the commission
 
04:51:38.510 --> 04:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
should be conducted by a quorum of the
 
04:51:41.708 --> 04:51:41.718 align:start position:0%
commission rather than by you know less
 
04:51:43.868 --> 04:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
less than a
 
04:51:47.110 --> 04:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
quorum so I wonder if the language meets
 
04:51:52.110 --> 04:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
that as is uh as is unfortunately not uh
 
04:51:54.270 --> 04:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
there are discussions about adjustments
 
04:51:56.350 --> 04:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
but you know I would want uh the
 
04:51:58.030 --> 04:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
commission to have the chance to respond
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
to those but it it it's statutory
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
construction is is kind of at the heart
 
04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
of the matter and I've I've studied
 
04:52:09.070 --> 04:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
administrative law at length as well and
 
04:52:12.030 --> 04:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
when there's a statutory amb uity it
 
04:52:14.670 --> 04:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
they default to the legislative intent
 
04:52:16.230 --> 04:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you can get all the way to
 
04:52:17.948 --> 04:52:17.958 align:start position:0%
the Finish Line with legislative intent
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
but when in doubt they'll say well the
 
04:52:21.830 --> 04:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislature took a big red pencil and
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
did not want the commission and
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
adjudicative actions mean our orders are
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
hearings that's the meat and potatoes of
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
what we do so that's a lot of what we do
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
and so it's understood that there ought
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
to be and our tradition has been that we
 
04:52:36.510 --> 04:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
always have two Commissioners present
 
04:52:38.708 --> 04:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
for these adjudicative proceedings one
 
04:52:43.230 --> 04:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
way or the other and so uh it's
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that the Supreme
 
04:52:48.910 --> 04:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
Court can be ruthless in its uh
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
application of the literal words of the
 
04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
statute that's what I would caution
 
04:52:58.750 --> 04:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
against follow up um
 
04:53:01.590 --> 04:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
so it when I my first question to you
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
was about whether or not there had ever
 
04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
been one individual commissioner
 
04:53:10.750 --> 04:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for rulle making do they is
 
04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
that how it's been done traditionally I
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
don't think I ever really got an answer
 
04:53:15.788 --> 04:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:53:19.990 --> 04:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
um is it common place or is it unusual
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
well I from what we heard today there
 
04:53:25.230 --> 04:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
was a change in 21 where the chairman
 
04:53:26.910 --> 04:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
could preside or the chair woman could
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
preside so in in the past it was it in
 
04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
the past it was done by a quorum of the
 
04:53:35.788 --> 04:53:35.798 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in the sense of there were
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
two or three Commissioners on the bench
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
ruling on these adoptions so that's how
 
04:53:44.910 --> 04:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
it was before 2021 yeah and I think
 
04:53:46.230 --> 04:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to clarify here
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
is that I don't think anybody realize we
 
04:53:53.390 --> 04:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
changed it when that when the doe was
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:01.350 --> 04:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
you for being here to testify and with
 
04:54:07.948 --> 04:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to close than the public
 
04:54:12.190 --> 04:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 16 9
 
04:54:14.830 --> 04:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
FN we'll be starting an executive
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
session in a few minutes but before we
 
04:54:19.948 --> 04:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
do that I want to ask representative PL
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
to read some results from blue sheets
 
04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
and before I ask him to do that I'm
 
04:54:30.548 --> 04:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:35.910 --> 04:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
from the online remote
 
04:54:38.750 --> 04:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
testimony portal that we have on the
 
04:54:41.230 --> 04:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
House website
 
04:54:41.240 --> 04:54:42.868 align:start position:0%
House website
so

04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
for House Bill
 
04:54:48.990 --> 04:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
166 there were four people in support
 
04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
and one person opposed the
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill for House Bill 306 there were 111
 
04:55:00.190 --> 04:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
supporting and five
 
04:55:04.750 --> 04:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:07.708 --> 04:55:07.718 align:start position:0%

opposing and for house Bill 526 there
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
were 24 supposing uh supporting and
 
04:55:15.120 --> 04:55:16.590 align:start position:0%
were 24 supposing uh supporting and
seven

106 um discussion representative Vice
 
05:03:30.350 --> 05:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas thank you Mr chair uh we
 
05:03:33.470 --> 05:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of U testimony back and
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
forth u a lot of good testimony
 
05:03:38.190 --> 05:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
indicating that you know weather is
 
05:03:41.708 --> 05:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
changing we have a ups and downs but one
 
05:03:43.470 --> 05:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that struck me the most
 
05:03:46.510 --> 05:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
and that concerned me the most was that
 
05:03:50.350 --> 05:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh there were predictions uh being put
 
05:03:53.590 --> 05:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
forth as the basis for this bill and I'm
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
not quite sure that um it would be uh
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
prudent to um hold the commission based
 
05:04:03.548 --> 05:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
on predictions especially since uh there
 
05:04:06.030 --> 05:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
were a lot of pros and cons uh given
 
05:04:09.030 --> 05:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
forth during the testimony as to actual
 
05:04:12.030 --> 05:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
causes or what effects studies would
 
05:04:15.070 --> 05:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
even have and one of the and one of the
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
things that were was mentioned was um
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
damages uh could they be attributed to
 
05:04:23.350 --> 05:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
things done within the state would they
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
come over come in from overstate could
 
05:04:28.830 --> 05:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
there be serious liabilities and uh you
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
know lawsuits presented if if uh if uh
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
companies complain that uh it wasn't
 
05:04:37.390 --> 05:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
them but it was someone from Vermont
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
that uh that that did the duty the duty
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
deed so uh based on those things there I
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
think uh for lack of any hardcore um
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
absolutes it's it's in the best interest
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
to just itail this
 
05:04:54.910 --> 05:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
bill further discussion representative
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um I I
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that constant Road
 
05:05:04.990 --> 05:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
wash outs due to flooding um coastal
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
flooding impact to tourists with regard
 
05:05:12.628 --> 05:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
to Winter Sports specifically skiing and
 
05:05:15.788 --> 05:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
enjoying our lakes and the
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh proliferation of cyanobacteria in our
 
05:05:22.030 --> 05:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
Lakes because of warm water is are are
 
05:05:24.390 --> 05:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
those are not predictions those are um
 
05:05:27.230 --> 05:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
actual impacts that we are seeing in our
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
state as a
 
05:05:31.628 --> 05:05:31.638 align:start position:0%
result of of climate change and I think
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
that this uh commission is long time
 
05:05:37.390 --> 05:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
overdue we're we're far behind all of
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
the other states in New England and and
 
05:05:41.868 --> 05:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
if we don't get IR act together our
 
05:05:43.750 --> 05:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
economy is going to suffer as a result
 
05:05:43.760 --> 05:05:44.868 align:start position:0%
economy is going to suffer as a result
of

05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:05:47.708 --> 05:05:47.718 align:start position:0%
it additional
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
um I just think it's uh it's a shame
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
that a serious issue has become a
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
political circus yet again and uh
 
05:06:06.030 --> 05:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
because I I know it's ironic that if I
 
05:06:07.628 --> 05:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
approached every single person on this
 
05:06:08.910 --> 05:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee individually and I said
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's a longterm term intractable
 
05:06:12.430 --> 05:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
problem that needs a whole of government
 
05:06:14.830 --> 05:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
approach and we need to wrap our our
 
05:06:16.548 --> 05:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
hands our heads around it and get our
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
hands on it so we can take care of it to
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
take care of our constituents every
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
single person on this committee would be
 
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
in favor of doing so but for some reason
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the climate it
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
becomes a toxic environment and we can't
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
drop the partisan baggage that has
 
05:06:34.830 --> 05:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
plagued us for decades now around this
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
issue I I I say for some reason I know
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
the reason uh and it was mentioned by
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
somebody who was testifying at our
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Monday the young woman
 
05:06:44.030 --> 05:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
from Bowden College when she talked
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
about the fossil fuel industry and their
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
propaganda campaign that's gone on for
 
05:06:51.150 --> 05:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
decades uh to misinform and and divert
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
the public from understanding the the
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
causes of this issue and I know that the
 
05:06:58.510 --> 05:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
people on this committee understand that
 
05:07:00.548 --> 05:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
issue and and recognize it because no
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
nobody here is is is that misinformed
 
05:07:05.230 --> 05:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
and the fact the fact of the matter is
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
we have part bipartisan bills in front
 
05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
of us this session that mentioned
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
climate CL change and uh so that we know
 
05:07:14.430 --> 05:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
that it's an issue that Republicans and
 
05:07:16.750 --> 05:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
Democrats alike are aware of the problem
 
05:07:18.628 --> 05:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
is that they they come at the problem
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
from from you know a little property tax
 
05:07:22.628 --> 05:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
abatement over here a little Federal
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
grant money over there this requires a
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh to use a term of art that was favored
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
by our former colleague The Honorable
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
Becca McWilliams she she called it a
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
bucket this is an issue that needs its
 
05:07:36.788 --> 05:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
own bucket and that's what this bill is
 
05:07:39.510 --> 05:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
intended to do it creates a commission
 
05:07:41.948 --> 05:07:41.958 align:start position:0%
where we can hear experts uh to try to
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
determine in a fiscally responsible
 
05:07:45.788 --> 05:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
manner what are the financial damages
 
05:07:47.830 --> 05:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
that we are looking at in the next few
 
05:07:49.708 --> 05:07:49.718 align:start position:0%
years in our state in order to protect
 
05:07:52.030 --> 05:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
our constituents and our communities
 
05:07:54.110 --> 05:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
from the damages that we know are coming
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
and the preponderance of scientific
 
05:07:58.590 --> 05:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
evidence has left us no doubt that that
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
is something that we will be facing and
 
05:08:03.670 --> 05:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
to to to question that is just to it's
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
it's worse than will for ignorance it's
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's negligence and it's
 
05:08:09.948 --> 05:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
dereliction of our duty this Commission
 
05:08:12.590 --> 05:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
is basically taking a walk to the top of
 
05:08:14.670 --> 05:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
the hill to see if the Indians are
 
05:08:17.948 --> 05:08:17.958 align:start position:0%
coming and as far as I know in the
 
05:08:19.788 --> 05:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
movies that I'm aware of people don't
 
05:08:21.190 --> 05:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
say we're not going to walk to the top
 
05:08:22.470 --> 05:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
of hill because we don't care if the
 
05:08:24.628 --> 05:08:24.638 align:start position:0%
Indians are coming we do
 
05:08:27.150 --> 05:08:27.160 align:start position:0%
care and so that's not what I signed up
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
for I signed up to take care of my
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
constituents to try to make this state a
 
05:08:33.510 --> 05:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
better place for our children so I'll
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
leave it at that Vice chair Thomas thank
 
05:08:40.350 --> 05:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I can app appreciate the
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
memb opposing point of belief I take
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
some umbrage as to the inference that uh
 
05:08:51.110 --> 05:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
an opposite point of view has no merit
 
05:08:53.788 --> 05:08:53.798 align:start position:0%
we heard uh testimony from Two
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
wellestablished and credible testifiers
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
that presented an opposite point of view
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
and because of that um despite our
 
05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
differences of where we think things are
 
05:09:07.510 --> 05:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
coming from respectfully thinking
 
05:09:09.788 --> 05:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
there's enough uncertainty to not
 
05:09:13.948 --> 05:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
subject the state to um unknown costs
 
05:09:15.910 --> 05:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
when we don't know where those costs are
 
05:09:18.190 --> 05:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
actually coming from or who's causing
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
them or what would be causing them and
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
also subjecting the potential of
 
05:09:25.830 --> 05:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
liabilities in the state when we cannot
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
figure out if there were any such
 
05:09:30.670 --> 05:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
damages where did they come from from
 
05:09:32.548 --> 05:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
other states or other countries and who
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
would we blame them and if we try to
 
05:09:38.430 --> 05:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
assess uh blame to one company how would
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
they prove or how would they wouldn't
 
05:09:41.548 --> 05:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
prove that it didn't come from outside
 
05:09:43.708 --> 05:09:43.718 align:start position:0%
the area leads to a whole bunch of
 
05:09:46.788 --> 05:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
potential litigations so that's what we
 
05:09:49.948 --> 05:09:49.958 align:start position:0%
believe and I think both points of view
 
05:09:53.548 --> 05:09:53.558 align:start position:0%
have their their uh corners of um of of
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
support and I think the overall result
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
is just the overall uncertainty of just
 
05:10:01.470 --> 05:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
what's happening here so respectfully um
 
05:10:04.150 --> 05:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh we we need to be cautious in uh
 
05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward that's why we should it
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
it this
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill repres representative Corman has a
 
05:10:14.150 --> 05:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
point to make thank you actually I have
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
several so yeah I I I'm amazed here it
 
05:10:20.110 --> 05:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
is it's 2025 and we're still debating
 
05:10:22.470 --> 05:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
about climate change and some of the
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
things that we heard last week climate
 
05:10:27.548 --> 05:10:27.558 align:start position:0%
change isn't real or if it's happening
 
05:10:29.548 --> 05:10:29.558 align:start position:0%
human activity has nothing to do with it
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
or if humans are putting carbon into the
 
05:10:32.708 --> 05:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that's not what's causing
 
05:10:34.750 --> 05:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
temperatures to rise or if temperatures
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
are rising that's not what's causing
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events or in fact
 
05:10:39.948 --> 05:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
there's no increase in EXT weather
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
events um I would just ask you know why
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't you guys like pick one and stick
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
with it
 
05:10:49.270 --> 05:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we we heard earlier today
 
05:10:53.708 --> 05:10:53.718 align:start position:0%
when you fail to plan you're planning to
 
05:10:56.910 --> 05:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
fail and what this commission is trying
 
05:10:59.310 --> 05:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
to do is plan for the effects of climate
 
05:11:02.110 --> 05:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
change we are seeing it all around us I
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
actually uh was in touch with Jessica um
 
05:11:09.788 --> 05:11:09.798 align:start position:0%
uh I forgot her last name here Jessica
 
05:11:11.910 --> 05:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
from uh ski New Hampshire and she gave
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
me all sorts of information about how
 
05:11:16.510 --> 05:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's affecting the ski industry what
 
05:11:17.948 --> 05:11:17.958 align:start position:0%
they're finding and it's not just a
 
05:11:21.070 --> 05:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
matter of uh fewer days it's a matter of
 
05:11:22.788 --> 05:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's hard for them to even do snow
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
making because of droughts and because
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
of uh temperatures that don't promote
 
05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
snow making so you know we're hearing it
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the recreational industry one other
 
05:11:35.708 --> 05:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to make is um there there
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
was some some discussion about uh
 
05:11:42.590 --> 05:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
the extreme weather events that have
 
05:11:45.670 --> 05:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
happened how many were caused by climate
 
05:11:49.270 --> 05:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
change and you can't draw a direct line
 
05:11:52.590 --> 05:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
between an extreme weather event and a
 
05:11:54.548 --> 05:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
particular facet of climate change
 
05:11:58.230 --> 05:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
climate change creates conditions that
 
05:12:01.150 --> 05:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
promote extreme weather events you can't
 
05:12:02.548 --> 05:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
ask this question any more than you
 
05:12:04.030 --> 05:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
could say to somebody who smokes
 
05:12:06.750 --> 05:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and has lung cancer which
 
05:12:09.310 --> 05:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
cigarette gave you the lung cancer it
 
05:12:11.230 --> 05:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't work that way it's that it's
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
promoting this possibility it makes it
 
05:12:15.750 --> 05:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
more likely that you have extreme
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
weather events it's not like this
 
05:12:20.110 --> 05:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
weather event was caused by this aspect
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
of climate so you know I just feel like
 
05:12:24.470 --> 05:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
we need to be understanding of climate
 
05:12:26.990 --> 05:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
change and believe that it's happening
 
05:12:29.548 --> 05:12:29.558 align:start position:0%
regardless of the cause it's happening
 
05:12:32.230 --> 05:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
and we need to be able to adapt to it
 
05:12:34.030 --> 05:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what this commission would be
 
05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
05:12:38.788 --> 05:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
do representative Summers thank you Mr
 
05:12:38.798 --> 05:12:39.868 align:start position:0%
do representative Summers thank you Mr
chairman

05:12:39.868 --> 05:12:39.878 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:12:42.788 --> 05:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
um so I look at this as a and and
 
05:12:45.030 --> 05:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
forgive me for saying so but a
 
05:12:46.990 --> 05:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
difference of being in science
 
05:12:49.548 --> 05:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
technology energy and being that uh I I
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
see a difference between science and
 
05:12:53.910 --> 05:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
religion and where I look at the science
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
I think of the different main difference
 
05:12:57.070 --> 05:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
I view is the scientific method and
 
05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the scientific method granted
 
05:13:01.510 --> 05:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
after test hypothesis which we all would
 
05:13:04.510 --> 05:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
do next would be draw conclusions of
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
what actually happened so we look at the
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
case in point look at the scientific
 
05:13:12.510 --> 05:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
fact of the last ice age some folks
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
would say that right now we're at the um
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
according to written um L literature
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
that we're coming near the end of a the
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
last ice age some would say the last ice
 
05:13:27.628 --> 05:13:27.638 align:start position:0%
age was caused by The Irregular oval of
 
05:13:29.590 --> 05:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
the earth that's going around the Sun
 
05:13:31.990 --> 05:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
and also there's a wobble of the axis of
 
05:13:33.470 --> 05:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
the earth now I'm not saying this is
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
causing the the climate change rapid
 
05:13:39.350 --> 05:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
temperature rate at this moment but what
 
05:13:41.470 --> 05:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is to draw conclusions to be
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
able to end the scientific fact it's
 
05:13:46.990 --> 05:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
it's to a point of where it's not
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
where're we're looking to impose damages
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
on something that is not proven
 
05:13:54.470 --> 05:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
scientific fact it is
 
05:13:57.190 --> 05:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
scientific not only maybe hypothesis
 
05:13:59.150 --> 05:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
maybe Beyond hypothesis to drawing
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
conclusions but it's not fact at this
 
05:14:04.590 --> 05:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
time as of scientific law thank
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr
 
05:14:13.390 --> 05:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
chair I've seen the
 
05:14:15.708 --> 05:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
expression I don't know what the future
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
holds but I know who holds the
 
05:14:22.390 --> 05:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
future and I see a lot of assertions or
 
05:14:24.948 --> 05:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot of assertions that you
 
05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
can't prove it's happening therefore it
 
05:14:31.270 --> 05:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
isn't the future you know since I don't
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
think anybody's in this room and nobody
 
05:14:36.628 --> 05:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
testify today who knows the
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
future and what we do as humans is we
 
05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
take a look at things that have happened
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
we develop models and project into the
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
future and using that information and as
 
05:14:55.230 --> 05:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
time passes if things start to happen
 
05:14:58.590 --> 05:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
that conform to those models you have a
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
chance or good probability that your
 
05:15:04.470 --> 05:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
models are accurate and with a large
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
preponderance of scientists who are
 
05:15:09.070 --> 05:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
saying that there should be concern
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
then maybe instead of saying well you
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
can't prove it therefore we should
 
05:15:18.990 --> 05:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
reject it and we won't do anything
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel like The Prudent thing to
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
do I think insurance companies are
 
05:15:26.910 --> 05:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
probably leaders and doing probability
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
and putting dollar figures on it and
 
05:15:31.750 --> 05:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
analyzing risk and that's what we're
 
05:15:34.110 --> 05:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
talking about is taking a look at
 
05:15:36.190 --> 05:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
analyzing risk of certain things
 
05:15:38.470 --> 05:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
happening based upon other things that
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
have happened
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
and help people prepare for those
 
05:15:45.628 --> 05:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
possible outcomes thank you for your
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
time additional comment representative
 
05:15:51.868 --> 05:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman um I want to
 
05:15:55.830 --> 05:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
bring it back to I to the people I
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
represent basically um when you drive
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
into my town there are signs from the
 
05:16:03.750 --> 05:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
south and signs from the East that say
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to Hollis a farming
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
Community um I have very good
 
05:16:10.110 --> 05:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
relationships with the farmers in my
 
05:16:13.390 --> 05:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
town there are many farmers in my town
 
05:16:14.910 --> 05:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh and they've been long established we
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
have a family in town at Brookdale Fruit
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
Farm who are on their eighth generation
 
05:16:19.680 --> 05:16:20.628 align:start position:0%
Farm who are on their eighth generation
in

05:16:20.628 --> 05:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
Hollis um and I've talked to these folks
 
05:16:25.270 --> 05:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
about the changes that they've been
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
seeing in their how they've had to
 
05:16:29.628 --> 05:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
modify their farming practices there
 
05:16:32.948 --> 05:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
isn't any question among these long
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
standing New Hampshire residents that
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
climate change is happening and it is
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
affecting their businesses is the crop
 
05:16:44.190 --> 05:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
losses that we had last year um required
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
Federal funding and so maybe we didn't
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
feel the hit of that as significantly as
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
we might have if there wasn't Federal
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
funding um dedicated to the awareness
 
05:16:58.430 --> 05:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
that communities are continuing to
 
05:17:01.590 --> 05:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
suffer economic damage as a result of
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
warming temperatures
 
05:17:07.948 --> 05:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
affecting um everything from uh the
 
05:17:09.868 --> 05:17:09.878 align:start position:0%
growing season
 
05:17:12.670 --> 05:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
to uh you know I mean no one really
 
05:17:14.430 --> 05:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
cares if you tap the maples at a
 
05:17:16.030 --> 05:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
different time of year as long as you
 
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
can still get the maple syrup but there
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
are many many changes that are happening
 
05:17:24.110 --> 05:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um earlier
 
05:17:27.310 --> 05:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
today in testimony uh it was mentioned
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
that UNH is doing a significant amount
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
of work around what the changes are in
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we've had testimony in
 
05:17:37.470 --> 05:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the past on this very
 
05:17:41.788 --> 05:17:41.798 align:start position:0%
topic we can can choose to ignore it and
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
say not something we have to worry about
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
but we I think the facts are on our side
 
05:17:50.910 --> 05:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
I actually used chat GPT to ask some
 
05:17:53.110 --> 05:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
objective questions after our hearings
 
05:17:56.270 --> 05:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
last week about fossil fuel consumption
 
05:17:57.868 --> 05:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
about climate
 
05:18:01.270 --> 05:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
damage and the various categories that
 
05:18:03.590 --> 05:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
those damages fall into in terms of
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
economics and to kind of reiterate
 
05:18:09.470 --> 05:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
represent this the prime sponsor um
 
05:18:12.310 --> 05:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan's point it it
 
05:18:14.548 --> 05:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
borders on negligence if we're not
 
05:18:17.430 --> 05:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
looking at this and I I you know I'm I'm
 
05:18:21.390 --> 05:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
actually pretty um measured in the
 
05:18:23.788 --> 05:18:23.798 align:start position:0%
language that I use in this committee
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
but for us to say over and over that
 
05:18:28.990 --> 05:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
there isn't even any benefit in US
 
05:18:31.510 --> 05:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
looking into it so that we can figure
 
05:18:34.150 --> 05:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
out what threats there are to our
 
05:18:36.270 --> 05:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
economy and to the businesses in this
 
05:18:39.190 --> 05:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
state like the farmers in my community
 
05:18:42.030 --> 05:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
um and also to look at if there are any
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
potential ways to recover monies that
 
05:18:46.830 --> 05:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
the state will suffer as a result of
 
05:18:49.788 --> 05:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
these changes I mean who else's job is
 
05:18:53.788 --> 05:18:53.798 align:start position:0%
it so that's where I stand on the bill
 
05:18:56.708 --> 05:18:56.718 align:start position:0%
it's if not us who you know we're we're
 
05:18:58.830 --> 05:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
the people who are responsible for
 
05:19:00.350 --> 05:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
getting that information and figuring
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
out if there is any action that should
 
05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
be taken on behalf of the folks who were
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
losing money because of the warming
 
05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:13.360 --> 05:19:15.548 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:19:15.548 --> 05:19:15.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.270 --> 05:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
chairman I do not
 
05:19:26.430 --> 05:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
purport to
 
05:19:26.440 --> 05:19:28.670 align:start position:0%
purport to
be

05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:19:28.680 --> 05:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
be
smarter

05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
smarter
 
05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
than all of
 
05:19:32.680 --> 05:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
than all of
the

05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:19:34.320 --> 05:19:36.390 align:start position:0%
the
collective

05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
collective
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
of all the scientists in the National
 
05:19:46.150 --> 05:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
Academy of
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
Union the American Association for the
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
advancement of
 
05:19:59.548 --> 05:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
science but I have
 
05:20:03.070 --> 05:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
read the statements of each of those
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
organizations which of course are
 
05:20:11.548 --> 05:20:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:14.548 --> 05:20:14.558 align:start position:0%
and all of those organizations and
 
05:20:17.948 --> 05:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
therefore all of the thousands of
 
05:20:21.150 --> 05:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
scientists that they
 
05:20:25.788 --> 05:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
represent have stated unequivocally that
 
05:20:29.548 --> 05:20:29.558 align:start position:0%
climate change is real and human
 
05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
activities are causing it at a very high
 
05:20:33.958 --> 05:20:36.750 align:start position:0%
activities are causing it at a very high
confidence

05:20:36.750 --> 05:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
level when I introduced my myself to
 
05:20:42.510 --> 05:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
this committee um last week two weeks
 
05:20:46.150 --> 05:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
ago you know I stated that one of the
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
positions I had in my past was working
 
05:20:50.350 --> 05:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
for a non National nonprofit
 
05:20:51.868 --> 05:20:51.878 align:start position:0%
organization called the union of
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
concerned scientists and I was the
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
Northeast climate policy
 
05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator for three plus years and in
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
that role was involved in publicizing a
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
study it was actually a sort of a meta
 
05:21:08.040 --> 05:21:09.510 align:start position:0%
study it was actually a sort of a meta
study

05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:21:13.350 --> 05:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
of large number of of different studies
 
05:21:19.948 --> 05:21:19.958 align:start position:0%
into one synthesis report called the
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
Northeast climate impacts assessment
 
05:21:26.948 --> 05:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
published in 2007 so almost 20 years ago
 
05:21:30.310 --> 05:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the projected impacts of climate
 
05:21:34.830 --> 05:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
change on the north east and we even did
 
05:21:37.628 --> 05:21:37.638 align:start position:0%
individual reports on each individual
 
05:21:40.510 --> 05:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
state describing the projected impacts
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
of climate
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
change almost 20 years ago and they and
 
05:21:49.470 --> 05:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
those reports discussed things like
 
05:21:51.150 --> 05:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
impacts on
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
Fisheries from warming Coastal Waters
 
05:21:58.590 --> 05:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
impacts on the ski and tourism more
 
05:22:00.868 --> 05:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
broadly the tourism industry you know
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling is a huge tourism business
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
05:22:08.830 --> 05:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um impacts on agriculture imps
 
05:22:08.840 --> 05:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um impacts on agriculture imps
on

05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
forestry and all of those impacts are
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
being felt today I don't think anybody
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
can honestly say that the increasingly
 
05:22:25.670 --> 05:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
erratic weather and warming temperatures
 
05:22:28.750 --> 05:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
that we' see are not
 
05:22:32.910 --> 05:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
affecting the uh economics of this state
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
the businesses of this state and the
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
residents of this state um the ice in
 
05:22:42.628 --> 05:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:45.548 --> 05:22:45.558 align:start position:0%
shrinking uh and
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
so this bill is not is a bill that
 
05:22:55.070 --> 05:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
would put this state on a path
 
05:22:55.080 --> 05:22:56.628 align:start position:0%
would put this state on a path
to

05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
document those
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
impacts put a price tag on those impacts
 
05:23:05.150 --> 05:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
and position New
 
05:23:05.160 --> 05:23:07.110 align:start position:0%
and position New
Hampshire

05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
to PO eventually seek to recover some of
 
05:23:10.798 --> 05:23:12.708 align:start position:0%
to PO eventually seek to recover some of
those

05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
costs not from other residents of New
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but from the global fossil
 
05:23:19.280 --> 05:23:20.590 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but from the global fossil
fuel

05:23:20.590 --> 05:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
fuel
 
05:23:23.788 --> 05:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
industry that has engaged as we heard
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and as we've all
 
05:23:29.230 --> 05:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
seen documented uh you know conducted a
 
05:23:31.948 --> 05:23:31.958 align:start position:0%
40-year plus campaign of
 
05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
disinformation that fossil fuels you
 
05:23:38.430 --> 05:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
know were not any cause of climate
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
climate change there's a very strong
 
05:23:41.520 --> 05:23:43.910 align:start position:0%
climate change there's a very strong
parallel

05:23:43.910 --> 05:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
parallel
 
05:23:47.470 --> 05:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
to the tobacco settlement to the damages
 
05:23:47.480 --> 05:23:48.910 align:start position:0%
to the tobacco settlement to the damages
caused

05:23:48.910 --> 05:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
caused
 
05:23:53.470 --> 05:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
by smoking and the eventual multi-state
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that resulted in a multi-million
 
05:23:59.470 --> 05:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
dollar settlement with the tobacco
 
05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
industry which New Hampshire partook in
 
05:24:05.310 --> 05:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire received benefits from
 
05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
so this bill is about as representative
 
05:24:12.670 --> 05:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
McGee said positioning New Hampshire to
 
05:24:12.680 --> 05:24:15.430 align:start position:0%
McGee said positioning New Hampshire to
be

05:24:15.430 --> 05:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
prepared to protect its citizens from
 
05:24:24.230 --> 05:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:27.190 --> 05:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
happening thank you representative I
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
think uh we've all had a chance to State
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
our positions
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to close this uh
 
05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
hearing this executive session after
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington gives us his P
 
05:24:42.788 --> 05:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
thank I'll make this very quick there's
 
05:24:46.150 --> 05:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
been lots of talk about uh brainwashing
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
and false information being put out by
 
05:24:51.190 --> 05:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
the evil oil companies and all that just
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
look up uh Earth Day predictions alore
 
05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
predictions we were going to have no GL
 
05:24:59.310 --> 05:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
no ice on the North Pole uh I think that
 
05:25:00.670 --> 05:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
was going to happen like five or six
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
years ago the day of no return was going
 
05:25:05.548 --> 05:25:05.558 align:start position:0%
to be sometime around 2015 if we didn't
 
05:25:08.910 --> 05:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
reduce uh greenhouse gas emission it was
 
05:25:11.070 --> 05:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the end and since then
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
we have not reduced them we've increased
 
05:25:14.350 --> 05:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
them drastically because of countries
 
05:25:16.628 --> 05:25:16.638 align:start position:0%
like India and China so I've got to take
 
05:25:18.150 --> 05:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
it a little lightly when you cut
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
everyone starts talking about all these
 
05:25:21.868 --> 05:25:21.878 align:start position:0%
all these evil people putting out all
 
05:25:23.788 --> 05:25:23.798 align:start position:0%
these evil thoughts look to your own
 
05:25:25.190 --> 05:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
side because they've been putting out
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
junk for a long time prediction after
 
05:25:29.070 --> 05:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
prediction that just doesn't come true
 
05:25:30.548 --> 05:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
and they ignore it and just move on and
 
05:25:34.350 --> 05:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
so all right I think we need to move on
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
I want to just close here by saying that
 
05:25:44.990 --> 05:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know anybody who doesn't
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
recognize that we are experiencing mild
 
05:25:52.070 --> 05:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
and minor changes to the
 
05:25:54.430 --> 05:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
climate we don't know exactly what
 
05:25:56.708 --> 05:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
causes those
 
05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
changes we also don't know what the
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
long-term impact of those changes is
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of people want to make
 
05:26:06.390 --> 05:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
predictions a lot of people do make
 
05:26:11.110 --> 05:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:13.708 --> 05:26:13.718 align:start position:0%
correct the bottom line here is that
 
05:26:15.628 --> 05:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
this is a worldwide
 
05:26:18.190 --> 05:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
phenomenon and there is very little that
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can do about it one way or
 
05:26:24.030 --> 05:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
the other whether we prepare for it or
 
05:26:26.948 --> 05:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
we don't that's going to be a
 
05:26:30.548 --> 05:26:30.558 align:start position:0%
daytoday process of
 
05:26:32.628 --> 05:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
adaptation and I don't think we need to
 
05:26:36.548 --> 05:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
waste resources studying what those
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
predictions will incor correctly
 
05:26:42.310 --> 05:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
produce so with that I would like to ask
 
05:26:45.548 --> 05:26:45.558 align:start position:0%
priv Clerk of the priv could I have a
 
05:26:48.070 --> 05:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
final word because I'd like to
 
05:26:50.670 --> 05:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
no the clerk of the committee I would
 
05:26:52.548 --> 05:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
ask him to call the role on the question
 
05:26:57.390 --> 05:26:57.400 align:start position:0%

chairman we all know that the purpose of
 
05:29:17.230 --> 05:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
a commission is to recommend future
 
05:29:19.750 --> 05:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that future legislation
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
would be carbon
 
05:29:24.270 --> 05:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
pricing the chairman chairman Bose Vice
 
05:29:26.190 --> 05:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
chairman Thomas and I have been on the
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
05:29:27.840 --> 05:29:29.310 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
since

05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
2015 in 2019 you may recall we had an
 
05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
all day hearing on carbon pricing that
 
05:29:38.788 --> 05:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
was House Bill 735
 
05:29:41.030 --> 05:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
I have it right
 
05:29:44.110 --> 05:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
here here's the testimony from that
 
05:29:48.430 --> 05:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
day put in a file folder with the uh
 
05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
Eiffel Tower as a reminder that they did
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
this in France and the people revolted
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
they took to the streets because it was
 
05:30:00.868 --> 05:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
so expensive the fiscal note I have here
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
from that
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
bill went up to $795 million that was
 
05:30:09.628 --> 05:30:09.638 align:start position:0%
the price tag we never had the debate on
 
05:30:12.110 --> 05:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
the house floor because the chairman at
 
05:30:15.628 --> 05:30:15.638 align:start position:0%
the time Bob bakis tabled the
 
05:30:17.910 --> 05:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill in the hearing
 
05:30:20.788 --> 05:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
today we heard testimony that the town
 
05:30:22.430 --> 05:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
of miramac wants
 
05:30:26.190 --> 05:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
this well I was there at that that town
 
05:30:28.230 --> 05:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
meeting and let me tell you something
 
05:30:30.628 --> 05:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
about the town elections in miramac
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
hardly anybody goes to them hardly it's
 
05:30:35.548 --> 05:30:35.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's pathetic voter apathy prevails
 
05:30:37.270 --> 05:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
unless there's a big ticket item like an
 
05:30:40.270 --> 05:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
enormously expensive SAU
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
building in a fall election that's when
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
the people come out to vote
 
05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
town it's it's really not there so if
 
05:30:49.948 --> 05:30:49.958 align:start position:0%
climate change and carbon pricing were
 
05:30:51.670 --> 05:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
the number one issue in
 
05:30:53.830 --> 05:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
marac then the sponsored this bill would
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
have top the ticket and I wouldn't be
 
05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
here there's no
 
05:31:01.948 --> 05:31:01.958 align:start position:0%
National or Regional carbon pricing
 
05:31:04.350 --> 05:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
mechanisms currently before Congress and
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
none are likely in the next four years
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 306 is a duplicate of last
 
05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
year's House Bill
 
05:31:19.350 --> 05:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
372 we ited that bill last year and I
 
05:31:20.948 --> 05:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
believe we should do it again this year
 
05:31:20.958 --> 05:31:22.030 align:start position:0%
believe we should do it again this year
thank

05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:31:25.470 --> 05:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
05:31:29.110 --> 05:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas oh yes thank you Mr chair
 
05:31:31.590 --> 05:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh first of all it is uh I'm also from
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
the town of marac it is very interesting
 
05:31:36.110 --> 05:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
to hear Representatives say that we have
 
05:31:38.310 --> 05:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
voter apathy and that our town elections
 
05:31:41.190 --> 05:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
are pathetic I will make sure that uh
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
that message gets back uh Mr chair you
 
05:31:47.230 --> 05:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
asked um when I was testifying if this
 
05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
was the same bill that was passed as
 
05:31:52.948 --> 05:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
last term and I answered that yes it was
 
05:31:55.390 --> 05:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
um and that is because people are
 
05:31:58.670 --> 05:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
begging us to pay attention they are
 
05:32:01.070 --> 05:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
begging us to recognize that carbon
 
05:32:04.430 --> 05:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
pricing is seen as something that is
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
that is coming down the road and it is
 
05:32:10.350 --> 05:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
going to impact our economy in New
 
05:32:12.830 --> 05:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I know that every time we call
 
05:32:15.310 --> 05:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
it carbon pricing you guys call it
 
05:32:18.070 --> 05:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
carbon tax because you know that tax is
 
05:32:22.030 --> 05:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
the evil word um this is not a tax on
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
energy this is a tax on
 
05:32:28.990 --> 05:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
polluters um it's and and the the intent
 
05:32:32.190 --> 05:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
is for climate protections we also know
 
05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
that in the case of of Canada people are
 
05:32:37.510 --> 05:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
getting rebates from these from these uh
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
from the carbon uh pricing it is just
 
05:32:44.190 --> 05:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
this this conversation piggybacks on the
 
05:32:47.708 --> 05:32:47.718 align:start position:0%
one that we just had we are closing our
 
05:32:50.110 --> 05:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
eyes to something that is out there
 
05:32:53.190 --> 05:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
something that is going to happen
 
05:32:54.750 --> 05:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
something that is going to greatly
 
05:32:58.270 --> 05:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
affect our economy and we need to to
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
take a look at it thank
 
05:33:03.628 --> 05:33:03.638 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:33:06.868 --> 05:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Summers thank
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
um while while I do hear the argument
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
that uh folks are begging for the uh for
 
05:33:18.070 --> 05:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
this bill to come back for the uh for
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
carbon uh carbon pricing increase I've
 
05:33:24.270 --> 05:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
also probably had just as many if not
 
05:33:27.910 --> 05:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
more constituents ask and beg for lower
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
fuel prices lower electrical rates and
 
05:33:34.270 --> 05:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
lower uh um energy alog together so this
 
05:33:40.150 --> 05:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:43.948 --> 05:33:43.958 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr chair um
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's interesting we've been talking
 
05:33:48.310 --> 05:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
about carbon pricing uh almost since
 
05:33:50.670 --> 05:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
I've been on this committee I've spoken
 
05:33:52.350 --> 05:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
in the well about it a couple of times
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
and the one overriding factor that I
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
keep reading about is Europe is years
 
05:34:00.830 --> 05:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
ahead of us in carbon pricing they've
 
05:34:04.110 --> 05:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
been doing it for a long time as uh my
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
good friend representative noted uh
 
05:34:09.310 --> 05:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough
 
05:34:11.670 --> 05:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
the uh emissions haven't gone down
 
05:34:13.390 --> 05:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
enough to cause any appreciable
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
difference in the rate of increase in
 
05:34:18.190 --> 05:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
the temperature of the the atmosphere
 
05:34:21.548 --> 05:34:21.558 align:start position:0%
and uh that begs me to wonder just how
 
05:34:23.868 --> 05:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
effective carbon pricing is now I have
 
05:34:27.548 --> 05:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
read uh several uh reports from
 
05:34:31.270 --> 05:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
institutions uh many economists agree
 
05:34:34.948 --> 05:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
that car carbon pricing could work in
 
05:34:37.030 --> 05:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of carbon in the air
 
05:34:38.510 --> 05:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
if that's what you wanted to do if it
 
05:34:41.868 --> 05:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
was effective but almost all of them say
 
05:34:44.708 --> 05:34:44.718 align:start position:0%
that it would be at such a high cost it
 
05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
would be politically and legislatively
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
impossible to pass the costs the
 
05:34:55.070 --> 05:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
economic costs to uh fuels would be so
 
05:34:57.548 --> 05:34:57.558 align:start position:0%
high as to people would Rebel as we're
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing around the world they're starting
 
05:35:02.230 --> 05:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
to do now and any costs that are lower
 
05:35:05.030 --> 05:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
than that threshold really wouldn't have
 
05:35:08.070 --> 05:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that much of an effect so I stand by
 
05:35:11.590 --> 05:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
those stats saying that carbon pricing
 
05:35:14.590 --> 05:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
is a great way to raise money for for
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
countries and that they have done and
 
05:35:19.708 --> 05:35:19.718 align:start position:0%
what they can do with that money they
 
05:35:22.270 --> 05:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
like to have a lot of money but as far
 
05:35:25.830 --> 05:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
as affecting our environment uh the jury
 
05:35:28.708 --> 05:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
is still out on that but we do know that
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
if you follow the money it's a lot of
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
people that are in favor of that so uh I
 
05:35:34.708 --> 05:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
think we're doing the right thing here
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:41.788 --> 05:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I've s I've heard a couple of
 
05:35:47.150 --> 05:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh comments here that don't really
 
05:35:49.708 --> 05:35:49.718 align:start position:0%
relate to the bill or the intent of the
 
05:35:52.868 --> 05:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill um I I think the one thing everyone
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
on the committee agrees with is that we
 
05:35:59.190 --> 05:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to lower people's
 
05:36:02.990 --> 05:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
costs for energy and figure out bills
 
05:36:05.548 --> 05:36:05.558 align:start position:0%
that we can pass that actually help us
 
05:36:08.430 --> 05:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
to support people keeping their costs
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
low I I think this bill intends to have
 
05:36:15.310 --> 05:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
us become more educated I'll use
 
05:36:18.750 --> 05:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
representative ammon's language and say
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's a sunlight bill right it's it's a
 
05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill that would answer questions that
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
people have around carbon pricing that
 
05:36:30.270 --> 05:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
is coming all around us and what effect
 
05:36:33.470 --> 05:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
that might have on us we don't know
 
05:36:35.430 --> 05:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
what's going to raise our costs or lower
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
our costs if we don't bother to look at
 
05:36:40.670 --> 05:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
it and this Bill is saying this stuff is
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
all around us everybody in North America
 
05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
is pricing their carbon products and
 
05:36:48.750 --> 05:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
we're not uh and most of our major
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
trading partners are are pricing carbon
 
05:36:54.430 --> 05:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
into their products and they're also
 
05:36:56.070 --> 05:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
going to start charging people who are
 
05:36:59.430 --> 05:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
not participating in that carbon Market
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay so it's an entire Market we are not
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
participating this bill doesn't say we
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
need to participate it says we need to
 
05:37:10.350 --> 05:37:10.360 align:start position:0%
to know what's going on and we need to
 
05:37:12.150 --> 05:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
understand how it will impact people's
 
05:37:14.990 --> 05:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
costs here and if we don't have that
 
05:37:17.430 --> 05:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
information can't make good decisions
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
can't make future future legislation but
 
05:37:22.270 --> 05:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
if you kill the bill here in its infancy
 
05:37:23.788 --> 05:37:23.798 align:start position:0%
before we've actually had a chance to
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
study it then we have no more
 
05:37:27.548 --> 05:37:27.558 align:start position:0%
information and it's just one more year
 
05:37:30.990 --> 05:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
of DeLay So this is not the same as 7:35
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
I was here for
 
05:37:36.628 --> 05:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
735 that bill was talking about adopting
 
05:37:38.830 --> 05:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing and everyone thought that
 
05:37:40.510 --> 05:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
it was untenable for New Hampshire to
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
try and make a move like that on its own
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
it wasn't wasn't really the right
 
05:37:47.230 --> 05:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle and it it didn't make sense and
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah it was killed on our committee
 
05:37:50.040 --> 05:37:51.030 align:start position:0%
so yeah it was killed on our committee
by

05:37:51.030 --> 05:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:37:53.470 --> 05:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
democrats so that's not what we're
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do here what we're trying to
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
do is say we should study this because
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's coming whether we're looking you
 
05:38:01.628 --> 05:38:01.638 align:start position:0%
know walking to the mountain top to look
 
05:38:05.230 --> 05:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
and see if the Indians are coming or
 
05:38:08.788 --> 05:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
not representative Kaplan
 
05:38:10.030 --> 05:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yeah I just want to
 
05:38:11.788 --> 05:38:11.798 align:start position:0%
piggyback on representative McGee's
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
comments they're so they're so apt um
 
05:38:16.830 --> 05:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
and I just also want to commend my
 
05:38:18.910 --> 05:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
Republican colleagues for their concern
 
05:38:20.430 --> 05:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
on the environment and the possible
 
05:38:23.910 --> 05:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
impacts of of a carbon pricing mechanism
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
um I would just say that if we do want
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
to lower carbon emissions and have a
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
positive impact on our environment this
 
05:38:34.230 --> 05:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
that we should at least look at what
 
05:38:36.350 --> 05:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
other countries are doing because that's
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
why they enacted a car carbon pricing
 
05:38:40.628 --> 05:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
mechanism so if it's not working there
 
05:38:42.548 --> 05:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh as representative Thomas suggested we
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
ought to know about it something the
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
commission uh of of this sort would find
 
05:38:49.510 --> 05:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
out so again this is just uh you know
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
sunlight as uh represent McGee said it's
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
information it's Gathering and it's uh
 
05:38:58.868 --> 05:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
it's something we ought to do if we
 
05:39:04.030 --> 05:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:06.708 --> 05:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
future the voters of New Hampshire have
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
been telling the governors and the
 
05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
representatives that they
 
05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
elect since the
 
05:39:18.430 --> 05:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
1950s that they do not want a sales tax
 
05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
an income tax or any other kind of
 
05:39:21.240 --> 05:39:23.670 align:start position:0%
an income tax or any other kind of
broad-based

05:39:23.670 --> 05:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
broad-based
 
05:39:26.830 --> 05:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
tax National surveys consistently have
 
05:39:30.590 --> 05:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
shown over the last 25 years that 60% of
 
05:39:35.430 --> 05:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:37.868 --> 05:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
tax this is not something our
 
05:39:40.390 --> 05:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
constituents want us to
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
do therefore I recommend that we don't
 
05:39:42.958 --> 05:39:43.830 align:start position:0%
do therefore I recommend that we don't
do

05:39:43.830 --> 05:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:39:46.990 --> 05:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
this is there any further
 
05:39:48.990 --> 05:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
05:39:50.548 --> 05:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
 
05:39:55.190 --> 05:39:55.200 align:start position:0%

10 before I announce
 
05:40:55.670 --> 05:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
the result of the election I'd point out
 
05:40:58.510 --> 05:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
that a yes or a no is sufficient for
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
your vote we don't need any other words
 
05:41:06.150 --> 05:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
or adjectives appended to your vote so

session on House Bill 526 FN
 
05:41:51.788 --> 05:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
establishing a CH climate change and
 
05:41:54.150 --> 05:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
damage division in the Department of
 
05:41:57.030 --> 05:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and I recognize
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative nder for a motion thank
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I move itl I recognize
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative schneller second moved
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
and seconded that we adopt the motion of
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
itl on House Bill 526 FM representative
 
05:42:17.030 --> 05:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
nter thank you Mr chairman very simple
 
05:42:19.708 --> 05:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
it it creates a new department that we
 
05:42:23.150 --> 05:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
cannot afford so I know the opposition
 
05:42:25.788 --> 05:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
will disagree with that but um that's my
 
05:42:29.270 --> 05:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
statement and simple as
 
05:42:32.830 --> 05:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
that representative schneller uh this
 
05:42:35.270 --> 05:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
assumes climate damage that has not yet
 
05:42:38.270 --> 05:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
been seen thank you
 
05:42:38.280 --> 05:42:39.430 align:start position:0%
been seen thank you
further

05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:42:42.750 --> 05:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
comment representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:42:46.030 --> 05:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I would like to uh refute that
 
05:42:47.948 --> 05:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
previous uh statement by saying this is
 
05:42:51.070 --> 05:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
something we can't afford not to do um
 
05:42:53.230 --> 05:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
as far as a climate damage that we
 
05:42:56.788 --> 05:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that um that I I don't
 
05:42:58.270 --> 05:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
understand that statement because we
 
05:43:01.548 --> 05:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
have seen um with increased flooding in
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
the summer we have seen roads wash out
 
05:43:06.350 --> 05:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
that are costing our state millions of
 
05:43:09.070 --> 05:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
dollars as the temperature gets up
 
05:43:11.628 --> 05:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
higher in the summer as we all know
 
05:43:13.270 --> 05:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
those of us that have taken science you
 
05:43:15.310 --> 05:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
know that warm air contains more
 
05:43:17.310 --> 05:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
moisture which is why we're seeing so
 
05:43:20.430 --> 05:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
much flooding in the summer we're seeing
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh decreased snow in the winter uh
 
05:43:27.390 --> 05:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's affecting our uh tourist industry
 
05:43:30.750 --> 05:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
the snow um the skiing industry is is
 
05:43:34.468 --> 05:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
hurting um again we we seem to be on a
 
05:43:36.830 --> 05:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
roll with these um the tourists that
 
05:43:39.788 --> 05:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
come up for our our Lakes our the W the
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
standing bodies of water are getting
 
05:43:43.150 --> 05:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
warmer we're getting
 
05:43:46.390 --> 05:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria which are toxic blooms
 
05:43:49.670 --> 05:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
that impede enjoying the
 
05:43:52.670 --> 05:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
Lakes um to say that you're not we're
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
also seeing droughts there's no doubt in
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
my mind that we're going to be seeing uh
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
wildfires uh very soon um to say that
 
05:44:04.110 --> 05:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
climate change hasn't caused any damage
 
05:44:07.830 --> 05:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
is to be irresponsible thank you
 
05:44:10.270 --> 05:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
05:44:13.390 --> 05:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman yeah I I
 
05:44:15.190 --> 05:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
have to agree with uh representative
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas I mean we're we're seeing
 
05:44:19.830 --> 05:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
all sorts of damage whether it's uh in
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
in my area of the Upper Valley where
 
05:44:24.468 --> 05:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
we've been having significant flooding
 
05:44:26.670 --> 05:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
events uh what's happened on the Sea
 
05:44:30.590 --> 05:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
Coast we haven't had the wildfires here
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
yet but we sure get the smoke from them
 
05:44:35.788 --> 05:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
especially from our neighbors to the
 
05:44:38.708 --> 05:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
north um I mentioned the ski industry
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
before uh so Jessica Keeler from ski New
 
05:44:44.150 --> 05:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire says we deal with factors that
 
05:44:46.270 --> 05:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
include extreme weather such as droughts
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
that impact our ability to make snow
 
05:44:50.708 --> 05:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
like some ski areas experien this year
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
or flooding which has wreak havoc either
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
on ski area infrastructure or the roads
 
05:44:58.350 --> 05:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
and bridges that lead to the ski areas
 
05:45:00.548 --> 05:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
or heavy rains when it should be snowing
 
05:45:02.548 --> 05:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
or a season in which we do open late
 
05:45:04.628 --> 05:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
because of unseasonable temperatures or
 
05:45:06.548 --> 05:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
close earlier than expected for the same
 
05:45:08.830 --> 05:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
reason in the spring particularly when
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
it gets warm earlier in the spring it
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
becomes harder to convince people to ski
 
05:45:14.468 --> 05:45:14.478 align:start position:0%
because they're already thinking about
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
other outdoor activities so we're seeing
 
05:45:18.948 --> 05:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
the effect on our tourism industry we're
 
05:45:20.910 --> 05:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
seeing the effect just in general we're
 
05:45:23.788 --> 05:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
seeing it in the air it it it's
 
05:45:27.430 --> 05:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
happening and uh again to deny it we're
 
05:45:29.430 --> 05:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
just putting our heads in the sand and
 
05:45:33.708 --> 05:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:37.350 --> 05:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
ostes I agree it's happening
 
05:45:39.150 --> 05:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
I disagree that it's climate I think
 
05:45:41.788 --> 05:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
it's weather that's what's happening
 
05:45:41.798 --> 05:45:44.030 align:start position:0%
it's weather that's what's happening
representative

05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:46.910 --> 05:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I agree with you Mr chairman
 
05:45:49.548 --> 05:45:49.558 align:start position:0%
the worst and the hottest days in the
 
05:45:52.110 --> 05:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
United States on record were in the
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
1930s the Dust Bowl not
 
05:45:58.150 --> 05:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
now the greatest floods in New Hampshire
 
05:45:59.628 --> 05:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
occurred in the
 
05:46:01.910 --> 05:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
1950s not
 
05:46:03.708 --> 05:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
now the
 
05:46:07.110 --> 05:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
worst Coastal storm
 
05:46:09.788 --> 05:46:09.798 align:start position:0%
that we've had
 
05:46:09.798 --> 05:46:14.070 align:start position:0%
that we've had
recently

05:46:14.070 --> 05:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.070 --> 05:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
1978 so we are not seeing a continual
 
05:46:20.430 --> 05:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
trend of
 
05:46:23.430 --> 05:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophism year after year after year
 
05:46:27.468 --> 05:46:27.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
premise representative
 
05:46:33.910 --> 05:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
Summers not to dispute or argue this
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
debate this debate will continue to go
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
on however if we really wanted to make a
 
05:46:41.548 --> 05:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
change on on climate change and we were
 
05:46:43.548 --> 05:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
really serious about it and we really
 
05:46:45.150 --> 05:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to effect that where
 
05:46:47.468 --> 05:46:47.478 align:start position:0%
something would actually take effect now
 
05:46:49.708 --> 05:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
I know how the opposite party at least
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
nationally is against tariffs however
 
05:46:55.548 --> 05:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
imposing a 100% tariff on China and
 
05:46:58.628 --> 05:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
India for climate change and imposing
 
05:47:01.590 --> 05:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
that they do something about their 85%
 
05:47:04.390 --> 05:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
the pollution that is in the world then
 
05:47:05.990 --> 05:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
we would have according to what I last
 
05:47:08.708 --> 05:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
testified under the scientific method
 
05:47:10.910 --> 05:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
then we would have proof If the climate
 
05:47:14.110 --> 05:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
actually did go down or get better
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
because of their drop of the 85% the
 
05:47:19.910 --> 05:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
problem then maybe this would prove not
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
only that it is an actual issue but
 
05:47:24.788 --> 05:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
you'd be actually attacking the actual
 
05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
cause of the bulk of the problem
 
05:47:29.628 --> 05:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the little State of New
 
05:47:32.350 --> 05:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or even like I said going
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
taking us all the way down to zero will
 
05:47:37.150 --> 05:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
have almost no effect compared to the
 
05:47:39.788 --> 05:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
85% of India and China so we actually
 
05:47:42.670 --> 05:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
have to tax the actual problem cause
 
05:47:44.510 --> 05:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
them some pain over it if you really
 
05:47:46.590 --> 05:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
want to make a ground effect on climate
 
05:47:47.990 --> 05:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
change and you really think it's a
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
severe issue and more than just in a
 
05:47:52.030 --> 05:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
religion but scientific fact you would
 
05:47:54.150 --> 05:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
actually attack China and India
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
nationally instead of trying to do it at
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:03.910 --> 05:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
area representative
 
05:48:06.430 --> 05:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I got two words for you
 
05:48:08.350 --> 05:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing mechanisms three that's
 
05:48:10.390 --> 05:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
three words but I'm surprised you voted
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
against it that's exactly what you're
 
05:48:15.270 --> 05:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
talking about this taxing other
 
05:48:17.110 --> 05:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
countries for their carbon content
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we were talking about in the
 
05:48:22.830 --> 05:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:25.708 --> 05:48:25.718 align:start position:0%
um Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:48:28.230 --> 05:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'd like to pay you back on
 
05:48:30.310 --> 05:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
a major Point made by representative
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
Bernardi something that I think people
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
now um may not have realized
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
but consider now with all of the
 
05:48:43.548 --> 05:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
informational structure we have out
 
05:48:46.270 --> 05:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
there social media and the amount of
 
05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
population and buildings and and
 
05:48:50.910 --> 05:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we have now as
 
05:48:54.868 --> 05:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
opposed to say back in the 1930s uh uh
 
05:48:57.910 --> 05:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
1950s the weather the the extreme
 
05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
weathers have happened all throughout
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
our history but the effects the economic
 
05:49:07.510 --> 05:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
effects are in people people's minds
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
much more vast now because of the E we
 
05:49:11.948 --> 05:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
have more population we have more
 
05:49:14.030 --> 05:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
buildings the cost factors are more
 
05:49:16.430 --> 05:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
because of inflation and so forth and so
 
05:49:20.468 --> 05:49:20.478 align:start position:0%
on so it seems to people here now that
 
05:49:22.868 --> 05:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we're having this
 
05:49:26.390 --> 05:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
climate change or this weather change in
 
05:49:29.590 --> 05:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
my opinion I believe that the sure the
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
effects nowadays are more stringent
 
05:49:34.310 --> 05:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
because we have more out there that's
 
05:49:37.430 --> 05:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
being affected by these Chang but the
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
actual weather pattern seems to be
 
05:49:41.788 --> 05:49:41.798 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent over the last several
 
05:49:45.070 --> 05:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
hundred years so I would caution people
 
05:49:47.788 --> 05:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
as to making the leaping Assumption of
 
05:49:51.070 --> 05:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
the cause and effects and instead I
 
05:49:53.230 --> 05:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
think people should just go out there
 
05:49:55.230 --> 05:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
and say look every so often we're going
 
05:49:57.510 --> 05:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
to have a bad winter a bad summer a bad
 
05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
flood whatever maybe take it upon
 
05:50:02.510 --> 05:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
themselves to figure out how things
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
should should be uh uh prepared for that
 
05:50:09.070 --> 05:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
instead of subjecting economies to a lot
 
05:50:11.830 --> 05:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
of expenses on things the weather that
 
05:50:14.270 --> 05:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
we really have no real control over uh
 
05:50:17.868 --> 05:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:21.350 --> 05:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
basis so you're saying we have to avoid
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
falling victim to
 
05:50:26.310 --> 05:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
presentism evaluating everything that
 
05:50:29.868 --> 05:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
happens according to what we see in the
 
05:50:33.430 --> 05:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
present when in fact the past may
 
05:50:36.670 --> 05:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
contain or may have seen events that
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
were much more traumatic than what we're
 
05:50:38.558 --> 05:50:42.190 align:start position:0%
were much more traumatic than what we're
seeing

05:50:42.190 --> 05:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:45.190 --> 05:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
today TS Elliot
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
said human beings have a limited
 
05:50:52.468 --> 05:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
reality and I think a lot of
 
05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
our disagreement about climate
 
05:51:01.868 --> 05:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
change is
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
because we all
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
struggle with figuring out what's real
 
05:51:11.430 --> 05:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:13.230 --> 05:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
reality I don't know that we're going to
 
05:51:16.030 --> 05:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
be able to figure it out here in this
 
05:51:16.040 --> 05:51:17.110 align:start position:0%
be able to figure it out here in this
executive

05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
executive
 
05:51:19.628 --> 05:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
session but I think we should avoid
 
05:51:22.030 --> 05:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
doing anything
 
05:51:26.670 --> 05:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
that puts our constituents at the
 
05:51:29.230 --> 05:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
risk of energy
 
05:51:32.190 --> 05:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
poverty puts our constituents at the
 
05:51:34.708 --> 05:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
risk of
 
05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
being made poor
 
05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
by bad decisions that we make In the
 
05:51:42.190 --> 05:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
Heat of the
 
05:51:45.468 --> 05:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
Moment so I'd like to ask the clerk to
 
05:51:47.548 --> 05:51:47.558 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr chairman before
 
05:53:13.948 --> 05:53:13.958 align:start position:0%
we break yes um I had asked the um our
 
05:53:17.670 --> 05:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
secretary to pull put together copies of
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and they stopped somewhere along
 
05:53:20.910 --> 05:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
here they didn't keep coming so if we
 
05:53:22.830 --> 05:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
could get those for how folks are going
 
05:53:24.788 --> 05:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
to change their email
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
address so it has been asking us to do
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
