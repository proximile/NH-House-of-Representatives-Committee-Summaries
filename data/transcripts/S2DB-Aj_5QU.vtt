um especially regarding your um agen

agriculture
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
um let's start broadly what is a rule
 
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
it's basically a
 
00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
requirement um adopted by an agency
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
um it uh means each regulation standard
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
form um or other statement of General
 
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
applicability adopted by an agency to a
 
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
Implement interpret or make specific a
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
statute inforced or administered by such
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
agency or B prescribed or interpret an
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
agency policy procedure or practice
 
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's binding on purpose uh persons
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
outside the
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
agency uh there are 10 basic Ru making
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
principles U they come about mostly from
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
legal cases or directly from RSA 541a
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
which is the administrative procedures
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
act um rulle making is lawmaking with
 
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.629 align:start position:0%
act um rulle making is lawmaking with
legislative

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
oversight um rule making Authority comes
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
only from the legislature either in a
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
statute or session law and it's not
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
inherent with the
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
agency rules have the force and effect
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
of law if validly adopted and filed and
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
and if they have not expired and they
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
shall not be enforced
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise Ru making may not modify
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
statutory law that is the statutes
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
always Trump the rules Ru making by
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
agencies is governed by RSA 541a and
 
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.029 align:start position:0%

less

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
Exempted uh and agent agency is an
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
entity a rule is a rule by what it does
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh even it's even if it's not called a
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
rule um the example that we give uh is a
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
legal case asmussen versus Commissioner
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
of Department of Safety which is over 20
 
00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
years old um in that case the department
 
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
I think the commissioner was not happy
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
with the U rate of findings of guilt for
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh administrative license suspensions
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
people would have been stopped for that
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
they will come in for a hearing and
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner felt I assume it was a
 
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner um felt that there wasn't
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
high enough conviction rate so the a
 
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
memo was put out to all the hearings
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
officers and they have I don't know six
 
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
or eight hearings officers that hear
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
these cases um and it said the hearing
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
officers shall do certain things uh for
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
example it said if police officer cannot
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
make it to the hearing then the meeting
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
would be continued if the
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
uh defendant does not show up then
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
there'll be a finding against the
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
defendant well you know maybe that's
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
fine in principle but it wasn't the only
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
people that knew this were the hearings
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
examiners and requirements like that
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
obviously affected people outside the
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
department uh it someone sued it went to
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court court and they said a
 
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
rule is a rule whether you've adopted it
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
or not and you can't uh implement it if
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
you have not adopted it through the
 
00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:40.189 align:start position:0%
you have not adopted it through the
regular

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
regular
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
process and by the way feel free to
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
interject anytime you want Mr moral

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
little bit about what office you're from
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
and what your background is before we
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
get into yep thank you I'm the director
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
of the uh administr administrative rules
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
office which is part of office of
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislative Services um I have been here
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
about 31 years first as a committee
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
attorney then Senior attorney and then
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
for the last two years as a
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
director um I have done both sides
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
because when I was a legal intern back
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
in 85 to 887 I uh worked for the
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and helped do their
 
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
rules thank you
 
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.589 align:start position:0%
rules thank you
yep

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
um some of these uh basic rule making
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
principles came from an opinion of the
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
justices in
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
1981 uh the legislature adopted the
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act RSA 541a
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
1973 um but it really had no teeth so uh
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
the legislature inquired of the Supreme
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
Sue Court as to what they could do could
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
they have a committee of the legislature
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
that uh voted up or down on the rule and
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
the court said no because the
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
legislature as a whole had granted the
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
rul making authority to the department
 
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
to have a single committee say no we
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
don't like that rule uh we don't think
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
it uh conforms to legislative intent
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
then you basically have a pocket veto so
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
um so Jael car The Joint legislative
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules was
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
two years later uh created by
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
Statute it's a statutory sub uh
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
committee it's uh five regular me uh
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
five regular members from the house five
 
00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
regular members from the Senate and five
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
alternates from each body um they are
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
not a policy committee they are an
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
oversight committee it can be difficult
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
some times for them to switch hats from
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
policy makers to oversight but they work
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
very hard at that and try not to
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
substitute their opinion for what the
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has put in statute their
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
power is limited in that um they can
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
object based on four reasons if they
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
object they can enter a well I should
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
stop and go through the process um when
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
an agency wants to do a rule it will
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
draft up the text um as you know with
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of envir Environmental
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
Services they often engage uh people
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
that will be affected prior to the rulem
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
or during that Ru making hearing when an
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
agency does a rule it's required by law
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
to have a public hearing the public
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
hearing is at least three weeks after
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
they've published notice in the
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
rulemaking register the register is
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
something that's put out by our office
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
every week every Thursday uh you should
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
be all getting a copy uh via
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
email there has now for over year been a
 
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
link in the register so that you can
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
actually look at the text of the rule
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
um after their agency submits their
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
notice we review it and before they
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
submit their notice they have to go to
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
the LBA and fill out a form for the LBA
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
saying what the costs and benefits of
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
the rule are uh
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
and the LBA then uses that information
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
to publish a fiscal impact statement
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
which the agency files with us as part
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
of its notice uh the rule making notice
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
form which explains the rule says when
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing is uh says when the written
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
comment deadline is and includes
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
includes the fiscal impact statement
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
um then they have their public hearing
 
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
which as I said is at least three weeks
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
later later um they usually put post
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
that on their own websites um but there
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
is no requirement to post at any place
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
but the rulemaking register which I
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
think personally is not the best way
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
because most of the public does not get
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
the uh ruem
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
register um they are also obliged to
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
notify anybody that has uh informed them
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
that they would like to be notified of
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
any Ru making in a given
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
area so then the agency has its public
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
hearing sometimes they have more than
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
one if it's a really hot topic uh
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
education has got a couple of rules
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
right now that there's a lot of public
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
interests and they had a couple of
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
hearings on one of them uh Dees
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
occasionally does that uh they can
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
either do do it twice during the formal
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
process or they can have a pre- Ru
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
they take that import and draft a final
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
proposal based on public comments and
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
based on comments from my office uh we
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
make comments on everything from grammar
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
all the way to constitutional issues uh
 
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
we look particularly at the four bases
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
for the that the that jel car can object
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
to um which are
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
Authority does he does the agency have
 
00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:33.790 align:start position:0%
Authority does he does the agency have
rulemaking

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
authority uh legislative intent which is
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
a big one um a lot of the comments we
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
make about legislative intent involve
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
conflicts with RSA 541a if they've
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
missed a step that they're supposed to
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
take under that statute we'll make a
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
comment if the rule is simply unclear
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
well there's a requirement in 541a that
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
it be clear um they're also required to
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
comply with the rulemaking manual which
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
is about 175 page manual that all
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
agencies have to for uh follow because
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be uniform set of rules
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
so if you went from one agency to the
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
other you would know uh generally how to
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
find something and how it would be
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
written instead of having a over a
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
hundred different methods um it's sort
 
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
of like writing statutes they're all
 
00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:27.150 align:start position:0%
of like writing statutes they're all
fairly

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
uniform um committee can also object
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
based on public interest and you say
 
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
well how can they do that if they're not
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
a policy committee um they can do that
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
because in their own rules which is
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
attached to the rulemaking manual um
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
they are very limited in what they can
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
do for contrary to public interest if
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
the rule is unclear and people can't
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
understand what it says then it's
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
contrary to public interest if the rule
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
can't be uniform formally enforced then
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's contrary to public interest um
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
there are other couple smaller ones the
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
final basis for objection is um a
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
violation of fiscal impact statement in
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
other words a fiscal impact statement
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
says uh a B and C are the costs and D is
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the proposed rule well
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
they forgot to mention the fee they've
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
put in the rules um which obviously is
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
going to have an imp act but
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
fee and after the final proposals
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
drafted and submitted to us we also re
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
review the final proposal we every time
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
they file with us we review at least
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
twice to make sure we haven't missed
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
anything we still do but we do the best
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
um So based on our com comments in the
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
Public's they draft their final proposal
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
they submit it to us um they have up to
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
180 days to file the final proposal so
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
they can take quite a while to uh do it
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
that amount of time is really needed
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
because of some of the boards uh there
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
are boards in the state that only meet
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
once every three months so it's
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to go through the rul
 
00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
making process in statutory time and
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
repres yeah I just wanted to because I
 
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:24.230 align:start position:0%
repres yeah I just wanted to because I
want

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
toite one second for question go
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you and I hope if this is
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's better to have this question
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
answered later let me know but I'm I'm
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
curious about learning more about
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and what that entails
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about an
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
executive department and an executive
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
department right is subject to the
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
political pressures of the executive but
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in how legislative intent
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
is ascertained right because you've got
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
the legislation that is on the books but
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
then you also have for example a a a
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
clear history in this case of this body
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
being on record for example with regard
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
to landfill sighting these are bills
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
that were vetoed for example by the
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
governor right so I I'm just curious
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
about like how specifically legislative
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
intent is discerned I was going to do
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
that after the general overview if
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's okay yes thank you very much okay
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
mine is just about this so time frame
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
wise I just want to if you can just
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
succinctly so we're looking at um the
 
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
the notice goes out yeah once they file
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
the notice with us clock starts um and
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
that notice was we were all just noticed
 
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
of that yes okay and they have and they
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
have to wait at least three weeks before
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
they can hold their public hearing yep
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then they have to wait at least
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
another five days uh generally speaking
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
U to accept written comment okay perfect
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
so notice clock starts 3 weeks of public
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
for the P to the public hearing notice
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
yep okay and
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
correct five days to
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
written generally that is technically
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions can uh do vote on
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
their final proposal at the end of the
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing process most because of
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
past experiences try not to do that
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
because it raises the question well how
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
much you taking into account the public
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
testimony if you've already got the
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
final proposal
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
drafted that has run into problems
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
before okay so yeah so I'm thinking so
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing to final proposal that's
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
the time frame so what are we looking at
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
there 180 days yeah it depends on the
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
agency most of them will file
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
within the final proposal within a month
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
or two of the public hearing sometimes
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
it'll be within 10 days of the public
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
hearing um it depends on how rushed they
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
are how long the rule is a rule could be
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
a sentence or it could be 100 Pages well
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say and in this case
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's it's very long my other question
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
is okay so and I have a bill in which
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
looks like it's going to pass which is
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
fantastic that changes this a little bit
 
00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:21.799 align:start position:0%
um that gives
 
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
um public testimony uh the emphasis kind
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
of that it needs so for example
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
requiring which is kind of kind of what
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
we do here in the legislature but it
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
makes the agencies post their stuff onto
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
their website and any of the written um
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
that they could do that whether it's
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
emailed to them or scanned in which was
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
fantastic so um it's looks like it's
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
going through which is wonderful uh I
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
was just checking on it actually because
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be an exec today
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
so that won't apply probably for stuff
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
that's going on right now but um so
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing the I do know
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
that the the comments on each let's say
 
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.230 align:start position:0%
that the the comments on each let's say
substantial

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
thing we is that in that 180 days
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
because my bill changes this a little
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
bit so that's why I'm trying to
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
understand right now it's it's it's
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
really not defined y um it would yes
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
right now as of October 3rd of last year
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
yeah agencies are required to do
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh Environmental Services has done
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
for years and oplc recently because one
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
of their attorneys was it ran the legal
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
unit at Dees for decades and that is
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
every public comment they get uh they
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
list what the comment is they uh say
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
what change they're going to make
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
because of the comment or if they're not
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
going to change it they specify why and
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
with Dees it could be a citizen it could
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
be a business owner it could be a EPA
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
and they go through all of that and then
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
separately they do the same thing with
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
the comments that my office
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
provides wonderful last question um so
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
the piece that is um right now that
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying that this new legislation
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
is going to help with a little bit is
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
time frame right so you have this
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
wonderful public hearing let's say
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
there's gobs of testimony real good
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
stuff right and um and people are kind
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
of like okay well what happens now
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like where there's been a
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
black hole
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
and and my bill is trying to be able to
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
get that up online to the point where
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
and the response that Dees is going to
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
do so people have enough time to kind of
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
see where that's at before it goes
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
directly sometimes it's only five days
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
before it's going into like JL car and
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's a huge issue so to be able to
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
have that you know kind of the public
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
testimony up and the responses back so
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's more transparent because you know
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
the you know the public is you know it's
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard sometimes after you you
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
testify at a hearing even here you know
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
on the on the house side and the Senate
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
side you're kind of like okay well where
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
did that go what's the process you know
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
trying to then having to try to chase
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
down when the next hearing is or
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
executive session it's I feel as if it's
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for um our constituents
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
and you know they're the boss and so I
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
really wanted that's why this bill was
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
put in so usually right now the last
 
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
time I looked at this it was about with
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
another agency um in the kind of the
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
response back it was only like about
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
five days so that's not something right
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
now that you guys can control correct
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
right um the new process that I just
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
summarized where they do a summary of
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
the comments they are required now to
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
file that with their final proposal so
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing the comments well in
 
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing the comments well in
advance

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
advance
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh the final proposal once it's filed it
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
will go on to the next month's committee
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
meeting it has to be filed at least
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
three weeks before a jail car meeting in
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
order to be taken up that's another
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
chance for the public to see what's in
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
there uh because sometimes the changes
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
from an initial proposal to a final
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
proposal are uh significant sometimes
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
they're just minor
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
changes well that's a good thing so then
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to three weeks before the
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
first yellow JL car meeting um Meeting
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
those replies and stuff would be would
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
have to be live correct right perfect
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
and in fact in House Bill 1622 y I'm
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
from that period of three weeks will be
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
lengthened to four weeks wonderful
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's very good so basically a month
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
before they go before Jael car the
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
agency will have had to file final
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
Proposal with us that's that's wonderful
 
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
um okay the agency has filed the final
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
proposal as I said we review that twice
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh one of the committee attorneys we
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
have three committee attorneys two
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
administrative staff and
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
myself um the attorneys will go through
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
it and then I will take another look at
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
it to see if there's anything that was
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
missed those comments then go out to the
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
agency they are available to the public
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
um agency's required to if anybody makes
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
a request they're required to give them
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
copies of anything that's been filed
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
initial proposal rule making notice form
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh final
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
proposal uh so we com comment it and
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
then the final proposal goes to Jael car
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
um when it does go to jel car the agency
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
would be there the at jel car's meeting
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
and we would be there we're their
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
counsel by Statute um and we would raise
 
00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:09.799 align:start position:0%
the more significant points to them
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
regarding the rule we don't bother with
 
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
the editorial stuff we might make a lot
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
of editorial things well you used a
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
period here and it was supposed to be a
 
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
semicolon uh You misspelled this word uh
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
but the committee doesn't want to deal
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
with that I mean technically those
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
things violate the manual and they could
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
object on but they're not of importance
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
enough to do that so the committee
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
listens to the agency and to us uh if
 
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.870 align:start position:0%
listens to the agency and to us uh if
they're

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
satisfied in first the committee is not
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
required to make an objection there
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
could be something fairly black and
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
white but there are circumstances
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
outside uh that they decide not to
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
object say Dees needs to get a rule in
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
by a certain date or are they going to
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
lose Federal funding well if there's
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
anything really troubling with the rule
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
the committee would probably approve it
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
they might approve it with a
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation or understanding that the
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
agency will go back through rulemaking
 
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
to address those remaining
 
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.190 align:start position:0%
to address those remaining
issues

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
um there's also another step after the
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
final proposal agency gets our final
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
proposal comments and they said oh yeah
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
those three things they brought up yeah
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
that that's not right we should correct
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
that they can then put in what's called
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval it's basically an
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
amend to the final proposal
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
um and maybe they got late filed public
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and they want to do it that
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
maybe they noticed a mistake of their
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
own or because of one our of our
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
comments if they file one the committee
 
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
will take up take that up with a final
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
proposal um they can conditionally
 
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
approve the rule which means the agency
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
goes back and submits the exact changes
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
they said that doesn't go back to jail
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
car unless they don't do it exactly as
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
Jael car said we we simply review it in
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
my office um if there's no conditional
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
approval the committee's going to look
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
at the find well either way they're
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to look at the final proposal and
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
decide whether to approve conditionally
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
approve or enter a preliminary objection
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
if they enter a preliminary objection
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
they're saying well we think these three
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
issues um have a problem we're going to
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
enter a preliminary objection the agency
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
then has 45 days to come back to Jael
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
car uh with a preliminary objection
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
response um in which they make changes
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
or if they don't wish to make changes
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
then in a cover letter they explain why
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate to make those
 
00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:49.230 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate to make those
changes

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
um and if the jail card enters a
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection the agency comes
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
back committee can approve the rule if
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
the committee is still not satisfied
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
that they've eliminated the basis for
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
objection they can make a final
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
objection but because the committee is
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have veto power the agency still
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
can go ahead and approve the rule uh
 
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
adopt the rule over the committee's
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
final objection the final objection has
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
the effect that if commit if the agency
 
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
adopts it uh the rule over the object
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
final objection then if somebody sues
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
the agency regarding the rule the burden
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
of proof is going to to be on the agency
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
and if it gets a straight approval from
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
Jael card then there a presumption that
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
the rule is valid and the person would
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
have to go to court and prove that the
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
rules invalid but with final objection
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
switches and one final step if
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
Committee in in addition to or instead
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
of the final objection they can vote to
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor a joint
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
resolution that's where they believe
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
there's a really serious issue and they
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be addressed by the
 
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.269 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be addressed by the
entire

00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
legislature U there are time frames for
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
doing that uh if it's filed before the
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
session well I either way there's a
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
limited time for the legislature to deal
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
with that joint resolution they're
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
pretty rare they used to be common way
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
back when 25 years ago uh because after
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
28a part one article 28a of the
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution was adopted it said you
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
can't pass on cost to political
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
subdivisions if you're an
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
agency um and so the committee made
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
frequent objections with Dees about that
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
because they said well this is imposing
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
a cost on them but over the last two or
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
three decades the Supreme Court has
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much whittel down the effect of
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
uh 28a so it rarely comes up
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
anymore there was a decision called city
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
of conquered about 10 years ago that
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous really uh took the guts
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
28a yeah I perhaps I missed it but could
 
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
could you say something about the
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
conditional approval you said there's
 
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
approval there's conditional approval
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
and there's preliminary objections but
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
could you speak to what conditional
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
approval means okay uh you've submitted
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
the final
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
proposal we have reviewed it uh made
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
comments and the agency said yeah we
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
need to fix this so they ask for a
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
conditional approval they basically
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
bring up another copy of the text
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
showing further changes uh to correct
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
the problem uh maybe Jael car said well
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have author Authority for this
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph So the agency might agree and
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
decide to take out that paragraph and
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
the committee would look at the
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and say yes or no
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
um and that that's basically that
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
process the additional approval is filed
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
with our office we review that just like
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
we do the final proposal and tell the
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
committee whether we think the process
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
and whether the problems have been
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
eliminated and and at that point then it
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
becomes approved once the conditions are
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
met then it's approved the conditional
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
approval Goes to Jail car and jail car
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
can say yeah this cleaned up the issues
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
that were raised back the jail car for
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
round two to sort out the condition yeah
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
it goes there with the final proposal
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the agent the committee can say well
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
between the final proposal and the
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
further changes you made in the
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
conditional approval then we think the
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
rule is okay but they can decide that
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
the uh conditional approval doesn't do
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
enough to eliminate the issues so
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
they'll do a preliminary objection based
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
on the final proposal okay thank
 
00:31:52.639 --> 00:31:55.710 align:start position:0%
on the final proposal okay thank
you

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh and most most of the rules agencies
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
adopt are what we call regular rules
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
those are valid for 10 years uh agencies
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of the rules we get are not
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
implementing new legislation or setting
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
a new policy they're reopt an already
 
00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:16.039 align:start position:0%
existing Rule and if say if the rule is
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
eight years old and their statute has
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
changed or they really realize they need
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
to change the process then as part of
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
reopt that rule they will also amend it
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
U that's majority of
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
ruem um there can be because of in the
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
ruem register if you look at the list of
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
new uh notices that have come in the in
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
the uh prior week if you see an asterisk
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
then the purp then that rule is
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
implementing new legislation basically
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
from the last one or two
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
sessions and that means that the
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that have been set up uh
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
to review rules uh can take a look at
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
that and say
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
yeah we think there's a legislative
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
intent uh problem here we're going to
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
tell the agency we're going to tell jail
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
car um if the agency doesn't deal with
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
it then subcommittee could be come
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
before Jael car and state their
 
00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
concerns legislative intent can be
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
really hard to nail down um some
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
statutes of Grant rule making Authority
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
are very specific and it's easy to tell
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
some of them have to be specific 541a
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
says if you're going to do a new form of
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
license a new form of fee a new
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
discipline um then you have to have
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
specific Authority in your statute it
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
has to say you shall develop uh this new
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
disciplinary measure uh if it doesn't
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
they cannot do that uh but otherwise
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
legislative intent can be difficult
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
because it might not be specific I know
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
some of the boards and commissions have
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority it says any rule
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
necessary to implement this chapter well
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
that leaves it pretty broad wide open
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
for the agency to adopt rules and in
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
that instance it can be very hard for
 
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
the committee attorneys to say whether
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
something is within legislative intent
 
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.589 align:start position:0%
something is within legislative intent
or

00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
not that can also be difficult for jail
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
cart to determine uh if we can't see
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
with legislative intent because first
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
thing you do is look at the wording of a
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
statute I mean if it's clear on its face
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
then that's what's implemented that's
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
legislative intent um if we can't tell
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
whether the a thing the agency wants to
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
adopt in their rules Falls within that
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
intent we'll try to look up uh the
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislation see what was said in
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee hearings see what was said on
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
the floor um might even involve uh
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
research office within OS to help us on
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
that uh and the agency is free you know
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
if we do raise a a legislative intent
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
issue the agency will come to jail cart
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
and explain why they believe they do
 
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.109 align:start position:0%
and explain why they believe they do
have

00:35:08.109 --> 00:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
authority and agencies are pretty good
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
about uh legislative intent uh there are
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
places where they're not absolutely sure
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
and they think what they're putting in
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
the rule is necessary to carry out the
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
program uh Jael car might disagree there
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
are times when say a commissioner really
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
wants something and maybe he's trying to
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
put a square peg in a round hole and uh
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.270 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
very much for coming to talk to us today
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
and and so this has more to do with
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and this is one of
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
those kind of I know strict
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
constructionist kind of questions in the
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
when we talk about legislative intent or
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
we talking about the intent of the
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislature that passed the law the RSA
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
or are we talking about the current
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
legislature the courts have said you
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
know it's the intent of the entire
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
legislature when they voted well frankly
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
that's hard to discern sometimes uh with
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
as many bills you have to deal with at
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
one time on the floor
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
um the intent of the sponsor might be
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
looked at but that's not uh controlling
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
neither is the uh intent of the
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
committee that you know uh did the blur
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
before the house or Senate um those
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
might be factored in
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
but so it can be hard to nail down what
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is I follow up yes
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
please U thank you and because what I'm
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
wondering is as I said I understand it's
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
it's difficult right because these
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
agencies are executive agencies ahead of
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
the agencies are appointed by the
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
governor right um and but RSA is made by
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
primarily by the legislature yeah um and
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
and so executive departments are in the
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
situation where they're between those
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
two Powers right the executive power and
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
the legislative power and my concern is
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
what happens when when rules go forward
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
that the legislature feels do not
 
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.190 align:start position:0%
that the legislature feels do not
reflect

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
feedback that it has consistently given
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
to the agency so if you've had several
 
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
bills for example that have in some
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
cases gone all the way through been
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
vetoed to me that's an expression of the
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
will of the legislature you've had an
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that has provided
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
feedback um and my concern is what
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
happens if the legislature feels that
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
its feedback has simply not been
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the rules process okay
 
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
uh smaller part of that first if the
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
legislature vetos a bill and then the
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
agency tries to implement that there's a
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
strict prohibition on it they cannot do
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
that no the
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
governor I understood what you me yeah
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that that so it is one of that it's
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
it's trying to discern if if I'm getting
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
this correctly the
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislature at the time
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
that it passed the RSA that is being
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
interpreted right uh just for an example
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
I can remember long ago because the
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
department of safety has um Marine
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
Patrol uh the upper echelon in the
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
department decided we should have an
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
auxiliary uh Marine Patrol well there
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
was nothing about it in the statute and
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
so there was a big argument in front of
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
jel car as to whether that conformed
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
with the legislative
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
intent thank you repres
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
Penza okay
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
so to understand because I'm going to go
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
back off of legis islative
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
intent in a perfect world how it's
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to work is there's current RSA
 
00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
there's a cur there's you know recent a
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
recent bill that was passed whether it
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
be a year or two ago let's say there's
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
rule making that um you know is is
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
coming up you know Ru making is not
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily happening you know every six
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
months or every year or something like
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
that okay so um so we're looking at okay
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
here's rule making is coming so we're
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to go based upon previous RSA that
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know or bills that were passed that
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
became law you know within the last
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
couple years or something like that now
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
when that that when none of that exists
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
at all we're going to have to I assume
 
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
look back to Old RSA pulling pieces from
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
other things because in a sense in in a
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
situation that we're in right now they
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
are kind of going in a sense going rogue
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have anything to basee their
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
rulemaking on legislatively
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
lawwills as he said you know that have
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
gone through have been
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
vetoed um so or maybe killed on the
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
other body or whatever it may be and so
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm a new rep so this is you know
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
um I only can talk from 23 to 24 but
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
some of this stuff has been going on for
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
five or six years now and you know even
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
longer in in certain things so to be
 
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.950 align:start position:0%
longer in in certain things so to be
able

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
able
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
to whatever they're basing their their
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
rules on it should be based upon RSA and
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
through I mean committee hearings and
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and all of these types of
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
things that where we thought things were
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
headed are not so our only Power is
 
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
really to go dig through I assume old
 
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.829 align:start position:0%
really to go dig through I assume old
RSA

00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
right to say okay this doesn't match up
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
with this that's really that that's
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
really what we should be focusing on if
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
we have a real problem with certain
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
aspects of rules and that can be
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
difficult when a bill passed 20 or 40
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
years ago what was the intent of the
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislature on that rule that's why
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
there's a limit on this new process uh
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
that involves statutory uh subcommittees
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
of the standing committees uh to recent
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislation in other words a year or two
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
out because there are going to be
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
members on that committee that are aware
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
then but it doesn't always the rul
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
making doesn't always happen immediately
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
you know we sometimes get rules that are
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
implementing statutes that were three or
 
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
old so
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
from this committee's perspective I gave
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of an outline
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh the last four months we've been
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
working with Dees to review the ru
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
making process right um the ru making
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
process has
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
gone um you know they've made a lot of
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
changes to the the rules with which
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
enhance environmental and public um
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
safety but they they have not made some
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
changes that people on this subcommittee
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
and in our committee believe are are
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
prudent and so we as the subcommittee
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
and the larger Committee of the
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
legislature what is our our recourse
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
then if we still believe at the end of
 
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:42.870 align:start position:0%
then if we still believe at the end of
the

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
day the rules that they have are not as
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
stringent as they should
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
be um from what you just talked about it
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that um we can
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
interject in that 180 days we get or and
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
and in the time leading up to the public
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
hearing okay yeah go ahead um when the
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
notice is filed uh with the initial
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
proposal in it uh anything that was
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
initial proposal that was filed after
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
October 3rd of last year is going to
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
have that summary of public comments and
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
how they reacted to it so you'll be able
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
to see that if in reading the rule you
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
see something I don't think that can
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
forms to what the statute says then uh
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
you can certainly tell the agency and
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
they can take that into account when
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
they draft their final proposal if the
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
final proposal comes up and you still
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
have concerns you can again tell the
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
agency if they don't do anything further
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
like conditional approval you can come
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
to Jael car and explain your reasoning
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
and jail car May object on that uh the
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
other option basically is is new
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislation to say do this or don't do
 
00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
that okay question representative
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
so somewhat of the
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
urgency we are experiencing is because
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's a 10-year update of the rules yep
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
so uh things
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
change new information comes about right
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
um um speaking for myself new legislator
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
am I don't see that the public in input
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
is necessarily making its way into the
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
rules and since I represent the
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
public I would love some assurance that
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
testimony is making it into the rules y
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
um I think that summary helps a lot so
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
you can see clearly whether something
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
did or not uh I'll be frank sometimes
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
public testimon want something that the
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
agency doesn't have the authority to do
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
um a new state a small state agency was
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
created recently the office of the UN
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
budsman for RSA 91a the right to no law
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh so people instead of going to court
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
if they're unhappy with the
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
decision say your local you asked for
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
information from your town they refuse
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
to give it you can go to the UN budsman
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
instead of going to court
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I know there was a lot of public
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
testimony when that agency was created
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
and on their rules and I saw some of it
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
and people were saying well you should
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
be able to do this to the governor uh
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
it's such you should be able to do this
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
which is blatantly
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so some public
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
testimony does need to be rejected but
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
your point is very well
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
taken and for a fall thank
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
you I respect that but we aren't just
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
the public we are the legislators we are
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to write the laws and as this
 
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is formed to oversee the
 
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.589 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is formed to oversee the
rul

00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
rul
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
making I am not fully sure that our
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
comments have made it into the rules as
 
00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:32.630 align:start position:0%
comments have made it into the rules as
well

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
okay right it it should be easier to be
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
able to discern now well at least if you
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
went and testified at the public hearing
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
I mean if uh you just if a
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
Dees representative came before your
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and you told them of issues
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
that you thought were there and they
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
don't address it
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
then uh there are certainly political
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
ramifications that can be made but uh
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
you you won't know until you read the
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
rule whether or not they made those
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
changes or why they didn't make the
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
changes if I may just one last
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
please and the public hearing that's
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
coming up on the 20th in regard to the
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
800 rule um has been scheduled from one
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
to 4:00 in the
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
afternoon in talking with my colleagues
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
we don't feel like we should take the
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
Public's time to
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
testify because frankly it was scheduled
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
with inefficient in insufficient time
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
for the number of people who want to
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
speak so that's just one occasion where
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like we're getting through
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
yeah there is a statutory provision that
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
says if there's not enough time at the
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
hearing for for everyone to be heard the
 
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
agency can continue the he um hearing
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
they file a form with our office
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
specifies when the additional meeting is
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to be held uh likewise you know if
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
the weather is atrocious and they can't
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
get the meeting or get a quorum Etc they
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
can be continued uh if they realize
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
there going to be 100 people showing up
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
and they just were using a boardroom
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
then they can also change the
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
venue thank
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
youza so yeah just following up on what
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
you just said um there's been some folks
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
that have already uh reached out to I
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
have as well to Dees concerning that
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
just to say that because we know that
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's not going to be sufficient
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
um should we you know in a sense you
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
know whether it be our subcommittee or
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
our committee um you know maybe have a
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
combined letter to Dees to say hey you
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
should really extend this time or
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
whatever um What would I'm just asking
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
your opinion or should we wait I mean or
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
we could do both they might not respond
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
who knows um or change it or should we
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
wait until if there is a lot of people
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
there and feedback that we wait for it
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
to be you know extended what would your
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
what would your advice be to us about
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
that personally I think I would
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
recommend both because if you do the
 
00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
letter and they don't respond and then
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
there are 10 or 15 people that don't get
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
H at the public hearing then the uh jel
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
car is going to take that much more
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
seriously because they had been informed
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
that that might be a problem let's do
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
that yeah perfect thank you so much for
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
great yes sir thank you representative
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
Jama so and I'm thinking about you know
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
how we might want to change the these
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
processes going down the road as my
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
colleague has some legislation in good
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
legislation to do that so under the
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
current kind of the way things currently
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
work so the the the legislature can pass
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
legislation have it vetoed by the
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
governor and then when it comes to the
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
rule writing process we can provide
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
input to an agency and the agency's
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
response to us can be well we listened
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
to you but we didn't incorporate
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
anything that you told us yeah um and in
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
the end the legislature ends up
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
essentially powerless correct because we
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
tried to change the
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
law we're required effectively in this
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
situation to a super majority to pass
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
any law because it has to be veto proof
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
so we tried to change the law we
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't and then we give feedback to an
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
agency and the agency says
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
effectively thanks but no thanks y
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
um so my qu do I have that right I mean
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
it it feels like the legislature is
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
pretty powerless uh when it comes to
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually affecting the rule writing
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
process in a substantive way that's true
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
but uh my experience has been that
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh agencies executive agencies ignore
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature to their own
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
Peril I hope that's I hope that's thank
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
you very much I appreciate that I like
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna quote that no I'm just
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
kidding and there is a requirement uh
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
that the agency give uh due
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
consideration to public comment they are
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
not required to make changes because of
 
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.789 align:start position:0%
not required to make changes because of
that

00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
comment they should any other questions
