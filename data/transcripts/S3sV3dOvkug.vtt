00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
well welcome well thank you so much for
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
the second invitation
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
i am gonna plan on sharing um
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
some state and national trends and then
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
shift into a little bit of a deeper dive
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
into vaccines
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
and again focus on what this might mean
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
for the economy i anticipate that you're
 
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to have some questions
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
um some i will be able to answer and
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh some i may need to get out a crystal
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
ball for
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
um so i'd love to jump right into the
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
numbers i'm actually going to
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
turn off my video while i'm doing the
 
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.469 align:start position:0%
turn off my video while i'm doing the
slides

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
slides
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
simply uh for bandwidth issues i'm
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
coming to you live
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
from our public health covid operations
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
center which is not one of our regular
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
buildings and and the
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
internet is sometimes a little bit shaky
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to stop my video i'll pop
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
my video back on when we have time for
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
questions so great
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and i'm going to um
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
then jump right into the numbers here we
 
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.510 align:start position:0%
then jump right into the numbers here we
go

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i think in front of you you should
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
have a slide with a little bit of
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
national data
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
um although the cases have been trending
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
downward across the country
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
for some time um after our post holiday
 
00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.110 align:start position:0%
for some time um after our post holiday
spike

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
spike
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes it's not showing you haven't gone to
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
the next slide
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for letting me my
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
screen sharing has been paused
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
okay here if i can
 
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:32.930 align:start position:0%
slide two okay
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.230 align:start position:0%
slide two okay
[Music]

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
um let's see here i i
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
am not understanding why my screen
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
sharing is
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
paused so i'm going to stop
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
sharing i'm going to start over and see
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
if that will help
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
greg can you help her out
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
i would thank you about to suggest that
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
she stopped turning her screen and try
 
00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
she stopped turning her screen and try
again

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
um might be a good resume okay
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
no no no no
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
um for some reason the zoom is letting
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
me know that it's paused and it won't
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
let me
 
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.830 align:start position:0%
let me
share

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
so we're going to do this a third time
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
here try to see if that is the
 
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.949 align:start position:0%
here try to see if that is the
charm

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know what i will go ahead and just
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
let you know the data that we have
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
um and see if we can do it that way
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
um because i don't want to waste your
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
time today
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
so um we'll see if we can get those
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
slides in a little bit but i don't want
 
00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:48.710 align:start position:0%
slides in a little bit but i don't want
to

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
waste your um your really precious time
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
at this moment
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
so um here let me tell you a little bit
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
about the numbers
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
so our cases have been trending
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
downwards as you know um
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
and yesterday we passed really the
 
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.110 align:start position:0%
and yesterday we passed really the
solemn

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
solemn
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
mark of 500 000 american deaths
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
this is about a hundred thousand more
 
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.070 align:start position:0%
this is about a hundred thousand more
deaths

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
than when the last time that i've i came
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
to visit you that you invited me to
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
speak with you
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
and this number has actually impacted
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
our life expectancy
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
in the u.s it's reduced it by more than
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly 500 000 deaths is not the
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
worst case
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
projection that was considered a year
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
ago but
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think all of us would agree that it is
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
definitely too many lives
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
and it's heartbreaking for those of us
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
who have needlessly lost
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
our neighbors our friends and our family
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
cost and burden to our communities and
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
to our families
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
cannot be fully measured in dollars
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
or in this data alone as we look at the
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire data
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
you'll recognize and if i had my little
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
slide here you would see the giant
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
spike that many of us have been seeing
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
on tv and in the media
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
and that occurred between thanksgiving
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
20 and january 2021.
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
the good news in that as has been widely
 
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.630 align:start position:0%
the good news in that as has been widely
described

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
described
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
is that our active case count now is
 
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.670 align:start position:0%
is that our active case count now is
below

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
3 000 and our current hospitalizations
 
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:15.750 align:start position:0%
3 000 and our current hospitalizations
are

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
just above 100. this is remarkably
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
different than where we were
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
back in january where we had over 300
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
people in the hospital at the time
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
we were really pushing the limits of
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
some of our hospitals and some of our
 
00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.110 align:start position:0%
some of our hospitals and some of our
icus

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
icus
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
we never got to a critical moment but we
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
really were pushing the edges of it
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
and coming very close so while the
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
current numbers are still
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
too high we really are experiencing a
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
relief to our health care system now
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
most recently you can note that the high
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
rates of cases
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire are located in
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
stratford county
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
many of those are associated with the
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
university students that came back on
 
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.110 align:start position:0%
university students that came back on
campus

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
campus
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
um as i'll note later unh's
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
testing protocol has helped identify
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
those cases quickly and investigations
 
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
those cases quickly and investigations
have

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
indicated that those cases likely didn't
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
come from formal class settings
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
but rather informal gatherings if
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
you understand you'll see that we also
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
had higher rates in grafton county
 
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
had higher rates in grafton county
recently

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
again similarly many of these have been
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
associated with the college
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
while the college cases are starting to
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
go down now again
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
great news um they have gone um and this
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
mainly because um some of those
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
universities unh
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
plymouth have gone back to some remote
 
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.990 align:start position:0%
plymouth have gone back to some remote
learning

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
um we could note that about even
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday about 15
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
of our daily case count was associated
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
with a college or a university
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
another thing for just important for us
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
to think about as you think about the
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
current economy and the workforce
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
individuals ages
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
20 to 29 have both the highest
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
cumulative number of cases of cobin 19
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
and the highest rate and that's compared
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
to other
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
age cohorts it's important to note that
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
these cases are
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
found among all working age adults
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
these are folks that work in our
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
industries and in our businesses and
 
00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
industries and in our businesses and
then

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
go home to their families the good news
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
is that the lowest rates are among the
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
younger children
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
in addition to colleges we continue to
 
00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:25.509 align:start position:0%
in addition to colleges we continue to
identify

00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
small clusters in workplaces workplaces
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
such as manufacturing
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants and retail continue to have
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
small outbreaks some of the other good
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
news and certainly that we've all
 
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.629 align:start position:0%
news and certainly that we've all
recognized

00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
is the trend line among cases in
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
that we have the same pattern there if
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
again if i had my slides up you would
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
see the fancy graph where we would go
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
we spiked up in december and then
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
started to come down in january
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
the downward slide however for long-term
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
care facilities is even a little bit
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
more impressive
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
than the general public and this is
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
likely due to the vaccine efforts that
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
began in december
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
within those long-term care facilities
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
with our partners
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
in both cvs and walgreens that work
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
directly with those long-term care
 
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.389 align:start position:0%
directly with those long-term care
facilities

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
so that they have um the residents of
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
long-term care have received both doses
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
right now certainly if you had been a
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
resident as of december or january you
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
received both doses
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
and we're working on the continuation as
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
new residents come in
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
and staff turnover making sure that
 
00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:35.750 align:start position:0%
and staff turnover making sure that
those

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
facilities have access to as much
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine as they need
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
we are all very relieved to see that
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
these numbers have
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
started to go down among the most
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
vulnerable new hampshire residents
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
who really were most at risk for the
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
worst outcomes
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
of coved 19. so while we're feeling
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
cautiously optimistic about the downward
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
trends and daily counts again our number
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know our accounts are going down we
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
have 200 some odd cases today we were
 
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.670 align:start position:0%
have 200 some odd cases today we were
routinely

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of weeks ago we were in
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
the three and four hundreds and even
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
weeks before that
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
we were at 600 700 800 cases a day
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
so those numbers are starting to come
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
down nicely
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
and we are very excited by the
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
reductions in both hospitalization the
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
census in the hospital
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
as well as deaths of course we do
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
know that we are in our race a little
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
bit against
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
spread of those new variants we all know
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
that viruses constantly change over time
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
and through mutation
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
and variants of a virus are really
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
expected to occur sometimes these new
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
variants emerge
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
and disappear and sometimes the new
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
variants emerge
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
and persist right now we are focused on
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
three major variants b117
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
is known as the uk variant that i'm sure
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
you've been hearing about on the news
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
of the three variants this is the one
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
most prevalent in the u.s
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
right now with over 1600 documented
 
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.790 align:start position:0%
right now with over 1600 documented
cases

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
in over 44 states including new
 
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.949 align:start position:0%
in over 44 states including new
hampshire

00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire resident who was
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
infected with this variant
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
was an adult resident of hillsborough
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
county and they had had close
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
contact with someone who was diagnosed
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
with covid19
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
who had been traveling internationally
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
contact tracing was identified and close
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
household contacts were
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
were also identified but no community
 
00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:38.949 align:start position:0%
were also identified but no community
exposures

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
exposures
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
were identified all of the public health
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
measures of isolation quarantine testing
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
were followed including the testing of
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
all of the close whole
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
household context and so it's not
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
believed that there was a risk
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
to the community from this particular
 
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
to the community from this particular
case

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
quick testing and following those
 
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.910 align:start position:0%
quick testing and following those
protocols

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
helped contain the spread in south
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
africa there's another variant
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
called the b1351 and it emerged
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
independently of the uk variant the b117
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
um it was identified back in october
 
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.949 align:start position:0%
um it was identified back in october
2020

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
in south africa we have 22
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
cases in the u.s right now in 10 states
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
um since early january and finally
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
there's a p1
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
variant which is the third variant and
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
that one's known as the brazil variant
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
because it was found
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
in travelers who were traveling from
 
00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:38.550 align:start position:0%
in travelers who were traveling from
brazil

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
brazil
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
back in early january only five cases
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
of have been identified in the u.s so
 
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.949 align:start position:0%
of have been identified in the u.s so
far

00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
it appears that these variants seem to
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
spread more easily and
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
some data is suggesting that the
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
symptoms may be worse
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
especially among unvaccinated
 
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
especially among unvaccinated
individuals

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
data especially from the uk where the
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
uk variant is widely spreading
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
is suggesting that the current vaccines
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
the pfizer and the moderna
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
are effective in reducing death
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
and severe disease and hospitalization
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
among those with a uk variant so they
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
may get it
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
but the symptoms are less and really the
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
things that we're most concerned about
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
which is hospitalization and death
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
do not seem to occur if people have been
 
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.909 align:start position:0%
do not seem to occur if people have been
vaccinated

00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
with the current pfizer and moderna
 
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.870 align:start position:0%
with the current pfizer and moderna
vaccines

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
so while all this data on uh cases is
 
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.110 align:start position:0%
so while all this data on uh cases is
important

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
and those variants are important to keep
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
in the back of your mind i think one of
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
the things that you're most con
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
interested in is an update on the
 
00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
interested in is an update on the
vaccines

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
as we all know we have been rolling out
 
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.789 align:start position:0%
as we all know we have been rolling out
vaccine

00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
distribution since late december and we
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
have hit
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
some bumps in the road which again have
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
been widely publicized
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
we have been actively trying to address
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
those issues as they come along
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
and keep readjusting we have more than 4
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
000 people a day
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
coming through our vaccine sites all
 
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.830 align:start position:0%
coming through our vaccine sites all
across

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
the state we redeployed state workers to
 
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.350 align:start position:0%
the state we redeployed state workers to
answer

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
phones we've taken over empty mall space
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
where i am right now and parking lots we
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
have specialized
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
teams on meeting the needs of homebound
 
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.710 align:start position:0%
teams on meeting the needs of homebound
patients

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
on individuals who have been
 
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
on individuals who have been
disproportionately

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionately
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
affected by covet we have a number of
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
really focused teams trying to get
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
to those folks that might be most at
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
risk of not being able to access
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine and i i simply want to note that
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
we could not do this work
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
without the national guard our health
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
care providers
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
and our community partners we cannot
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
extend enough gratitude
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
in their direction they have all been
 
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.270 align:start position:0%
in their direction they have all been
extraordinary

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
in helping us with the rollout that we
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
have today
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
we are still in phase 1b and we have
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
some work to go
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
in phase 1b but as
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
march draws nearer we have our eyes and
 
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.710 align:start position:0%
march draws nearer we have our eyes and
our

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
planning hats all focused on the next
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
phase which is phase
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
two which will include those teachers
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
and child care workers
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
as well as individuals between 50
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
and age 64. so again 1b
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
we know that's the 65 and older group
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
and it's those folks that have multiple
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
comorbidities and that's who's rolling
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
through our vaccine sites right now
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
as appointments and vaccine become
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
available we call people up on the phone
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
and we get them in in line
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
we've administered about 74
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
of the 324 324
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
000 doses that we have received as of
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
last thursday
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
12 of new hampshire's population has
 
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
received one dose
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
and about five percent of the population
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
has received
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
both of their doses and are now fully
 
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.149 align:start position:0%
both of their doses and are now fully
vaccinated

00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
each day thousands more people are
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
receiving that vaccine and state
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 37
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
of those eligible in phase 1a and phase
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
1b which is
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
um you know the total number in those
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
groups is about 438 000 people
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
has gotten one dose so about 37 of that
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
438 000 people
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
have gotten one dose there have been
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
a number of questions um about
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
the what percentage of adults must be
 
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
the what percentage of adults must be
vaccinated

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
in order to receive you know get to some
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
herd immunity many epi models
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
and experts like dr fauci have suggested
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
that it's something
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
close to herd immunity occurs around 75
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
of individuals vaccinated but even with
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
these experts in the mathematical
 
00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:03.190 align:start position:0%
these experts in the mathematical
modeling

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
modeling
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
we unfortunately can't predict exactly
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
what vaccination rate will be needed to
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
return to sort of
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
some sense of normal there are just
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
too many questions about the coronavirus
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
that we simply
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
cannot answer right now and those
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions are things like
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
people who are vaccinated could still
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
pose some small risk of
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
spreading the virus even though the
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines protect them from serious
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
illness and hospitalization and death
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
they still may be able to spread we need
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
to see the real world examples of what
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
that might look like
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
not just the mathematical modeling and
 
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.830 align:start position:0%
not just the mathematical modeling and
because

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
no vaccine is a 100 effective um
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
some vaccinated people may still get ill
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
and could again
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
could still pass on the disease and then
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
of course that we have the variance
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
so we have all of these things that are
 
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
so we have all of these things that are
making

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know that prognostication difficult
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
right now our governor stated last week
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
at his press conference
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
um that he actually didn't fully expect
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
that we would get to 75 percent of the
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
population vaccinated and that we
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
probably should always expect to have
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
some level of covet
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
within the community but the good news
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
is that with enough
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
people taking that vaccine we will see
 
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.029 align:start position:0%
people taking that vaccine we will see
other

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
data points move we will see those daily
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
case counts go down
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
we will see the number of people in the
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
hospital go down
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
and the number of deaths go down and
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
those are all
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
equally important to the magic
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
percentage that
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
of people vaccinating vaccinated
 
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.789 align:start position:0%
of people vaccinating vaccinated
reopening

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
reopening
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
will not necessarily be tied to just
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
one data point as all of these numbers
 
00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:48.230 align:start position:0%
one data point as all of these numbers
go

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
down and vaccinations go up it's clear
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
that we are protecting the most
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
at risk and we will begin to see more
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility in how we can live work
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
and play vaccine is one of the most
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
important tools we'll have in the
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
toolbox but it is
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
not the only tool uh for the time being
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
we will still need to test
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
like crazy i think we saw that in the
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
past few weeks at unh and plymouth how
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
important that testing strategy really
 
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.549 align:start position:0%
important that testing strategy really
is

00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
um and it helps us identify where we
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
have pockets and where we need to really
 
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
have pockets and where we need to really
focus

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
focus
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
additional effort the testing allows us
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
to isolate
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
and quarantine folks to further prevent
 
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
and quarantine folks to further prevent
spread

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
spread
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
we are currently testing somewhere over
 
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
we are currently testing somewhere over
8

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
8
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
000 people a day in a variety of
 
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.029 align:start position:0%
000 people a day in a variety of
settings

00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
settings
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
so our eyes really need to be on several
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
metrics that we needed there
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
where eyes need to be on back deep new
 
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.029 align:start position:0%
where eyes need to be on back deep new
cases

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and deaths and so while
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
some of us have our eyes on that data
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's also clear that folks like our
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
governor's reopening task force
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
have their uh and and also many
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
businesses have their eyes
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
on the summer um guidance will soon be
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
released for things like summer camp
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
which is pretty exciting for kids and
 
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.269 align:start position:0%
which is pretty exciting for kids and
families

00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
so that our kids can get back outside
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
and parents can have the child here that
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
they need and i think that
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
as this committee you understand the
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
child care that that families really
 
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.549 align:start position:0%
child care that that families really
need

00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
other guidance will start coming out of
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
that task force soon and with the
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
governor's off the governor's blessing
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
around um helping restaurants and
 
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.390 align:start position:0%
around um helping restaurants and
lodging

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
lodging
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know again continue to evolve and be
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
able to serve their
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
their public and their clients and their
 
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.630 align:start position:0%
their public and their clients and their
customers

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
customers
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
and as more and more vaccines we have
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
more and more vaccine we anticipate that
 
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.750 align:start position:0%
more and more vaccine we anticipate that
people

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
will be able to travel a little bit more
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
broadly to the beach or to the mountains
 
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
broadly to the beach or to the mountains
or

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
to our main streets which i know is what
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
are concerned about the vaccines begin
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
to give us
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit of freedom to do the many
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the things that we really
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
want to do and we have been missing
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
outdoor activities this summer are still
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
going to be the safest
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
but that's probably what we do best in
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
even our performing arts venues are
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
beginning to be incredibly
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
creative to be able to produce the kind
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
of events
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
that are safe for both their performers
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
and their staff and the public go for
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
funds and other supports have enabled
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
businesses to adjust
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
and stay on track and really be able to
 
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:29.909 align:start position:0%
and stay on track and really be able to
meet

00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they need to do
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
with this guidance things like focus on
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
their ventilation systems
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
focusing on changing some of the ways in
 
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.029 align:start position:0%
focusing on changing some of the ways in
which

00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
they also do their business we've
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
learned that things like child
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
care infrastructure is critically
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
important if we want businesses and
 
00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
important if we want businesses and
people

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to work i think
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
as we plan for phase two again for child
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
care workers and teachers
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and people 50 to 64.
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
one of the main things that we have to
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
do within the department and with our
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
partners is short up that registration
 
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.269 align:start position:0%
partners is short up that registration
system

00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
again we've all known the hiccups that
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
we've occurred we've had to work with a
 
00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:13.590 align:start position:0%
we've occurred we've had to work with a
clunky

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
clunky
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
federal system we've had a sort of build
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
our system at the same time
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
and make those systems talk together um
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
and there certainly have been hiccups
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
along the way and so when we're thinking
 
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.029 align:start position:0%
along the way and so when we're thinking
about

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
getting ready for phase two we want that
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
to go even more
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
smoothly and so we're putting in the
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
effort around the clock right now
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
getting ready for that the feds have
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
also indicated that
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
additional vaccines will be on the way
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
johnson and johnson vaccine should be
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
available soon you'll recall that's the
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
one doser
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
it has a little slightly less efficacy
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
than the pfizer and the moderna that we
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
have now but experts are really telling
 
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.070 align:start position:0%
have now but experts are really telling
us

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
um that it's first of all any vaccine is
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
better than no vaccine
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
and what's most important about all of
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
these vaccines
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
is the ability to reduce severe illness
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and keep us out of the hospital
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
and keep us from dying and johnson and
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
johnson does that well
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
as well but it requires us to be
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
thinking about different ways
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
that we do the logistics around
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
getting that those doses out once they
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
come here
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
we are currently considering ways to
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
increase the throughput at our vaccine
 
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.470 align:start position:0%
increase the throughput at our vaccine
centers

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
especially as we wrap up the efforts for
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
some of the most vulnerable people that
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
are in phase 1a and phase 1b
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
we are looking at additional ideas of
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps doing some indoor
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
centers we are starting right now this
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
week up in
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
lebanon using an old jc penney's that
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
has been closed we will be starting
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
there doing indoor
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination we think that that will
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
improve the throughput we'll be able to
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
get people
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
faster through those um indoor sites and
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
especially again as we get to phase two
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
and we have a broader section of
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
population we think that that's probably
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
the best way to go
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
that'll be both safe and effective in
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
getting the numbers through that we
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
would like to get through
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
especially if we get more doses from the
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
feds soon
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we're busy scoping out empty retail
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
sites across the state
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
empty parking lots and others so that we
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
can get things set up ready to go
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
you know again i want to say that the
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
logistical support of the national guard
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
has been critical to our success when
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
you get your vaccine as i hope many of
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
you already have or
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
or you're planning to please be sure to
 
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.110 align:start position:0%
or you're planning to please be sure to
thank

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
them and the volunteers and the first
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
responders who
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
have been helping get things rolling out
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
and get those shots
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
into arms so i'll wrap up with just a
 
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.549 align:start position:0%
into arms so i'll wrap up with just a
reminder

00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
reminder
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
that if folks have questions if your
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
constituents have questions
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
to call 2-1-1 we know that there are
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes long waits
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
and we're sometimes put on hold for a
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
little while but those folks are working
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
um crazy hours right now to get in touch
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
with everybody that they need to get in
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
touch with
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
um we're pulling people up earlier that
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
had later appointments we're trying to
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
get them into earlier appointments
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're working with places like
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
ammunition community health center up in
 
00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:14.389 align:start position:0%
ammunition community health center up in
littleton

00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
littleton
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
who just found out from the feds that
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
they'll be receiving some
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
some vaccine we've been working with
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
walgreens who has
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
also received some vaccine and so we're
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
really working in a coordinated way
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
to get as many people through as quickly
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
so we can all have our eyes on what we
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
hope will be a summer
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
um that we can get outside and we can
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
get back to doing some of the things
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we all love to do so um
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
again i will wrap up there i thank the
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee for asking us to come and do
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
this update
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
um you may have some additional
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
questions for me
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you patricia uh
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
your slides even though we didn't get to
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
see them you
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
send yes i'll send them a lot i'll email
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
them along
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh questions for
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
the deputy started with representative
 
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
the deputy started with representative
bromley

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
bromley
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
followed by representative elni thank
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
you patricia good good presentation
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh so we're currently at 4 000 a day is
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
yeah between 4 thousand and five
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
thousand a day depending on the day
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
so you know uh like right after we had a
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
snow day
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
our numbers bumped way up um you know
 
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:30.630 align:start position:0%
our numbers bumped way up um you know
but

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere in in that ballpark so
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
what's the goal now though
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
you said that we're going to try to gear
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
up so that we can do more than four
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
what would that goal be to be more than
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
4 000 a day
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes so wha what kind of a goal are we
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
um so um i don't have that number right
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
in front of me
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
right now i mean what we want to do is
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
get move
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
out as much of the vaccine that we get
 
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.310 align:start position:0%
out as much of the vaccine that we get
in

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
every day so we are dependent on what
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
the supply chain is coming in from the
 
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.549 align:start position:0%
the supply chain is coming in from the
feds

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
feds
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
um i think the numbers you know knowing
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
um some promises for increased vaccine
 
00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:08.870 align:start position:0%
um some promises for increased vaccine
coming

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
soon um the idea is to get to those
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
other kind of sites where we can improve
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
that daily throughput
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
and um i don't have that number you know
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
the exact goal for you right now but
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
um we know that we have large numbers of
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
people in
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
phase two that we need to move through
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
and so that the current rate that we're
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
going right now
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
is insufficient but again it is limited
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
by the number of vaccine we actually
 
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.710 align:start position:0%
by the number of vaccine we actually
have

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative followed
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
by representatives
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
1b is reserving spots
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
in may at this point on
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
i know because i spent a long time on
 
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.830 align:start position:0%
i know because i spent a long time on
2-1-1

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
2-1-1
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
and then got a very nice national guard
 
00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.350 align:start position:0%
and then got a very nice national guard
person

00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
who told me that on told me that
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
and told me that there was absolutely no
 
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.669 align:start position:0%
and told me that there was absolutely no
way

00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
that anybody who was more severely at
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
risk than the general over 65 population
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
could indicate that anywhere so that
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
they could be called
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
earlier this is an answer i've been
 
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:19.990 align:start position:0%
earlier this is an answer i've been
getting

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere i've tried and there seems to
 
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:23.750 align:start position:0%
everywhere i've tried and there seems to
be

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
informal systems going on
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
to allow on people to sign
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
sign up on local lists and
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
somebody local would then be able to
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
call you when there was left over a
 
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.789 align:start position:0%
call you when there was left over a
vaccine

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
those lists are accompanied by people
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
saying oh we shouldn't be
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
my hospital because vams doesn't
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
like it is um refuses to participate in
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
on i do not understand
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
are we going to wait till after may to
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
start going to two
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
or are that is two going to start coming
 
00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:11.029 align:start position:0%
or are that is two going to start coming
in

00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the middle of 665 and older
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
on and keep people who really
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
need it uh from
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
being able to get it because they got
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
signed up for me and uh
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it's i'm i'm in lebanon
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's great news about jcpenney but we
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
nobody here seems to know anything about
 
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.190 align:start position:0%
nobody here seems to know anything about
that

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
or how you would get on
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
get people who need to be gotten except
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
for we do know
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
under 65 works better and that must be
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
because you're using the state system
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
rather than the vam system but the van
 
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:02.710 align:start position:0%
rather than the vam system but the van
system

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
is really getting in the way of the
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
people that need it most
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
so you have a whole series of questions
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
there you should
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
probably answer they were all
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
connected to each other and are the
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
result of two months of real frustration
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
and um thank you for sharing that and we
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
distinctly aware of the incredible
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
frustration that the public is feeling
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
right now especially
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
among populations 65 and older trying to
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
get their vaccine and trying to
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know get those appointments moved up
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
we are actively every day
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
taking people off the bottom of that you
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
know the way bottom of that list
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
the folks that have appointments in
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
april um the folks that
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
may have an appointment in may reaching
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
out to them and trying to put them back
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
up at the top of the list as new
 
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:02.150 align:start position:0%
up at the top of the list as new
appointments

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
open um so you know the uh
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
switch from the art lebanon armory over
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
to the pennies
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
site um and i i live in the upper valley
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
as well so i know that
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh area quite well it's a it's a great
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
location we're really happy to be able
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
to have it
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
um is really in preparation
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
again for the time at which we are going
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
to have more vaccine and more
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
appointments available we are committed
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
to getting through this one
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
b group to the best degree possible
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
before we take on more
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh folks so and we are also committed to
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
shoring up those systems those
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
those database systems so that people
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
can have a better experience in
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
scheduling their appointments and
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
getting those appointments ready
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the time that you spent
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
on 2-1-1 we know we have
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
100 literally hundreds of national guard
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
and state staff right now answering
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
those phones
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
um and again we know the lines are the
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
the weight can be long sometimes but
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
they're um they're very friendly and
 
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:03.670 align:start position:0%
they're um they're very friendly and
very

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
um helpful once you once you get a hold
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
um as we know we can't fully um we have
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
with the vam system it's the cdc system
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's what's tied
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know we have to tie into that to
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
some degree
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a magic answer for you
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
right now other than we are
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
dedicated every day we've got folks
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
making phone calls one after another to
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
try and move people up into earlier
 
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
try and move people up into earlier
spots

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
spots
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
we were able to move a bunch of people
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know a couple thousand people
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
from those later slots into getting um
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
shots at walgreens because walgreens has
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
gotten a federal contract
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
to have some doses so we were one of the
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
only states that have worked and working
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
hand in hand with our pharmacy partner
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to take care of the people
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
who were at the end of the list
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
and get them moved up towards the
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
beginning so those are the sort of
 
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.950 align:start position:0%
beginning so those are the sort of
strategies

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
that we're putting in place the other
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
note the thing that you noted about
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
people having informal lists
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
um it's uh you know i know that there's
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
been some
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
confusion in the communities because our
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
major effort has really been the state
 
00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
major effort has really been the state
fixed

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
sites but we also have our public health
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
networks in each of our regions around
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
who are working within communities to
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
try and get
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
at some organism to places where people
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
might have
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
not have as much access so there are
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
some different ways
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
people are getting vaccinated so they
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
may those public health networks might
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
be working with a senior center
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
um or maybe working in other communities
 
00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
um or maybe working in other communities
instead

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
in other um working with a church there
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
so those folks have have also been
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine out um the best that they can
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
but that's certainly not the
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
overwhelming number of vaccines that are
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
going out right now
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
so all i can say right now is that it
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
has been imperfect
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
we are working on it 24 7 to try and
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
more perfect um and really dedicated to
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
getting people
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
off that bottom of that list and getting
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
a vaccine sooner
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative early followed
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
by representative elliot
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i have uh three questions one
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know what your definition of
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
a case is
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
when um i was undergoing paramedic
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
training there was a very
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
specific definition that doesn't seem to
 
00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
specific definition that doesn't seem to
be

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
the case now the second question
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
is um regarding the uk variant that has
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
been discovered
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
the way the press portrayed it was that
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
rampant found in new hampshire oh my god
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
kill all you know that kind of stuff
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
but i didn't hear anything from your
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
office saint no
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
as you gave a very nice uh presentation
 
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:50.870 align:start position:0%
as you gave a very nice uh presentation
here

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
these people followed protocol and
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's not believed to be any community
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
exposure um
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard that publicly
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's not being done by your
 
00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:04.710 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's not being done by your
office

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
more likely wmur doesn't see a headline
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i haven't heard anything yet about a
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
reaction rate
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
to any of the uh vaccines that have been
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
offered thus far
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
although nationwide and worldwide
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
um as much as a 10
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
serious reaction rate um have you
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
noticed any of that in new hampshire
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for my questions great thanks
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
so you've got three
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
questions right there i'll start with
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
the case numbers so
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
we use this commonly among our
 
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.710 align:start position:0%
we use this commonly among our
epidemiology

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
epidemiology
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
groups and and with cdc um to
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
you describe people we count as having a
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
particular condition so in this case
 
00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:53.349 align:start position:0%
particular condition so in this case
coven

00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
coven
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
we follow the national case definition
 
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:56.790 align:start position:0%
we follow the national case definition
um

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
for this the covet 19 infection um
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
and that is set by cdc so they create
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
and we use that as we um
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
that's what meets our case definition um
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
there are other uh diseases and
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
conditions that get counted
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
similarly in this ways like salmonella
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
or tuberculosis
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
so it really is it's our count but what
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
gets defined as the case you know
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
um has a is a little bit more of a
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
complex process of
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
um you know meeting the particular
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
laboratory standards
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
or other presumed standards so i'm i'd
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
be happy to
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
i don't i was just trying to pull that
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
up and again i'm not i can't
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
do 50 things at once right now but i'd
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
be happy to send you the case definition
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
from cdc when i'm done
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
off here of what it of um who gets
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
counted in that
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
but we're really just using cases that
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
the case definition is just our count
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
um personal identification i would
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
definition being sent out thank you yeah
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely and
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
i'm it's hard for me to do two or three
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
things at the same time right now
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
um so um i'm gonna follow up on your
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
and your second question was um and i
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
just lost my train of thought again
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
because i was trying to google while i
 
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:12.550 align:start position:0%
because i was trying to google while i
was

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
was talking could you just remind me
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
again your second question
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
i apologize for that but thank you very
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah the uk variant so if you look to
 
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.829 align:start position:0%
yeah the uk variant so if you look to
our

00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
um press release that we put out when it
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
happened it actually
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
did have some of that information in
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
there that there was really no
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
um we there was no cause for community
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
exposure or cause for concern about
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
community exposure because in this case
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
people did the right thing they were
 
00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:42.790 align:start position:0%
people did the right thing they were
sick

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
sick
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
they got tested um it was no there was a
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
as part of that investigation they noted
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
that the person that they
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
had had close contact with had had
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
international travel
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
um that also was part of what allowed us
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
to do the detail
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
of genomic surveillance on the test um
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
and to identify that it was the uk
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
variant so again
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
um you know this is relatively good news
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
we knew eventually we were going to
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
see one of these variants for a number
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
of weeks
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
there were cases identified in
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts new york
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
um vermont even had one i i believe
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
um you know so we were surrounded by it
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
so it was only time that we would
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
we would find that case um so i agree
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
um you know there was not a significant
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
cause for alarm
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's important to know
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's an important piece of information
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
for everybody to have
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
in just their awareness about why things
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
like wearing masks is still
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
important social distancing is important
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
as well as vaccine and your third
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
question again if you could just remind
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that was the reaction rate oh the
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
reaction rate so the reaction rate is
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
um uh we don't have new hampshire
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
specific data at this point so what will
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
happen and many of you who've had your
 
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
happen and many of you who've had your
vaccine

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
might know this um you sign in
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
you're invited to sign up to something
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
called theirs which is the
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse event reporting system
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
through cdc
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
um i was fortunate enough to have my own
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine so you type in what your
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
how you're feeling every day and what
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
your reactions are
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
um i can say that we have not had any
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
significant events
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
at our testing sites of sort of
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
immediate anaphylaxis
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
events we have had some people that
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
we've watched and we've monitored and
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
we've connected them with their
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
but we are we don't have new hampshire
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
specific data yet
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
around what the adverse events might be
 
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:40.710 align:start position:0%
around what the adverse events might be
here

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the data that you were
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting around 10
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
um you know is is perhaps in the
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
ballpark and it also defines what you
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
know depends what you mean by
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
an adverse event whether it's a
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
life-threatening adverse event
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
or the sort of reaction that we all
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
expect especially
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
after that second dose the second dose
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
punches a wallop
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
um as the media has told you and perhaps
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
your friends and family have experienced
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
um you know some percentage of people
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
will end up with a fever
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
um with soreness with swollen lymph
 
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:12.710 align:start position:0%
um with soreness with swollen lymph
nodes

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
nodes
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
with you know fatigue um it's been our
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
experience that usually clears up within
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
a day or so
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
um you know one to three days and that
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know it goes away
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
i will personally share i also got sort
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
of got a wallop
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
on my second dose um and it was 20 hours
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
of feeling pretty punky
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
um and then i woke up and i was fine um
 
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.109 align:start position:0%
um and then i woke up and i was fine um
so

00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
um you know for many folks that's a
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
small price to pay for
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
um the benefit of vaccination so thank
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
you and thanks for
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
repeating the questions for me no
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
problem thank you mr chair
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative elliott followed by
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative murphy represent ellie
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
you need to unmute
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
represent elliott unmute yourself okay
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
i did it thank you uh for taking my
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
question madam director
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
and uh i got my appointment
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
because we state reps have a lot of pull
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
i got my appointment last week
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it's for april 24th
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
which by my way of counting is two
 
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.190 align:start position:0%
which by my way of counting is two
months

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
so with all of the pull that we have
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
would you say that that's the normal
 
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.589 align:start position:0%
would you say that that's the normal
time

00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
for people without pull to
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
get an appointment two months is that
 
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.349 align:start position:0%
get an appointment two months is that
correct

00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
do you have any statistics on that yeah
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
um we are seeing um
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
people you know uh there's no magic way
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
to get a vaccine
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
um unlike to be honest other states that
 
00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:44.550 align:start position:0%
um unlike to be honest other states that
have

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know counties and cities all doing
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
different things we have
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know for good or bad new hampshire
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
has a much more centralized approach
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
what we are um it is not you know
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
unusual for someone
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
to get an appointment date that that is
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
that far out
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
um but what as i noted to representative
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
almi a little bit earlier what we're
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
doing is trying to pull people off the
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
back of that list
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
um as we have appointments pop open
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
earlier or as especially if we have new
 
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.190 align:start position:0%
earlier or as especially if we have new
vaccine

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
additional vaccine we are trying to pull
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
people off that later
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
list and get them settled into an
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
earlier appoint time every day i hear
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
people say yep the national guard folks
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
gave me a call
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
so i really encourage everyone who gets
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
a phone call
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
on on their smartphone and it says new
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire health department
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
pick up the phone um because it usually
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
means you've got some good news
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
um that they are trying to reschedule
 
00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:40.950 align:start position:0%
um that they are trying to reschedule
you

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
so um hold tight you um one of the
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
things you can always do
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
is try and call 2-1-1 as well it's as i
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
said it's a it's a
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
really quite frankly almost unacceptable
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
wait time sometimes to get
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
through but if you have the time to sit
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
um sometimes
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
they can be able to help you um with
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
those appointments and see if there's
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me for interrupting but are you
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
saying that yes
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
the normal waiting time is two months
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
i say i'm saying that that has not been
 
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.829 align:start position:0%
i say i'm saying that that has not been
unusual

00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
so we have had people when people signed
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
up in january we
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
can test the next week
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
if it's not unusual than
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's usual so the answer is yes
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
is that correct it is correct that
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
some people have had to wait that long
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
it is also correct that some people have
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
not represented
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
earlier she's answered your question
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative murphy followed by
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative nunes
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
patricia my question is
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
more to do with the new state system
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
as representative almi mentioned the
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
frustration that
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
i have experienced but i think many of
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
my neighbors and friends have
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
experienced is that
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's a significant disconnect between
 
00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.309 align:start position:0%
there's a significant disconnect between
2-1-1

00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
2-1-1
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
and those folks are great they're very
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
nice the wait time has not been that
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
problematic if you call later in the day
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
and they're very nice but they're not
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
helpful in the sense that if
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
you have to change it or it is canceled
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
they will suggest you go back into vans
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
and you could
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
lose an appointment and then go into
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
outer space into may june or july
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that's not going to be acceptable my
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
question is regarding the
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
new state system number one when is it
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
coming on board
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
will there be a voice a real person that
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
you can talk to
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
who can actually make an appointment and
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
schedule an appointment for you
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
including the follow-up appointment if
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
need be
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
because so many people like at dh in and
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
out down in boston i know because my
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
daughter got it
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
will they be able to after you get the
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
first injection
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
give you that on the spot a follow-up
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
appointment so my questions really
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
surround the new system coming
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
on board when and how uh effective
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
and user-friendly will it be so
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
we are um developing it as we speak we
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
do not have a go live date right now
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
because i think we've all learned that
 
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.190 align:start position:0%
because i think we've all learned that
uh

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
and and it's just good business sense
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
not to launch something until it's ready
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a date for it to to go
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
live we know that we need to have it
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
ready for
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
um for phase two um i'm gonna circle
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
back and answer one of your other
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
questions around second appointments
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has been
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
happening now for the past couple of
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
weeks is that you get your second
 
00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:36.470 align:start position:0%
weeks is that you get your second
appointment

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
um as you receive your first dose so
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
you're given that appointment right away
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
so that you get
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
within that four week window so we have
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
solved we've done some back-end changing
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
and been able to solve that
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
problem that people were having earlier
 
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.270 align:start position:0%
problem that people were having earlier
on

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um in late january and the beginning of
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
february where
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
they would have to go out and get back
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
on vans and the second appointment was
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know two months away instead of the
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
recommended three or four weeks
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
so we have solved that problem sort of
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
check mark that and we will continue
 
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:07.829 align:start position:0%
check mark that and we will continue
that

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
as we move forward um with the new
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
system so that second appointments or
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
an issue um one of the you know you've
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
highlighted one of the features of the
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
van system that we have not been able to
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
get around which is the i have to cancel
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
my appointment to see a new appointment
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly a piece of
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
functionality that we're trying to work
 
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:29.750 align:start position:0%
functionality that we're trying to work
on

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
the logistics um we have folks from
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
deloitte working with us
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
and others um so that we're ready to go
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
and be able to be more have more
 
00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.309 align:start position:0%
and be able to be more have more
flexibility

00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
um for when we start enrolling
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
the larger groups that are coming in in
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
phase two
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
um and also so that we can help the rest
 
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:47.829 align:start position:0%
um and also so that we can help the rest
of

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
um phase 1b get their vaccine so
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have a go live day we're working
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
on it right now it needs to be done
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
before we go to phase two
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
um and um the follow-up appointments are
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
taken care of right now
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
manually um the minute you get your
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
first notes
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up if i may oh um
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
i personally got my appointment you know
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
but as soon as i found out on the 20th
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
of january or whenever it was i got it
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
four weeks ago
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
i went home that afternoon i tried to
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
make an appointment i got it in
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
claremont the earliest would be tomorrow
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
that was well before we knew we had the
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
sessions going on so
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's just difficult to
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
rearrange through the vm system so
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
the sprinter that comes up and running
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
the better it's going to be for people
 
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.150 align:start position:0%
the better it's going to be for people
logistically

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
logistically
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we we agree 100
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
that it's been a challenge um it's just
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
been a challenge so thank you
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that and good luck on your
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
your vaccine tomorrow you should get
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
your second dose appointment right then
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative is followed by
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you miss
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
tilly for being with ways and means this
 
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.950 align:start position:0%
tilly for being with ways and means this
morning

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you about
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
continued vaccinations
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
today johnson johnson goes before the
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
feds today
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh they'll be presenting to energy and
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
commerce about
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
licensing for their vaccine they have a
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
promise of being able to deliver 20
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
million vaccines
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is a more traditional type of
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine than what is being offered right
 
00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:22.230 align:start position:0%
vaccine than what is being offered right
now

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
and they also have a promise that they
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
would have another 100 million ready by
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
the end of june
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
now what i want to know from
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
from you today is is new hampshire uh
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
in the planning for receiving this more
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
traditional vaccine
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
in our state uh and if so how would that
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
be distributed and will our residents
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
have a choice of the type of vaccine
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
that they can that they can have will
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
they be able to request it
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
or are they going to be forced to take a
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
certain type of vaccine
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you yes those are great
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative nunes
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
um so yeah the answer to your question
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
is yes we are planning
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
um tremendously right now um trying to
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
get ready for what this will mean
 
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.750 align:start position:0%
get ready for what this will mean
logistically

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
logistically
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we have access to the johnson and
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
johnson vaccine and again
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
i think all of us know on this call um
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's a one-jabber not a two-jabber
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
um like pfizer and modernist so
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
logistically it makes things a little
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
bit easier
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
um and distribution can be um we can
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
think about that in a much more
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
broad sense as as we move forward we do
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
not have a number yet
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
um from the feds um of what our first
 
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.349 align:start position:0%
um from the feds um of what our first
doses

00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
doses
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
might actually be there's lots of
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
conjecture out there
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
the industry has given some numbers but
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
we do not have a number
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
yet from um our federal partners of what
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
that might look like
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
um you know it certainly is a firm
 
00:53:50.319 --> 00:53:50.710 align:start position:0%
um you know it certainly is a firm
number

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
of what those first allocations will be
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
to your question around um how are we
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
deciding and how are we planning we're
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
doing a couple of things we have
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
our folks that are doing the logistics
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
of that um within the department of what
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
that might look like
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
in our vaccine distribution
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
we've also been meeting with something
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
called the state disaster medical
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
advisory committee it's called the sd
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
mac because every govern government
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
agency loves an acronym so the
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
sd mac has been meeting in an emergency
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
meeting last week
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
to talk about johnson and johnson to
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
really start weighing some of the
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
ethical and logistical questions about
 
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.390 align:start position:0%
ethical and logistical questions about
who

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
gets these shots as i noted in my
 
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.670 align:start position:0%
gets these shots as i noted in my
presentation

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
the efficacy rate is a little bit less
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
in johnson and johnson um
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
you know experts are telling us that in
 
00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:41.910 align:start position:0%
you know experts are telling us that in
reality

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
um you know it's just as good as trump
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
as the uh spiezer moderner in terms of
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
this deer you know
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
you don't get seriously ill and you
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't get hospitalized and the risk of
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
death is very very low
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
but um it is you know the numbers are
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
what they
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
are there is a difference in terms of
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
just prevalence and case prevalence
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
um so that's entering into our um
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
conversations around
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
what types of groups of people would be
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
better suited for at johnson and johnson
 
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:10.789 align:start position:0%
better suited for at johnson and johnson
versus

00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
pfizer or germa and those are complex
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
decisions and i don't think we've
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
landed on a firm um
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
a firm plan moving forward um i think
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
logistically it would be sort of
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to drive through
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
your drive-through vaccine site and sort
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
an array of vaccine were put in front of
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
you and you know do you want the pfizer
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
do you want the maternity
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
do you want the johnson and johnson that
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
that becomes um
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
complicated in terms of you know knowing
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
appointments to schedule um and you know
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
what happens if you're first in line
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
that day versus
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
last decline that day when we're dealing
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
with such limited doses so you've
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
hit on all the right questions and
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i don't have
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
final answers for you because we are in
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
the midst of doing that work right now
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
follow it mr chairman okay uh
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you sir uh and miss tilly thank
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
you for those answers
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
i want to clarify down to a certain
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
point of
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh you just stated to us that that
 
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.789 align:start position:0%
uh you just stated to us that that
logistically

00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
logistically
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
and looking at demographics that that
 
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:15.990 align:start position:0%
and looking at demographics that that
you

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
guys would be working to make choices
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
about how those would be distributed
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
my question was about choice for the
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
resident yeah
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
will the resident be able to have choice
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
of the type of vaccine that they want
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's what we're we're working
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
on right now is figuring out what that
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
might look like and how you would
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
how you could possibly make that happen
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't have an answer of
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
yes no exactly how that would be done
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to figure that out
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
given the
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
small numbers we anticipate having um
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
how you could um again
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
logistically make those choices
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
available to folks
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
or what recommendations we would make
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
for people are there certain populations
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
we would recommend
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
one over the other um you know this is a
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than say our flu
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine right now where you talk with
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
your provider there's several different
 
00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:06.789 align:start position:0%
your provider there's several different
ways

00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
to get flu vaccine but there's enough
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
product out there
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
that you can choose them um and so you
 
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:13.510 align:start position:0%
that you can choose them um and so you
know

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
these those are some of the limiting
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
factors that we have in our planning
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
is how to manage um some of the
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate clinical choices that people
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
would have to make
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
um you know potentially with their
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
providers input
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
um or just their own of what their
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
preference is they're
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know say you're needle phobic and
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna get a vaccine if i gotta
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
do it twice but you know you can get me
 
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.430 align:start position:0%
do it twice but you know you can get me
once

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's what we're
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
working on right now these are
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
really the the tough questions um and
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
the tough planning that's going on
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
today thank you mr thank you miss tilly
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
represent tucker
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
followed by representative southwood
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for uh answering our
 
00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.270 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for uh answering our
questions

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
i never thought i had uh constituents
 
00:57:56.319 --> 00:57:56.950 align:start position:0%
i never thought i had uh constituents
who

00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
would write or email or phone but i
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
turned out to be wrong
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is uh kovit has brought out the
 
00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.870 align:start position:0%
this is uh kovit has brought out the
constituents

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
but i'm interested in getting back a
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
little more to uh
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh ways and means kinds of questions do
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
any idea of what likely
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
are apt to be the rules of the road so
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
in august do we think that they're going
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to be large
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
larger weddings or gatherings these are
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
the things that
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
particularly in the north country where
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
i live
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
the summer season is a very important
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
economic one
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
and people are wondering should they be
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
hiring people should they
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
be taking reservations and probably
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
you're in one of the better positions to
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
have an
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
answer to what we can expect
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
in august and september in the way of
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
how distancing people have to stay
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
whether you think they'll still be asked
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
to wear masks
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker and the
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
audio was a little um
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
low on that so i will um if i miss
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
anything please let me know
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
so i think you're asking a great
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
question and that's really sort of the
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
crystal ball question all of us have is
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
what's the summer really going to look
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
like um in some ways i think we can be
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
sure that um you know we will still be
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about mass squaring and social
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
distancing to some capacity
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
um so i don't think things will be 100
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
like it was in 2019
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
but uh the data is certainly indicating
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
as we continue to have the increase in
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine uptake
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
and the decrease in daily case counts
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
and hospitalizations and deaths
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
that there may be some opportunities for
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
some more flexibility than we had
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the summer of 2020. we have been
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
the governor's reopening task force has
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
been hard at work on this thinking about
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
what that might be i know i've spoken
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the hampton beach
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce as they're thinking
 
01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:08.549 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce as they're thinking
about

01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
what um what sort of events what what
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
they could be planning for um
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
the notion that outdoors is best is
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
probably something good that we can all
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
sort of take to the bank at this moment
 
01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:20.630 align:start position:0%
sort of take to the bank at this moment
that

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know outdoors is better than indoors
 
01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:23.829 align:start position:0%
you know outdoors is better than indoors
um

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
but that they're you know my you know
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
guess is that there will likely be
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
increased flexibility from where we were
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
where that line will be you know we will
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
work closely with the task force in the
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the governor you know will have the
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
ear of dr ben chan
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
and they will make some of those sort of
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
fine line decisions about
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know what's the the number of people
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
that can be gathering together
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
or you know exactly how um
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
things work but you know i am i'm taking
 
01:00:55.839 --> 01:00:56.630 align:start position:0%
things work but you know i am i'm taking
great

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
um comfort in the creative planning
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's happening among businesses
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
everywhere i've been working with
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
some performing art venues um thinking
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
about different ways that they do their
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
work you know whether it's a summer
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
stock playhouse that is moving outside
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
under a tent but they're still doing
 
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
a repertory um this summer which is
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
unlike last summer when they were
 
01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:17.910 align:start position:0%
unlike last summer when they were
shuttered

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
shuttered
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.309 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
southwood

01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
southwood
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
a following up for ways and means for
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
our estimates
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm concerned about a group that you
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
didn't really mention today
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that is the group that refuses to
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
follow any of the safety recommendations
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
we also have some groups who are not
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
going to take the vaccine
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
and often it sounds like we're having an
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
optimistic view of
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
progress which i certainly support but
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
we have people
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
actively working against progress and i
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
think that must be hard for you to
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
factor in
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and and that is true
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
um you know we have folks that for
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
whatever reason choose not to follow the
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
common sense safety measures that we've
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
all been following
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
for the past year wearing our mask
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
watching our distance washing our hands
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know that same old tired you know i
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
think we're all tired a year later we
 
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
are all have covered fatigue
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
we don't love it um but we know that if
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
we want to get to
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
the other side we're going to have to do
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
it and you know and right now
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
especially as we get towards the end of
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
winter here and we can sort of envision
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
that there could be spring happening
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and summer um you know i think most
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
of us are anxious to take off those
 
01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:32.789 align:start position:0%
of us are anxious to take off those
masks

01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
masks
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and especially as we get vaccinated
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be really
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
important for us to double down and stay
 
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.230 align:start position:0%
important for us to double down and stay
vigilant

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
vigilant
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
around some of those very basic things
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we should all be doing
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
in order to keep all of us safe so that
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
we can get those businesses open so that
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
we can go out and have those
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
outdoor activities and you know have
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
time at the beach or time in the
 
01:02:54.079 --> 01:02:54.789 align:start position:0%
time at the beach or time in the
mountains

01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
mountains
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
um and you know stop in and get a coffee
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
at our favorite coffee shop
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we can so you know we
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we're going to still
 
01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.029 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we're going to still
have

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
some things that are not normal um
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
but um you know we need everyone's
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
um cooperation and vigilance
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
to get us moving in the right direction
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
and really that means thinking about
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
what you do in those
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
informal groups businesses have done a
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous job
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
of adapting their business processes to
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
be able to be safe for their employees
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
customers and their public that comes in
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
them for the most part they've just
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
really done a great job
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
um it's sometimes we get a little bit um
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know when when we are in among our
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
family and friends in those informal
 
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.549 align:start position:0%
family and friends in those informal
gatherings

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
gatherings
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
is you know we found that that's really
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
the time that we let our guard down
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
and we take those masks off and we get
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
too close and that's when we begin to
 
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
too close and that's when we begin to
see

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
spread follow-up
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so just uh um
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
again you said it very well we need
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
everyone's cooperation
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
to have this outlook for summer and so
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
on but we do not
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so it just makes me think for ways
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
and means that the problem is going to
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
go on
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
longer because we do not have that
 
01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.829 align:start position:0%
longer because we do not have that
cooperation

01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know you know again we have no magic
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
crystal ball of what
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
what the exact amount of time will be
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
but we need everyone's cooperation
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
we've worked closely with um you know
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
even health officers and communities and
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
even our attorney general's office to
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
provide education
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
to um you know business owners so that
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
they can do the right thing
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
and we we need folks to um pay attention
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
and really work together as a community
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
for us all to move forward
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question you've
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
addressed it once they heard immunity
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
well the way things are going right now
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
the progress that you're making
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
when do and if it continues that way
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
when do you think we may be hitting
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
the herd immunity point great thank you
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative major chair
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
um you know it's unclear
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
as as i've said i think everything i've
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
said today is unclear so i'm a very
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory um
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
speaker for you today i think um but
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
um we you know the experts are saying
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
something like 70 75
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
is the sort of classic sense of hurt
 
01:05:23.039 --> 01:05:23.990 align:start position:0%
is the sort of classic sense of hurt
immunity

01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated um i we don't
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
know how you know i can't give you the
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
mathematical formula for that because i
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
don't know the
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
amount of vaccine that we're going to
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
have available and people's uptake of
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
that vaccine
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
those are the wild cards in that
 
01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.829 align:start position:0%
those are the wild cards in that
calculation

01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
um you know as i mentioned earlier the
 
01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:43.109 align:start position:0%
um you know as i mentioned earlier the
governor

01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
is suggest he's he's not he's
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
um considering the fact that we may not
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
get there but that will
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
have enough other protective practices
 
01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:53.109 align:start position:0%
have enough other protective practices
um

01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
in place to get us closer to you know
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
reopening some of those businesses or
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
allowing businesses to have some more
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility so vaccine and herd immunity
 
01:06:02.319 --> 01:06:02.630 align:start position:0%
flexibility so vaccine and herd immunity
is

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
an important tool in the toolbox but it
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
is not everything as
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
as we were just noting you know we're
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
going to continue for
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know at least some time now that
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to wear masks
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
in when we're around people that are not
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
in our pod
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
and we're going gonna need to social
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
distance um for a little bit longer
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
um in order to get through this
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
especially as we try and get those
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
those people vaccinated you know i i
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
think some of the numbers
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
um we're at 11 12 12 probably right
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
now of new hampshire being um having at
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
least one dose
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
that's a long way away from 70 but we
 
01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:39.910 align:start position:0%
that's a long way away from 70 but we
are

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know we have appointments every day
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
for people getting vaccinated
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
and you know our main goal right now is
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
to get those most
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
at risk vaccinated um because that's
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
you know ethically and and even
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
economically and the impact to our
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
health care system we need to make sure
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
that those most at risk are not in our
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals or
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
have the worst of the outcomes of
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
commitment so i'm sorry i don't have a
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
number for you
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
that has to do with
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
isn't the public health system
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh giving out examples
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
more that if you don't wear a mask this
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
is what's going to happen to the
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
surrounding air that somebody else is
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to be breathing i don't see any of
 
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.549 align:start position:0%
going to be breathing i don't see any of
that

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
but the things that people have told me
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
is that the droplets get into the air
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
they spread out the more windy it is
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
the more they go and that doesn't seem
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be publicized
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
enough i think if it was publicized
 
01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:52.789 align:start position:0%
enough i think if it was publicized
enough

01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
people might change their mind about
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
so is there why isn't publicized in us
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question i think
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
we have tried and certainly cdc has lots
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
of great
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
pieces of information out there we know
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
those respiratory droplets you know
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
i wear my mask um to keep
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know you safe it also provides a
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
layer of protection for me
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
um i think um those droplets go out
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
there and then they drop
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
um although we do know that there's
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
still some aerosol that floats
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
in the in the air which is why things
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
like ventilation systems are so
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
important indoors um i think it's
 
01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.590 align:start position:0%
important indoors um i think it's
complex

01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
um and i think people do not like
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
wearing masks
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
um that's probably the the you know the
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
most obvious thing i've said all day
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
people don't like it
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
um it's um you know it can be
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable although i think many of
 
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:46.870 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable although i think many of
us

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
um you know uh can't even imagine right
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
now a time where you look at a movie or
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
a tv show and you see people in a
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know bar or restaurant close
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
together with no mask that was pretty
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
foreign at this point of why would
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
anyone ever have done that
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
before so i think you're right i think
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
we need to continue to stay
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
on message and let people know um
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
what they can do to protect themselves
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
um we certainly heard about a week or
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
two ago there was a
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
little bit of a bubble in the media
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
around double masking
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
and you know some of the benefits that
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
could be conveyed with double masking
 
01:09:19.759 --> 01:09:20.309 align:start position:0%
could be conveyed with double masking
especially

01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
wearing a like a a lighter sort of
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
hospital grade mask
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
um the procedure mask in 95 but you know
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
the little procedure mask with the
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
cloth mask on top of it as we are um
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know to provide perhaps even more
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
protection with those new variants
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
floating around
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
um but if you are correct we may need to
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
go back to the beginning and remind
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
people why it is that we're doing all of
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
these things in the first place
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you patricia that was
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
a great presentation he made and
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
and all the answers to the various
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions i think
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
will help out the committee here but
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
i don't okay there's one more hand up um
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative elliot uh thank you mr
 
01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.709 align:start position:0%
representative elliot uh thank you mr

i want to apologize to director tilley
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%

uh that was most on gentlemanly of me
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
so i apologize i'm sure it's well taken
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and you provide us

your slides
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
yes i will send those over to
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
christopher wright when i get off and i
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
will provide that
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
case definition for the cdc case
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
definition as well thank you very much
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you now committee we're going to
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
have to get back to
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes have
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
come in the the dra representatives
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
and chris could you bring up
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
so the the worksheet i just brought up
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
is the same worksheet that represent
 
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
is the same worksheet that represent
major

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
um sent out yesterday to i think all the
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
the only difference this there's three
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
things that i adjusted
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
where it said hi lo house ways and means
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
low and high estimates
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
there was no designation ever that was
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
the republican estimate so i put that in
 
01:11:52.239 --> 01:11:53.669 align:start position:0%
the republican estimate so i put that in
there

01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
i provided a another row so that when
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
the committee comes to an agreement that
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
it'll be clearly
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
noted in the documents and i bolded it
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
so you can see there's already some
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
areas where the committee has come to
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
some agreement on the revenue estimates
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing i did is i just
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
renumbered the rows
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that you can reference a row number
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh the bolded one two
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
three four um you know whichever one you
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
might need to so those are the only
 
01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.030 align:start position:0%
might need to so those are the only
changes

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
that were made to the document that
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
represent major sent out to you uh
 
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.750 align:start position:0%
represent major sent out to you uh
yesterday

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay um i think we might as well
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
go right to the business taxes which is
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
we are tough this month
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
and in the data we have the
 
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
republicans estimates for the low and
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
the high
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
we have the democrats estimate which is
 
01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:47.430 align:start position:0%
we have the democrats estimate which is
the

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
medium of their low and high
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then we have a line says
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimate minus
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
the republicans median and then the
 
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.590 align:start position:0%
the republicans median and then the
governor's

01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
estimate minus the dam medium
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
the dens estimate and then which set
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
which shows that if you have a negative
 
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.950 align:start position:0%
which shows that if you have a negative
number

01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
such as on line
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
21 at 600 000
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
which means the governor is less
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it means the governor is
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
higher sorry
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
no it's it's less because it's the
 
01:13:36.719 --> 01:13:37.350 align:start position:0%
no it's it's less because it's the
governor

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
minus so
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
the republican medium is greater than
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
by 600 000. in line 22
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
is greater than governor by
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
estimate should be or
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
or why the estimates are such as that
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
the six hundred thousand dollars on the
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
republican medium is so darn close
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
but the fifty one hundred uh five point
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
one million dollars
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
difference on the dens
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
is there somebody that might want to
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
represent almond and
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to explain that i was
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
hoping to get
 
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay we have the dra here
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah there's that we're talking about uh
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
21 at this point so it's just question
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
about whether there are original
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
changes about on taking
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
the revenues down due to
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
as assuming that the extension payments
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
and returns
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
in march to april were going to come
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
in on lower uh
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
were going to come in as lower than
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
what on they usually would do
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
because right now we're on track to some
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
somebody the dra want to address that
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
sure good morning for good morning mr
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
chair for the record melissa rollins
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
senior financial analyst
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i also have on me on here with me
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
devon rodrick
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
um financial analyst and carolyn lear
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative elmi um
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
i think we i agree with you there has
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
been some great performance so far for
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
i think we are still hesitant
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
at looking at what those returns and
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
extensions may be
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit tough because we
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
haven't been in this situation before
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
with covid as you know so
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
normally we can pretty much correlate
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
what estimates are looking like and
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
tie that out to returns and extension
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
payments and we have a pretty good idea
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
how the year is going to end and a
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
pretty good way to model it
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
however we are hesitant that
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
in what we've heard anecdotally and this
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
may be for some of the smaller and
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
medium-sized businesses versus the
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
larger businesses
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of the estimate payments
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
were made based on
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
um estimate payments last year
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case if these
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
businesses did take a loss we're gonna
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
see that true up come in
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
in march and april on these returns and
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
extension payments
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh that may be the same for large
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
businesses i think we're still sort of
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye on them although we do
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
know some businesses have been
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
performing well
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
we do see the news articles in the
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
online saying they've been performing
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
well but we just don't know how much of
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is going to be offset by any
 
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.030 align:start position:0%
that is going to be offset by any
decreased

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
decreased
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
lost felt during this covid uh covid
 
01:17:30.159 --> 01:17:30.709 align:start position:0%
lost felt during this covid uh covid
period

01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
so you are correct i think i had sent an
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
email yesterday to you concerning this
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
that our low
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
does have a reduction of 18 for returns
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
and extensions
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
and that is based on some modeling we
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
were able to do
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
based on the last recession even though
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
i know they are not similar so we did
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
make some
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
economic adjustments to match this
 
01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
economic adjustments to match this
session

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
so i think that is definitely our low
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we're feeling
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
as more data comes in that that low
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
might be too low especially with some of
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
the offset that we've received
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
this month and then in our high we still
 
01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:08.550 align:start position:0%
this month and then in our high we still
did

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
account for a loss but at half that loss
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
at nine percent for returns and
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
extension payments
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
again i just want to know um we've
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
worked with you for
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
for many years on revenue estimates and
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
this by far
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
is definitely our hardest year to
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
estimate this out
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
so feel free to um ask any further
 
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.510 align:start position:0%
so feel free to um ask any further
questions

01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
or or land where you feel it's necessary
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
to land because it is
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
it is a challenging situation this year
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have nothing to model it up after
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
let me say some words on the framework
 
01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.149 align:start position:0%
let me say some words on the framework
here

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
is that it would be nice to be able to
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
do a house resolution this week
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
if we don't finish this and then we
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
won't do a house resolution this week
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
we would just give the
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
finance committee a range we we have to
 
01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.149 align:start position:0%
finance committee a range we we have to
remember

01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
that march and april are
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
the ones that really tell us better than
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
what the revenues are really going to be
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
end of fy21
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
and it would be that would be the basis
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
of going forward to fy 22 and
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
23. so we will be looking
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
at the revenues and making
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments every month
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
so what we if we give the revenues to
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
the house resolution
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
today they will be
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted on the basis of
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
how the economy changes in a month
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
in march i mean in april and then in may
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
in june and right up to the time we do
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
the committee a conference
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
with the senate on the final budget
 
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.669 align:start position:0%
with the senate on the final budget
passing

01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
passing
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
because the whole thing is so volatile
 
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:08.709 align:start position:0%
because the whole thing is so volatile
one

01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
one big thing we haven't even hit yet
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
is that congress is going to come up
 
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.189 align:start position:0%
is that congress is going to come up
with

01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
a super super
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
stimulus package 1.9 trillion dollars
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
and we're not sure what that's going to
 
01:20:24.639 --> 01:20:25.590 align:start position:0%
and we're not sure what that's going to
entail

01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
entail
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
and that may throw everything out of
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
whack it
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
may be for the good i would assume
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
and for that but we don't know that yet
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
but we will know that
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully within the month
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
of what congress is passing so the whole
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
thing is volatile
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
but i want you to know that because of
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
the volatility
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
we will every month we be adjusting our
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
but we need to get something to the
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee so they have a goal
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
so what do we need to do
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
i've got a question okay
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
james did you did you say representative
 
01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.030 align:start position:0%
james did you did you say representative
ames

01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
ames
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes i did oh i'm sorry i didn't hear um
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
yeah uh this is a question about um a
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
single number or two numbers
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
and um i say at the outset it would be
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
helpful to know
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
if the republican caucus is
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
willing or ready or whether we need to
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot of conversation around
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
this question of of trying to reach to
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
a single number and then just a word or
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
two about the democrats
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
using coming coming forward with a
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
single number
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's not that uh that we all agree
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
um i think it's more that
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
we all agree that there's there's
 
01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
we all agree that there's there's
uncertainty

01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
uncertainty
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
and uh there's a lot here that
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
serves beyond our powers of prediction
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's that crystal ball that was
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
referenced in the
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
previous presentation um there
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
are so many different variables that
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
come to bear that and it's what uh dra
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
just said
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
they've never seen a year as difficult
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
as this one
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh or as uh a uh biennium as
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
as difficult as this one to estimate for
 
01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.390 align:start position:0%
as difficult as this one to estimate for
uh

01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
so i think we we felt that
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
we a single number
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the middle of the rough range
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
that we thought was reasonable
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
taking uh taking giving significant
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
weight to what dra had done
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
because uh they spend more time on this
 
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:57.910 align:start position:0%
because uh they spend more time on this
and

01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh worry about it more perhaps we all
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
worry about it i shouldn't say that but
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh the they uh uh
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
are have come forward with uh estimates
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
that should be given credibility so
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
um that's that's background for for our
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
moving to a single number
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
and back to my original question
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
and whether we can all get to a single
 
01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.910 align:start position:0%
and whether we can all get to a single
number

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's the way the
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
republican caucus would like to go
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
towards a single number and then if that
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
is different then maybe we could put the
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
difference it's not going to make that
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
much difference right now because
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
and and the numbers that we come up with
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
for fy
 
01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:55.030 align:start position:0%
for fy
21

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
so you're talking something like about
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
five and a half million dollars
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
now the middle would be two and a half
 
01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
now the middle would be two and a half
minutes

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have a problem with that i
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't either mr chair
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um look we only have five
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
revenue streams that are in contention
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
and each one of those is three three
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
numbers three different votes
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
so we got we're talking about 15 votes
 
01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.390 align:start position:0%
so we got we're talking about 15 votes
uh

01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
most of them are pretty close
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh democrats and republicans are
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
actually pretty close
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm in the camp of with the exception
 
01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:42.550 align:start position:0%
so i'm in the camp of with the exception
of

01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
23 fiscal year 23 business taxes
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have to have a discussion on that
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
one but all the other ones i think we
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
could just split the difference
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh i have the numbers i just i took the
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
the democrat average
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
and the republican average add them
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
together divide by two
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
for instance or 21
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
that would be 107.5 million for
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
20 21 for republicans
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
and 812 million for democrats
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
so that average is 109.75
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
you don't mean 109. i i would simply
 
01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.950 align:start position:0%
you don't mean 109. i i would simply
move

01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
let's go with 109.75 i mean
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
800 809 i'm sorry
 
01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
before we move stuff on
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
we had on first
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
i would if we were not going to a single
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
number i would go to wider
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
ranges than what we had so
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
there is too much uncertainty um
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
but we had on
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
at least eight million worth of
 
01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.750 align:start position:0%
at least eight million worth of
anomalies

01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
anomalies
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
i believe on melissa told
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative ames on a couple of days
 
01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.030 align:start position:0%
representative ames on a couple of days
ago

01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
in february and they don't have anything
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
to do with 22 but
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
they are there in 21.
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
um she was talking about
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
maybe um maybe the 18
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
off was a little too much i've been
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
thinking about the ppe
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh effects that we've already had
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
and uh though we we are taxing them at
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
this point but
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
on the tax on them is pretty minor stuff
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh for the amount they got
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
i would i really think
 
01:26:59.530 --> 01:26:59.540 align:start position:0%
that on the
 
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.030 align:start position:0%
that on the
[Music]

01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
the number in the middle is a lot closer
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
to the one that the democrats came up
 
01:27:06.719 --> 01:27:08.070 align:start position:0%
to the one that the democrats came up
with

01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
then than that thank you
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that we don't
 
01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.030 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that we don't
look

01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i i personally would object to that
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
i think we're ending
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
at at least at what the democrat
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
democratic estimate was which is
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh 10 million 12 million less than the
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
and the agency numbers are are more
 
01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:52.470 align:start position:0%
and the agency numbers are are more
recent

01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
recent
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
and just of affirmed as
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
as more recent uh than the governors
 
01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.750 align:start position:0%
as more recent uh than the governors
were

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
you know you can put 20
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they make an estimate and probably
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
almost everyone will be a little
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
different and what do they do
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
they'll end up getting rid of the
 
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.070 align:start position:0%
they'll end up getting rid of the
outliers

01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
outliers
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
and coming up with an average for one
 
01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.790 align:start position:0%
and coming up with an average for one
number

01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's the same procedure that
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
recommending here
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
each caucus looked at these things
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
weighted all the
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
evidence and came up with their ranges
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
and made them
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
with the range and so
 
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
the recommendation is should we split
 
01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.550 align:start position:0%
the recommendation is should we split
that

01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
now represent ames
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.310 align:start position:0%
 
who

01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
splitting the differences between
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
on the business taxes let's say
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
taking the average of splitting the
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
difference the average between the
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
explain that difference who would not
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
agree to that you know if you don't want
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
to agree just raise your hand
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
into faith by it raising your hand
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't hear the question clearly uh
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
could you remember and you can't see it
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
again and maybe talk louder
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
agreeing to taken the difference between
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
the averages of the republicans
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
and the average of the democrats
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
splitting the
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
taking that number as our first
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
and i think and ruxin aims
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
you agree with that procedure
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
yes i do okay
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't agree with that
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
procedure just
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
we click the raised hand if we don't
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
well the raised hands go to the top and
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
oh there's a single number you're asking
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
us to read you maybe you need to repeat
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
the number
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's important that you
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
repeat the number
 
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay if we take the
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
number the midpoint
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
of the republican number yes
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
midpoint for the democrat number
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
and we find out what the difference is
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
and we split it in order to be able to
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
one number that we both agree on this is
 
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.830 align:start position:0%
one number that we both agree on this is
our

01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:57.450 align:start position:0%
first number it's appointment
 
01:31:57.450 --> 01:32:02.470 align:start position:0%
first number it's appointment
[Music]

01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
can you say the number okay and you did
 
01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:07.060 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.390 align:start position:0%
the um
[Music]

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
hey um chris would you populate what
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
i have 809.75 but
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
i have that as well right so 809.75
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
yup that's what i got as well
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
so 0.9.75
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
i certainly can agree with that
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things is who doesn't and
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
they look like a boat afterwards on
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
everything but right now i want to show
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
our hands who does not agree with that
 
01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.870 align:start position:0%
our hands who does not agree with that
number

01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
do you want that in the raised hand
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
function or do you actually want people
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
to raise their hands on the screen
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
because we're still sharing a screen
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
and then we have one understand
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
so we'll go over the 809.8
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
for fy21
 
01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:28.950 align:start position:0%
for fy21
fy22

01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
what would that be we're a lot closer on
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
yeah the republicans are
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
825 825 million
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh or billion 825
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
and um democrats are at 8 28. we're very
 
01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.709 align:start position:0%
and um democrats are at 8 28. we're very
close

01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
very close so just take the average
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
now this one
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very wild it's the most
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
volatile than there is
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
everything is going to get thrown at us
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
the result of the uh
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the stimulus ones uh the pandemic
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
we vary by 10 million dollars and i'd
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
say let's split the difference
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
so i think susan almighty has her hand
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you on a single sales factor is
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether you've included
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
that in your thoughts
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
i included that and market-based
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
sourcing from
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
what the dra sent
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
on in my thoughts last night
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i on i increased it for market-based
 
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.709 align:start position:0%
and i on i increased it for market-based
sourcing

01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
i decreased it for single sales factor
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
and i ended up with 835 again
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
so i really think that we need to
 
01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.229 align:start position:0%
so i really think that we need to
specifically

01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
know that we are including single sales
 
01:35:23.119 --> 01:35:23.990 align:start position:0%
know that we are including single sales
factor

01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
factor
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
would you um give us your thoughts
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
on including the central sales factor
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
sure i know we've had a lot of emails
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
going back and forth
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
um and this is a tricky and tough topic
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh as you know when we've looked at this
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
before in the fiscal impact
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
it is indeterminable on our side
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
we've we've talked some about
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing and how um we've
 
01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:57.350 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing and how um we've
have

01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
we have a memo out there actually that i
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
think you all have
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh that talks about we did look at a a
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
core sample
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers and i'll just explain a
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
little bit with market-based sourcing
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
that in order to determine a fiscal
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
impact for market-based sourcing which
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
went into effect
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
on january 1st of this year you really
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
need to look at taxpayers
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
records uh because it needs to be
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
audited and drilled down to see about
 
01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:22.709 align:start position:0%
audited and drilled down to see about
those

01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
intangible sales so we were able to look
 
01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:26.390 align:start position:0%
intangible sales so we were able to look
yeah

01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
a small group representative represented
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
and audit was able to drill down and we
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
did come up with an estimated impact of
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
10 million
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
however that is a very rough estimate i
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
want to qualify that
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of factors that
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
can play into that
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
based on how many people are now coming
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
in that we're gaining for market-based
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
sourcing and then how many people we are
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
losing as those sales are now
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
sourced to other states that were
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
previously sourced to us
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
so market-based sourcing i think we can
 
01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.350 align:start position:0%
so market-based sourcing i think we can
say

01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
we think will potentially be a revenue
 
01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:05.990 align:start position:0%
we think will potentially be a revenue
increaser

01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
increaser
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
at a minimum level and how much we're
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
not sure if we did the 10 million
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
estimate it's rough but at least we can
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
give you that much
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
with single sales factor it gets a
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
little bit tricky
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
so that current law is set to go in
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
place on january 1st
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
of next year 2022. uh we also have a
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
memo on that which you've seen and i
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
believe we've sent around to everybody
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
the latest fiscal impact that we did
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
which was in october
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's again if you look at it tricky
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
because one we don't have market based
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
sourcing returns in yet to compare
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
what the single sales factor will look
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
like for these new taxpayers
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
we only can really do a an analysis
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
the old cost of performance method so we
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
did do that because we're trying to
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to get some information out to
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
and then looking at that you can see
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
that it does swing
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
in the first few years that we look at
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
it it does swing positive to negative
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
a pretty a pretty good amount so in 2014
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
it was a 9.7 million dollar revenue
 
01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.750 align:start position:0%
it was a 9.7 million dollar revenue
increase

01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
and then in 17
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
it was a 17 million dollar decrease and
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
in 18 because we know there was a large
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
large increase in revenues a large
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
federal tax reform
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
repatriated returns were filed
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
it's a 68.2 million dollar decrease in
 
01:38:31.119 --> 01:38:31.750 align:start position:0%
it's a 68.2 million dollar decrease in
revenue

01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
again that's under the cost of
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
performance not the market-based
 
01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.070 align:start position:0%
performance not the market-based
sourcing

01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult to tell because of
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
this swing and what the taxpayers are
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
in future years and what their sales are
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to look like whether it's going to
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
be a positive or a negative
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
based on what we've seen it looks like
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's a negative loss on more
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the years than the positive gain
 
01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.390 align:start position:0%
of the years than the positive gain
however

01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
what that loss looks like and if there
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
will be a loss is
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
is really indeterminable for us we have
 
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
no way to see it because of these two
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
separate laws coming in hand in hand
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
however once we do have a year of
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
market-based records
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
in hand we'll be able to look at those
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
records and say what a single
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
sales analysis would look like
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
so this one is tricky we don't have a
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
definitive answer
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
we've tried to slice and dice it and we
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and we'll have better
 
01:39:27.119 --> 01:39:28.310 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and we'll have better
information

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
from the end of april once the
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
march and april revenues are coming in
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
but still it's going to be
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
dicey and uh
 
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
i'd rather be on the conservative side
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i'd go along with splitting it right
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
so they
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
there's 10 million dollar difference so
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
it'd be 20
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
right down the middle would be 26.1
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
then

01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
what would that final number be pat
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
i gotta calculate it because i was if
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
you think that's okay we'll go that way
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
um well let's see what the number looks
 
01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:22.790 align:start position:0%
um well let's see what the number looks
like

01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right uh that's going to be going
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
splitting it down the middle okay so
 
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
democrat uh mithwine is 835.
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
right on representative major
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
yes could i ask
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
would you on go
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
to the floor with an explanation that
 
01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.470 align:start position:0%
to the floor with an explanation that
this

01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
includes some idea of the losses
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
that could be there to single sales
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
factor or are you going to ignore it
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
entirely because
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
i do believe that there
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh it is likely that the situation will
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
be like the 18
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
one with major
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
corporations having major profits and
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
that there will be losses on
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
and we are trying to get
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
the senate to delay implementation until
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
we know what we're doing
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
and being able to go
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
to to the floor
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
including that in the estimate would
 
01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.109 align:start position:0%
including that in the estimate would
help

01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
with that regard thank you right and
 
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:48.950 align:start position:0%
with that regard thank you right and
delaying

01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
delaying
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh it won't affect what we're trying to
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
do right now
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
because we still have to use the current
 
01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.350 align:start position:0%
because we still have to use the current
law

01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
but anyway yes it's the current law
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
so the current law
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
says that we are more likely than not to
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
be losing revenue
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
in 2023
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes and no and
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
but i think with the two caucuses
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms the difference between
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
the midpoint of the
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats is is two
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
what would be the result
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
is the number okay 302 for republicans
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
300 for
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
democrats uh averages to 301
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay and then uh
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement on the
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
and again we're so close
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
so the average the average is uh
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
the uh republican number is uh 350
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
democrat numbers 349.
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
so the average would be 349.5
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
i mean we're almost identical
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay let me see does anybody have a
 
01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:26.790 align:start position:0%
okay let me see does anybody have a
problem

01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco the difference
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
is two and a half million dollars
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
between the republicans and the
 
01:44:48.239 --> 01:44:52.149 align:start position:0%
between the republicans and the
democrats

01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah republican the republican average
 
01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
yeah republican the republican average
was

01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh 246.5
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
and the democrats were 249.
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
247.8 20. you know okay
 
01:45:17.970 --> 01:45:17.980 align:start position:0%
wait a minute yeah 247.8 yep
 
01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.229 align:start position:0%
wait a minute yeah 247.8 yep
[Music]

01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i mean there's a very small
 
01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.629 align:start position:0%
and i mean there's a very small
difference

01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:30.290 align:start position:0%
on fy22 so what would that result in
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:32.189 align:start position:0%
on fy22 so what would that result in
[Music]

01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:32.199 --> 01:45:34.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
244.75

01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
244.75
 
01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:37.510 align:start position:0%
244.75
244.8

01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's a three million dollar swing so
 
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
the average would be
 
01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:53.750 align:start position:0%
the average would be
240.5

01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay the liquor transfer an agreement
 
01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:06.470 align:start position:0%
okay the liquor transfer an agreement
[Music]

01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
and then interesting dividend
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
we're pretty close there's 500 it's a
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
republicans are 128.5 the democrats are
 
01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.390 align:start position:0%
republicans are 128.5 the democrats are
129

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
129
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
very close so the average would be
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's a half a million dollar
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
it should be 130 do you have a number on
 
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.669 align:start position:0%
it should be 130 do you have a number on
that

01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
which one are you on the second year now
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
sec for fiscal 22 yes
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh okay so republicans were at uh
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
136 and the democrats were at 137 again
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
very close
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
man off the average of those would be
 
01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:54.790 align:start position:0%
man off the average of those would be
136.5

01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think that communication republicans
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
are like 137
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
on the interest in dividend yeah on
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
interesting dividends
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
now for the communication let's
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
aim for everybody
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
i think we're all agreed yeah and then
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
for real estate is a half a million
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
dollar difference between us
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
yep uh uh republicans were at 190
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
1.5 democrats were 192.
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know again very close so the average
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
it would be 180.25 is it 180.3
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
right then the last number
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
is 23 for transfer
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh republicans were at 170.5
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
for their average democrats were at 167.
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay and that's those are all the
 
01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.669 align:start position:0%
okay and that's those are all the
numbers

01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
on what we did on coming up for the
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
numbers for the house resolution
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
great job i think with all of the
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
different factors
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
really i think we did about the best we
 
01:50:52.159 --> 01:50:53.990 align:start position:0%
really i think we did about the best we
could

01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have to do it again
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
and again and again
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
as we get more and more information
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
um so then we need to take a
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
roll call vote on this so
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
yes chris um
 
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
did you want to do a roll call vote for
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
each of the funding sources or did you
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
want to do one vote at the end
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
for general fund education trust fund
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
highway fund and fish and game
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah right it was
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
okay i'd rather do the whole bit at once
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.710 --> 01:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
in the highway fund
 
01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.070 align:start position:0%
in the highway fund
[Music]

01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
the republicans are going to accept the
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
agency's numbers
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to accept the agency
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
represent almighty
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that's what we said somebody
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
remind me
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
if we had any quibbles
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think we had quibbles i i don't
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
think we spent time on it but
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
if if somebody had equivalent we would
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
have spent time on it
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we did look at it i did it
 
01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:26.870 align:start position:0%
yeah we did look at it i did it
okay

01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
and fish and game the committee agreed
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
to last week to the numbers that are in
 
01:52:30.719 --> 01:52:32.550 align:start position:0%
to last week to the numbers that are in
here

01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
then let's just look at the at the total
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
the fishing game sorry let's go look at
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
the total for
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
if you can yeah that's it
 
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
so that fy 22 the total comes up to be
 
01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:11.790 align:start position:0%
so that fy 22 the total comes up to be
2.674

01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
2.725 and that's a growth
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
2.755 and that's about
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
um relative to the coverage number
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
we don't care whatever for me
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
these are our numbers but for
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't do it on our numbers
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
does anybody who changes it
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
more any changes that you want to make
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
then i'd like to have representative

thank you well
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
i thank everybody it's this is not easy
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
but we have to come to a compromise
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
and we know we're going to get a number
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
of more
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
bites of the apple as we get more
 
01:57:49.199 --> 01:57:50.310 align:start position:0%
bites of the apple as we get more
information

01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
and hopefully as we get more information
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be positive
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
we've had enough negative information to
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
last a lifetime
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
but anybody else need any want to make
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i thought it was very helpful to
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
have someone from
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.709 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
that although i didn't like hearing what
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
she had to say
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was very helpful thank you
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
for pursuing that
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
she knew her business didn't she yes
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and she was willing to take the
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
slings and arrows
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
when i talked to the commissioner about
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
getting somebody here
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
and she was sent a real good present
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
or any other comments from anybody
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
then uh i i do have a comment
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
if any of the bills that we have on
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
gets pulled off those that made the
 
01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:03.510 align:start position:0%
gets pulled off those that made the
motion

01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
and i've sent your name in i'm get up to
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
speak to defend that bill
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
and then i'll do the pi hopefully
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
we won't have any of these bills pulled
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
off to consent but be prepared
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
as if they're going to be pulled off
 
01:59:19.119 --> 01:59:22.390 align:start position:0%
as if they're going to be pulled off
consent

01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
and then next week on tuesday
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
and wednesday all the remaining bills
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
we are going to have a work session and
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
those that we can take care of
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
on on tuesday and we'll exact them out
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
and we need a further amendment for that
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
and we'll take care of them on wednesday
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
of those that we feel that we don't have
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
enough time to fix them
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
and and we would like to
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
work on them and we'll vote to retain
 
01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:00.950 align:start position:0%
work on them and we'll vote to retain
them

02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
and those that we don't like will just
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
but the discussion that people have had
 
02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:09.830 align:start position:0%
but the discussion that people have had
on

02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 15 has been a very
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
interesting discussion this
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
led to areas that i hadn't considered
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
myself and
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
so i think we're there so
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
any questions yes
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative romney so um um yes chris
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
do you think oh when will all uh ols
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
have this uh
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
so the intention is to give them um a
 
02:00:41.119 --> 02:00:41.830 align:start position:0%
so the intention is to give them um a
draft

02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
draft
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
resolution by noon today okay i've
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
already talked to them last week and
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
they've got a shell
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
lsr set up in the format that your
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
resolutions typically are
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
so i expect it would be fairly quick
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
so it could go tomorrow then some of
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
that depends on um
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
how many amendments and other things
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
that they're drafting right now
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
related to the session or other
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
committees that are doing work
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that that's the one factor but i did
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
let them know i needed something by the
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
end of today
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
so the representative major could have
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
that and take a look at it and share
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
with whoever he needs to share with
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
and then getting it on your agenda for
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
attention is to have
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
thursday night
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh i would like to have
 
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.390 align:start position:0%
and then uh i would like to have
representative

02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to do that we're going
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
to be in
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
opposite ends of the hall it sounds like
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like a hall it sounds like
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i got a question not a question a
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
comment so tomorrow
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
when we do consent calendar pay
 
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
attention after
 
02:02:05.589 --> 02:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
the consent vote because then the the uh
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
clerk is going to start reading off
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
names of committees that
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
these the second committee bills are
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i usually try to keep track of of how
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
many bills we're going to get
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
when off the consent and then after each
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
one of the bills is passed out of the
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know the other non non-consent bills
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
after the debate and if it passes then
 
02:02:29.199 --> 02:02:29.750 align:start position:0%
after the debate and if it passes then
the

02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
