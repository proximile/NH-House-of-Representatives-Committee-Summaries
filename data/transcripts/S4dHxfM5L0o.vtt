00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
we relearned that there are no free
 
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
lunches I went down to get something
 
00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
from the Cancer Society and ended up
 
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
getting an earful of why we need to fund
 
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
the tobacco secession program so I was

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 align:start position:0%

um so so welcome
 
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
and I forget the the great title oh
 
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
commandant you're the new commandant we
 
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
Peggy lebreck has been there for what
 
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 align:start position:0%
five six years prior to you and she I
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
think was a commandant for probably
 
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
seven years but yes Peggy retired last
 
00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
March um but I came in last January so
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
the good news is you've been all through
 
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
the budget process this is this is
 
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
basically your your budget proposal and
 
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
not something you inherited yes oh great
 
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
one should both introduce yourself for
 
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Kim McKay I'm the
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
commandant New Hampshire Veterans Home
 
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm Stephanie Kelly I'm the business
 
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
administrative Veterans Home
 
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll encourage you each time to get
 
00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
as close to the microphone as possible
 
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
and it's it's really for two reasons one
 
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
we're broadcasting and taping taping
 
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and plus I'm deaf so if you use the
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
microphones it helps so so go ahead and
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
tell us what you want to tell us so
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
speaking to you is this our budget it is
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
our budget I will say that our CFO was
 
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
deployed so I was speaking to him from
 
00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
deployment this morning just to get some
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
more talking points for this budget so
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
um you're getting me instead of him so
 
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
um this is the operating budget for
 
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
24.25 and in this slide deck I put in
 
00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
there some slides about the history I'm
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
not sure if everybody's been to the New
 
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans home or is aware of
 
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire veterans home but it
 
00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
was established in 1890 served Civil War
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
veterans and now obviously we serve all
 
00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start position:0%
veterans that qualify we are 20 250 bed
 
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 align:start position:0%
facility long-term care no skilled care
 
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
and we are supported by the VA and the
 
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
residents themselves along with the
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
general funds so the way it breaks down
 
00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 align:start position:0%
is 47 of General funds uh U.S Department
 
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
of Veterans Affairs is 29 in individuals
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
resident room and board is 24 percent
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
right now we have a budget for 225
 
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.650 align:start position:0%
right now we have a budget for 225
residents

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 align:start position:0%
um we have not budget up to the 250 Mark
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
so we've stay at 225
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
this is the short answer for that for
 
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
the difference is that is a Manpower
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
challenge or we just didn't give you
 
00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 align:start position:0%
enough money and yeah we've given you
 
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
more money you still wouldn't have the
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
people I wouldn't have 250. no I think
 
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
that it's still Manpower and we're going
 
00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
to talk about censuses that we go in
 
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
here because we are really experiencing
 
00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
that um that issue uh the mission of the
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Veterans Home is to
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
provide the best quality of life for New
 
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans with dignity honor
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
and respect and I will tell you uh that
 
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
is uh seen throughout all of our staff
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
they truly loved what they're doing for
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
work there our current census is when we
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
talk about census is 129 residents today
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
118 men with 11 women the average age is
 
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
83 and the average stay for us is about
 
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
three years some much longer but average
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
stay is about three years
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
can I ask you a question about that I I
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
haven't flipped through your uh
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
presentation but
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
um when I've taken tours there uh you
 
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
had basically two Wards of roughly the
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
same size uh one was meant to explicitly
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
be like a dementia Alzheimer's Ward the
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
other was not intended for that but
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
nevertheless it's my memory says you had
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
75 percent of those patients were
 
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
nevertheless having experiencing they
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
were experiencing dementia is that still
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
roughly true yes sir so uh maybe not to
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
the point where living on a uh we call
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
him a Ladue Life Enhancement dementia
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
unit those units are reserved for people
 
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
who may be wandering risks and for their
 
00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
safety they're in that unit
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
um but yes about 75 percent have some
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
type of a memory disorder whether it's
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
due to Parkinson's or dementia but yes
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct all right thank you
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
um uh the always whenever we're asked so
 
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
to speak we talk about who what branches
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a very competitive thing if you
 
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
come to the veterans home which I would
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
openly welcome anybody who would like to
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
have a tour they're going to ask you
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
right away are you a veteran the
 
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
resident's going to ask you are you a
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
veteran and then what branch so I break
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
it down uh Air Force we have 28
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
residents Air Guard one resident Army 55
 
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 align:start position:0%
which is our biggest group of people
 
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard one Marines four and navy is
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
40 so they're right behind I'm a little
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
surprised and I'm surprised with this
 
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 align:start position:0%
breakout mostly because
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has more of a history of
 
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:26.890 align:start position:0%
having an Air Force present with peas
 
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.990 align:start position:0%
having an Air Force present with peas
[Music]

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
they're kind of low on this isn't it
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
they are about 28 Air Force yeah is that
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
because they just go somewhere else I
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm not sure all right I'm
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
not sure conflict era served we have 11
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%
World War II veterans right now honestly
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
every time I do this uh presentation it
 
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
I sadly see the number decrease Korean
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
conflict 42 residents Vietnam era is our
 
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
biggest group at 65 residents Gulf War
 
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
one and uh during peacetime 10 and I
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
think that's what we're going to see is
 
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see a lot of post
 
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.210 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see a lot of post
911

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:10.220 align:start position:0%
911
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
veterans coming in as our World War II
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
veterans um
 
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
Fade Out
 
00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
challenges and achievements there's two
 
00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:21.419 align:start position:0%
things that are really on the table and
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
that they're they're so interrelated and
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
one is Recruitment and Retention of
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
Staff both clinically and non-clinically
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
we've seen over the history for State
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
positions that people would take any
 
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
kind of position in the support services
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
just to get in the door and for the
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
first time we're really feeling those
 
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
vacancies like in our dietary food
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
service area but along with our clinical
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
which everybody is probably talked about
 
00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459 align:start position:0%
to you is that we have the challenge of
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
trying to find nurses and L A's
 
00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that we have
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
done to really try to tackle this issue
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
is launch into an internal LNA program
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
so we have uh we have gone to the board
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
of nursing we have been approved and
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
we've been teaching an L A course so we
 
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
do earn as you learn and we hire people
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
part-time as an l a trainee and then
 
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
they work with us while they're taking
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
the class in our facility working with
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
our veterans and then when they graduate
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
they commit to being with us for a year
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
so with that program in the last fiscal
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
year we've had been able to add 16 new
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
lnas to our um say the number again 16.
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
so and you think the 16 are going to
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
stick for at least a year at least a
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
year yes and but we don't have a lot of
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
experience yet on longer term retention
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
we don't no we just started this we've
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
had three classes we have another one
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
starting at the end of April beginning
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
of May how long is the class it takes
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
about eight to nine weeks and to go
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
through the class but we hired them
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
before that so they don't have to wait
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
until that time we'll be hiring them as
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
we go and they work part-time as a like
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
an l a trainee get to know our residents
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
they can do some of the things on site
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
and then once they're licensed they go
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
into a full-time position so so relative
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
to an LNA is an Mna more trained or or
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
not more trained more trained yes so the
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
second thing we did is we also went to
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing and submitted a
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum to teach the m a program
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
which is a medication nursing assistant
 
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
so you have to be an LNA to qualify for
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
two years and then pass a pre-test and
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
we we have to feel confident that you
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
can do those skills and so we have uh
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
got that program approved in the
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
meantime we would have been paying for
 
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
it out of our education fund to have
 
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
people take the class and that are
 
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
working for us because I really feel
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
like how we're going to retain people is
 
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
that we invest in them and we say it's
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
important that you're here and we're
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
we're glad you're here and if you want
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
to keep going let let's keep going we
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
would love to see them progress in their
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
education so the military has two
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
components on that one is they provide
 
00:10:59.569 --> 00:10:59.579 align:start position:0%
skills and education development but
 
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
then they also have the notion of an
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
obligated service and or in a payback if
 
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
you fail to meet your service are these
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
programs also connected to an obligation
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
as much as we can so as the state we
 
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
have asked them to they sign a learning
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
contract that says if they leave within
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
a year then their program is prorated so
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
if they stay for six months they have to
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
pay back the half of the cost of the
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
program we haven't had anybody leave yet
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
so we haven't had to challenge that I
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
don't know how much leeway we'll have on
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
that or how much enforcement we can have
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
but we ask them to commit to that and
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen them commit so far okay
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
we also have reclass a vacant position
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
that we had into a recruiter and just
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
specializing in recruitment so going to
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
job fairs doing reaches reach outs to
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
um colleges before high schools we're
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
speaking at high schools we're just
 
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
trying every Avenue we can to reach
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
those that might be interested in
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
working with the Americans Heroes so
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
we're trying really hard I'm back at the
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
l a thing because was there such
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues all over the place I
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
just want to see what we can maybe learn
 
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:07.820 align:start position:0%
from your experience
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
of these 16
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
what kind of demographic are we talking
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
about are we talking predominantly
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
female predominantly under the age of 25
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
or we getting a lot of folks coming out
 
00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:22.459 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce back into nursing well there's
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
been a little combination we actually
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
have had a couple of people from our
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Department who have been
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
with us for years
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
I would not want to venture a guess of
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
their age because they may not like that
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
probably over 25 over 25 that's a great
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
way to do that you wouldn't card them I
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
would not card them no no
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
um but we are seeing a younger group of
 
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
people come in
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
um I would say under 25 but the but
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's the majority but um we have staff
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
that have been with us that worked in
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
housekeeping and thought wow I'd really
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
like to be an LNA
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
um thought well let me try it and we've
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
had two staff members graduate and have
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
transferred from that department to
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
become an LNA so and then from a radius
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
perspective are they nearby and this was
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
really convenient yes yes sir do you
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
have any stats on what proximity we're I
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't but I can get those and get them
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
back to the committee it's not urgent
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
but I I just be curious because everyone
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
is trying to figure out how to solve
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
this part of the problem and I I just
 
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.060 align:start position:0%
would like to know what your success
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
criteria is representative thank you
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
very much an extension off of the
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
Chairman's inquiries into the program
 
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
can you give us an idea what the
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
starting pay is for someone who's
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
I would think 16 I think it was like 14
 
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
16 an hour
 
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so it's pretty low and
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's part of what we deal with on an
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis is that we're just not
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
competitive with the community it's
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
helped having the enhancements
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
um but we know that some of that
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
enhancement money is going away on June
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
30. and so we're hoping the raise will
 
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
help a little bit but it's really tough
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
to get people who want to dedicate uh
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
work any shift be mandated to stay
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
because if there's no one to come in for
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
that shift and they're going to have to
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
stay to provide the care and provide
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
very personal care to somebody for the
 
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
fees that we're paying
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
so because of the security of these
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
patients you really need a lot of
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
Hands-On support I'm guessing that this
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
isn't something that you're going to
 
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
really extend through telemedicine for
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
example this all has to be in the
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
building Hands-On yes sir yes sir
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
and have the personality to do it to to
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
be able to do that type of work
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
um so we've tried to improve onboarding
 
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
and retention with more support in
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
mentorship we're improving our
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
orientation so that people don't feel
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
like they just come into work for the
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
first day we do one day orientation and
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
send you out there we want to try to
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
provide more orientation we are
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
improving the communication when I came
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
the not all staff had email only about
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
50 percent did so we've upped the email
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
to include everyone we have received
 
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
some arpa funds to help with some
 
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
communication boards that are going to
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
go up in in our common areas so that one
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
if we're in an outbreak status for covid
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
or we have any kind of changes in the
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
way we do our business like wearing
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
goggles instead of not wearing goggles
 
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
those will be communicated to the staff
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
quickly and then we also do hero Awards
 
00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:37.019 align:start position:0%
where we just really recognize our staff
 
00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:41.459 align:start position:0%
for outstanding uh work that they do
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
that challenge goes in with low staff
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
that means that we can't meet the needs
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
for higher census and let me ask you
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
some questions about your census yes
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
here you say it's 131
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
based on about 50 Staffing
 
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.590 align:start position:0%
based on about 50 Staffing
um

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
I assume that there's kind of a step
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
increment here that as you get more
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
people you can incrementally fill more
 
00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:11.459 align:start position:0%
beds right yes so you know what how far
 
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:14.540 align:start position:0%
are you away from that next jump in
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
occupancy pretty far uh because right
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
now on our second shift nursing staff we
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
have about two full-time staff the rest
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
of the second shift is being staffed
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
with staff who are doing mandatory
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
overtime voluntary overtime and so
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's that second shift that we're
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
really feeling the lack of staff that
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
affects us and so we we did we were
 
00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
granted um through the fiscal the
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
finance committee and GNC at temporary
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
staffing contract that we came to for
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
last summer and that contract
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
um the company has been able to provide
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
zero people zero we have not had one
 
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
staff we've asked multiple times so at
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
this point we are rewriting a new
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
Staffing contract that will just be for
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
just nursing because these previous
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
Staffing contract was for nursing and
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
support staff and I think that might
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
have been the difficulty because nursing
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
companies staffing companies they
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
specialize in medical and so when you
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
add food service workers in there was
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
less of a choice for companies so we're
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
going to go back out and try
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
um so at 130 and I'm a little bit of
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
hurry because I know sorry I'm just
 
00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
trying to get us done at 1 30 and I I'm
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
the one that asks most of the questions
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
so it's my fault but at 131 you got to
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
have a wait list do you have a slide in
 
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
here that talks about your weight loss
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
our waitlist currently is 20 people have
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
been approved to come in but they don't
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a bed because we can't offer them a
 
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.169 align:start position:0%
have a bed because we can't offer them a
bed

00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
bed
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
an additional five who have been
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
approved and asked to don't want to come
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
in right now they want to be on the list
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
for a lot longer they feel like this was
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
just a step to make sure they could come
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
in and then we have about 65 other
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
people who have have an application and
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
process so it's in place in some form so
 
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
it might just be the first day they put
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
it in or they actually have are waiting
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
for their medical information or their
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
Finance so I may be imagining this but I
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
I think I was at like an S fact meeting
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
or something listen to the prior coming
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
down and I think she recommended
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
that even people
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
who don't need nursing home care now go
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
ahead and begin the application process
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that the paperwork sort of pre-done
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
and and so I'm a veteran and I'm just
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
wondering when I should fill out my
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
paperwork well I I have a different view
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
I feel that you should probably wait
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
until you need us or you're close to
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
needing us and I I don't think you look
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
like you're close to needing us yeah
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
depending on how this budget goes we
 
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
don't know okay all right so I don't
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
need to be worrying about you don't need
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
to worry about that so the the neat
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
people that you're are seeing that
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
number our people excluding the five P
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
five people that could come in today if
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
we could provide the beds and we just
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
can't provide the bed safely we can't
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
meet the needs and make our regulatory
 
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
needs uh for the VA or our commitment to
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
those to those veterans that are there
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
so 131 is the cap where we said we can
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
we can do this to 131 and that's looking
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
at each unit and our staffing for each
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
unit and today we're at 129 with pending
 
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.289 align:start position:0%
unit and today we're at 129 with pending
admissions

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:27.419 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just going through here to see
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
if there are slides that sort of give us
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
all the number I wanted to really
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
emphasize is that our the 131 is
 
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
matching up with our 51 vacancy rate
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
with nurses and 45 with lnas and I think
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
it's lower with lnas because we have the
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
program that we can create in lnas right
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you remember the
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
history on this were you were you
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
employed at the veterans swim two three
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
years ago I was not I was at glencliffe
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay so so so you might have heard that
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
what the previous division three did was
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
we took the governor's recommendation
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
and basically approved it so so I'm uh
 
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
to the to what extent do you have some
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
unusual budget requests that might jump
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
out at us as something we need to be
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
aware of because I think in the past
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
we've been generally supportive of your
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
mission and your resourcing yes so I
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
think um if I were if I were in your
 
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.100 align:start position:0%
shoes I'd be looking at Big differences
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
and what I would probably bring your
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
attention to uh mostly is around
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
um our consultant fees we had a doctor
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
who was with us for many many years
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and business on a particular page
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
looking at the actual budget the budget
 
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.130 align:start position:0%
looking at the actual budget the budget
so

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
yes and this is under 53.59 you'll see
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
our contracted Services have gone up and
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's due to us having a contract out
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
for our medical providers and and we
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
that contract will expire during this
 
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
time and so we are forecasting what we
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
think might happen without contract the
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
other cost which I think a lot of people
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
are experiencing is the increase in
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs and again we're
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
forecasting but we have
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
um we have veterans who come in we had
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
just had an admission recently where a
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
veteran is taking a Parkinson medication
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
then it can't be changed it's thirty six
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars each month so you'll
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
see a pretty big jump in the
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
prescription cost and that's again
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
forecasted we don't know who our new
 
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
admissions will be and what kind of
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
medications but that's what we're
 
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
forecasting out to see that we might
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
need uh the the extra funds for
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
other than that I think it's we stayed
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
within the governor's parameters
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a yeah I'm
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
just looking at the numbers
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
um online zero six zero under
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
benefits I hope I'm looking at the right
 
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.750 align:start position:0%
benefits I hope I'm looking at the right
line

00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
um it went from 6.4 million in 2022 up
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
to 10.4
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
and then it stays at like that 10
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
million number
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
um is that online page 1097
 
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.570 align:start position:0%
um is that online page 1097
1097.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
1097.
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
under Professional Care line zero six
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
zero I'm just curious if you knew what
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
caused that big jump there
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
in that line those would be our um is
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
that our overtime line is that what
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
benefits we we don't have so when we
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
have more overtime it has more benefits
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a lot of control over
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
those lines honestly those are set
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
um by the Personnel what the benefit
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
costs are to us so
 
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.049 align:start position:0%
costs are to us so
[Music]

00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:46.370 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:49.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
and now we're asking for nine million
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
eight and ten million three I was just
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
curious what fault I'm sorry yes yes
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
fell under that line item that had the
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
increase of four million dollars in the
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
last biennium do you have that answer
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
that would just be because every all the
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
all the um overtime pay and
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
um that'll increase as we go and every
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
year I've had to do adjustments into it
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we increased it
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry and I'm looking up at the
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
top at overtime line where it was 1.1
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
and then it dropped down so I see there
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
was a bit of a shift there so yeah okay
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
instead of having to come back and ask
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
for that to be in the correct line it's
 
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
in the correct line now thank you
 
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.710 align:start position:0%
in the correct line now thank you
yeah

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
so so one of the things that I think
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
you've done that addressed uh some
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
family uh concerns that I had heard over
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
the last few years was
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
um that you you really only had the one
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi network that supported the staff
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
primarily and that there was some
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
sharing from some of the patients of
 
00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
that but that was extremely limited I
 
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
understand that you've now got two
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
separate Wi-Fi systems so that patients
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
can now or residents whatever the right
 
00:24:11.169 --> 00:24:11.179 align:start position:0%
term is are now able to enjoy as much
 
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
bandwidth as they need to to movies
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
communicate with their family do email
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff yes sir is that is
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
that project completed no so that's part
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
um uh Peggy lebrick was able to get that
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
in place but we were also able to ask
 
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:28.940 align:start position:0%
for Abra funds because of our building
 
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
its Wi-Fi is not completely steady
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole building so you
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
have to be in certain areas to be able
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
to access it so we have got a 1.1
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars to invest in our Wi-Fi
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
system as well as our communication
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
boards and Conference so we have an IT
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
project underway and that the improve
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
the goal is to improve the communication
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
for the residents so they can
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
communicate with their families no
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
matter where they are we don't have to
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
go to a certain area or know which rooms
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
are the best rooms so if you have
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to use their computer
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
a lot that's the best room for them to
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
have as a resident room so and so could
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
you summarize some of the covet
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
restrictions that might still be in
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
place are you still requiring masks for
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
everyone are you still requiring the
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
injection for every employee and for
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
every patient what talk just generally
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
about code so our covid right now we are
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
currently actually in a coveted outbreak
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
we have been since December because
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
every time somebody gets coveted
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
prolongs it you have to have two full
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
weeks of clean testing with no positives
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
Friday will be our last clean test
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
hopefully and we'll be off but we
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
haven't had any veterans have coveted
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
since uh January 31st so it's all been
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
staffed just kind of the stuff
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
with that said though when you're in
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
outbreak we actually do we still wear
 
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.149 align:start position:0%
outbreak we actually do we still wear
goggles

00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
goggles
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and if we are in an outbreak with a
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
resident area the residents are staying
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
in their unit we have a quarantine unit
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
we wear PPE gowns gloves and 95 masks
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
but traditionally every day if we're not
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
an outbreak we are wearing the uh
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
surgical mask still with them
 
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
and so what's that doing to your
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
visitation policy
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it's changed anything
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
I think that the the family members of
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
the residents come in no matter what and
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
they'll wear whatever they need to to
 
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
see them we are opening up a little bit
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
more having visitors come in we have a
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
lot of veterans support organizations
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
that come in and do cookouts and those
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of outings and so we just have
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
under 10 and it's an example recently we
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
had the l a graduation they were able to
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
bring two people or three people this
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
one we did three people each family so
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're starting to slowly put
 
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.490 align:start position:0%
we're starting to slowly put
the

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:48.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
visits open a little bit more for the
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
residents and the families
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren anything
 
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
anything all right
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
they they
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
yes she always does a good job thank you
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you again I would love to extend
 
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
um an invitation to the facility if
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to come and tour and
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
see what we do
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
um pick out a room you know in the
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
future I want the one with the view you
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
want the one with it and internet those
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
are my two criteria and something with a
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
bathroom would be good oh private
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
bathroom is a little harder to come by
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
but we'll see what we can do yeah and
 
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
and where did your CFO deploy
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
um he is actually in Pembroke because
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
he's on the I don't know the term but
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
the back side he's on the he's a major
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
and he's supporting the team that's on a
 
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
front line so he is actually in Pembroke
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
which was very convenient for me today
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
so his rough duty is Pembroke I know
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
right don't say that to him all right
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
we'll just say deployed all right
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
um all right well thank you so much
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
I think that answers everything okay
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
how about
 
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
are there any preferences out in the
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
audience there and I see the
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
commissioner is entered do you want to
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
say anything to us or are you just like
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
watching or
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you oh are you which one's your
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
topic ma'am
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
why don't you go come up and we'll let
 
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
it may be surprising that I'm going to
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
speak to you about facilities but I will
 
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
explain why
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
I know my staff have done a fantastic
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
job of uh coming and presenting to you
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
all of our our programs facilities is a
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
little bit uh different
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
um as many of you know I was Deputy
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
Commissioner prior to this role that I'm
 
00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
in now and Facilities was in my
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
portfolio and has been for quite some
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
time we have had a significant amount of
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
turnover in facilities between admin
 
00:29:35.049 --> 00:29:35.059 align:start position:0%
services and HHS so when we think about
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge walking out the
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
door it did walk out the door I mean
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
people were retiring it's not that it
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
was a horrible place to be it was really
 
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419 align:start position:0%
about after covid many people took early
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
retirement or retired so we're in a
 
00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:49.250 align:start position:0%
retirement or retired so we're in a
position

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.149 align:start position:0%
position
um

00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
where some of that has happened so I
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
have hired a facilities director who I
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
have here with me today but this is um
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
this isn't she Tammy's in her first year
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
Tammy Nelson is our facilities director
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
so what I wanted to share with you is
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
the last budget cycle there was a change
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
to how facilities would be
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
taken care of for Health and Human
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
Services so many people may or may not
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
know but in 2005 we had an agreement
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
with Department of admin services and
 
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
health and human services for how they
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
would take care of our property so we
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
have quite a bit of space we have the
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
State Office Park South Campus we have
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
the Hazen Drive campus we have our 24 7
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
institutions we have 11 district offices
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
we have 26 leases
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
which the 11 offices are part of that
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
but we also have itinerant offices so as
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
you can imagine that's a lot of people a
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
lot of square footage a lot of
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
facilities work Das was uh always uh we
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
had an mou where we had 38 distinct
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
items that they would be or activities
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
that they would be helping us with last
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
budget cycle that was a change Das was
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
to centralize their services so that
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
moving to a cost allocation model that
 
00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
they would be providing services to any
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
Agency on Sops campus which makes sense
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
from their perspective but for us it's a
 
00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
little bit of a hit because we now don't
 
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:24.059 align:start position:0%
have some of those extra sets of hands
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
if you will to to deal with the enormity
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
of some of our needs so
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
our presentation today is a lot focused
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
on a lot of it's focused on that what's
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
going to be different for the department
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
and the next biennium is really building
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
up a little bit of our own
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we have the way
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
we've always broken it out is that
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
patient buildings
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
were always the responsibility of HHS so
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
when you think about New Hampshire
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
hospital it's on the grounds so Das
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
takes care of the snow plowing they take
 
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
care of the flowers and the grass and
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
all of those things but they take care
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
of nothing inside so when we had a water
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
break there when we had that cold snap a
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago and it flooded we
 
00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
HHS take care of that not Das whereas
 
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
when the flooding happened in one of our
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
district offices that was a lease space
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
we have a landlord and working with us
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
on Claremont we had two district offices
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
have water leaks or so we had four
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
events in three days it was quite an
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
event for us so point being is that
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have the help sometimes we
 
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
don't so we need to build that into our
 
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
system so our facilities
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
you know I think we have here you know
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
26 leases 325 000 square footage
 
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
approximately 228
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
about about thereabouts is for the
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
district offices so you get a sense for
 
00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:46.730 align:start position:0%
district offices so you get a sense for
that

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
if you flip to slide three I did want to
 
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
invite Tammy to be able to share a
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
little bit and have a little bit of a
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
presentation in terms of what she's
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
tasked with with doing so we're sharing
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Tammy Nelson
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
director of facilities thank you for
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
having me
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
as Lori mentioned
 
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:13.909 align:start position:0%
as Lori mentioned
um

00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
we oversee and manage 26 lease
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
facilities and how we do that really is
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
broken down into two areas of designated
 
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.289 align:start position:0%
broken down into two areas of designated
Focus

00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
Focus
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
one is facilities maintenance which
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
consists of the overall management of
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
lease space in order to service the
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
do you want me to back up okay
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
so with facilities maintenance we are
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
responsible essentially to procure
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
design in a reconfigure office space to
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
meet the operational needs of the
 
00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:53.810 align:start position:0%
meet the operational needs of the
department

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
to ensure safety and accessibility of
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
HHS facilities and to ensure the
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
facilities are maintained properly
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
we have at this time four full-time
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
facility coordinators who manage all
 
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.730 align:start position:0%

offices
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
secondly we have office services which
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
provides support functions to all the
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
HHS locations Statewide those Services
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
include mail purchasing inventory And
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
in addition to the field locations as
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner mentioned the bureau
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
provides oversight in management of the
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
Services Center
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
150 acres 13 buildings
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
of those 13 buildings
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
how many of them are really actively
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
used by the sununu youth center right I
 
00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:36.500 align:start position:0%
know there's one huge complex
 
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.050 align:start position:0%
know there's one huge complex
where

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:38.060 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
hallways connect everything I assume
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
that counts as one building but I don't
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
know but then also there are kind of
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
like historic buildings or buildings
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
that need to be torn down are how do
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
they figure in that count
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
well they we own the property so we're
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
responsible to maintain it right so Das
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
helps us maintain it
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
um the the youth are in the new the
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
newer building it's not new anymore we
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
have a building called the
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
administration building which might be
 
00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
the building that you're thinking about
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if that counts as
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
wanters too but we do use that the staff
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
use that so we may not have youth in
 
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
there but we have staff in there the
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
State Police use one of the buildings
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
for its state police right for the horse
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh equestrian there's some training
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
there but then we have buildings you'll
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
see one of our capital projects was to
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
demolish Wilkins building so even though
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
it may not be in useful responsible for
 
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
making sure that it's a safe environment
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
and if it needs to come down it comes
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
down we have the where the boiler is
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
that supports the property the roof is
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
done and falling in so we have to make
 
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
plans for that because that boiler
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
supports the property so they're
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
intertwined but youth aren't in any of
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
the other buildings right which is kind
 
00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:55.940 align:start position:0%
of the point I wanted to Elevate is that
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the cost of the
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
sununu youth center
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of this entire real property
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
gets to be allocated to the sununu youth
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
center which in my view overstates the
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
cost of current operations
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
is a fair I mean like for example the
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
equestrian center for the State Police
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
is do they reimburse you a fair price
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
for that or or is that something the
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
sununu youth center is uh subsidizing or
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
funding yeah I think it's an in-kind we
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
let them use it in kinds like we have
 
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
we don't exchange money on it uh board
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
that for that particular piece of it and
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know what their utilization is I
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
know they're using it for storage I mean
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's not heated uh I shouldn't say it's
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
not heated I don't it's it's
 
00:37:47.339 --> 00:37:48.890 align:start position:0%
not heated I don't it's it's
um

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's not like any of the other
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
facilities where it's it's um
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's a barn
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
right it's a barn and a rodeo pen and a
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
bunch of others and then they're like
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
three old buildings when you pull all
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
the way in that are brick off to the you
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
know and so my my maybe this is a Mr
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
White question if we were to put a cost
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
estimate on all of that land and and
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
property or buildings
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh how how big a number are we talking
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
about that isn't directly related to
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
taking care of our juvenile mission
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
when you say cost estimate are are you
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
talking about like what what on what
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
costs are not directly related to the
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
operations associated with the children
 
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
that are there is is that what you're
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
indicating that that's where I'm going
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
like like when you when you pull all the
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
way through in the in the in the main
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
entrance and and there's the the two or
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
three brick buildings in the on the
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
short Horizon with this new new center
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
to your left those buildings are not
 
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
being used to support the ju the sununu
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
youth center mission
 
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to know
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
how much a fair cost estimate would be
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
of all that extra property that gets
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
hung around the neck of this Nunu Center
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
when it's really a cost allocation issue
 
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:20.660 align:start position:0%
that you guys are eating for other
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
departments and other uses does that
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
make the question more clear or more
 
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
complex no that's clear I I think I'd
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
have to go back and take a closer look
 
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:32.339 align:start position:0%
at a you know what what we have in the
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
syc uh operating account what do we have
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
here what are the sort of uh
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
non-denomenal non-denominational in-kind
 
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
matches that we have today to come up
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
with an accurate figure for you okay so
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
why is this relevant it's not just an
 
00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
academic issue it's relevant to me
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
because at some point I have a dream and
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
in this dream there's a new sununu or
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
whatever that we're going to call it a
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
replacement facility for the current
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
sununu Center and and this new new
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
Mission will the youth center Mission
 
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:07.220 align:start position:0%
will no longer be on that campus
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
yet the state will still have ongoing
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
cost obligations for that campus it just
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
won't go under this Nunu expense lines
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious when it's all said
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
and done what are we going to be left
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
with after the replacement Center has
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
been opened and what line of accounting
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
will be used
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
in the future to to pay for the required
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance the demolition the mowing
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
the lawn you know all of that stuff
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about the longer term
 
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:47.150 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about the longer term
View

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
your term view is on and there has been
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
desire expressed by the governor to sell
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
the property
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I think if we move our services out
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
of there HHS I mean Das would assume
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
that that responsibility for maintaining
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
that campus just as they do for any
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
other state property as long as the
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
state owns it
 
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:06.740 align:start position:0%
okay so rather than
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
DHHS riding the check Das will write the
 
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.670 align:start position:0%
DHHS riding the check Das will write the
check

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
it the state isn't saving money and it's
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
just changing who pays for it and so I'm
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
I just would like us to be able to
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
anticipate what that that amount of
 
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
money will end up being because although
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
we have said that we'd like to sell it
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
we said we wanted to sell Laconia right
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
and that took a decade or more so so I'm
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious what the long-term Tale
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
on this property is going to be I think
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
representative hole you had a question
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
it may I I think Jess needs to be a part
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
of that conversation as well because the
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
minute we vacate that property they
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
become responsible for that property so
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
I imagine that they have their own
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
Protocols of what they need to do if
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
that property is no longer going to be
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
utilized they have a protocol that they
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
follow where they're shutting down
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
building and and winterizing it or
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
taking it out of use so they would be
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
better able to project what those costs
 
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay I'll maybe next budget cycle if I'm
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
here we'll ask Das what that estimate is
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
but it feels to me like it's got to be a
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
couple million dollars a year that's
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
generally what I'm feeling from this I
 
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's reasonable
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
do you have any reason to think that's
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
not reasonable the building
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's really yeah it's
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
all right well now it's Houston
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
speculating I guess representable thank
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
you along the same line right some of
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
those buildings for instance the state
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
police using the oldest brick or the old
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
brick building just south of of the
 
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:44.579 align:start position:0%
training and writing and exercise arena
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
for the equestrian
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
portion of their whatever the state
 
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.270 align:start position:0%
portion of their whatever the state
police

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
how many of those buildings are heated
 
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
not heated and right how many are cold
 
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
storage how many could be mothballed not
 
00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
right because some buildings you don't
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
want to just winterize if you winterize
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
the building it quickly falls into
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
disrepair and is no longer usable so if
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
you guys have any insight or maybe
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
someone who is more Hands-On within the
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
oversight of that those buildings yeah I
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
mean we can get you that information for
 
00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.089 align:start position:0%
mean we can get you that information for
sure

00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
some of them are no longer or they are
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
mothballed some of them
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
are we good to proceed
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
I'm still curious about that I I guess
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just jumping around exposing my ADD
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
again but
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
um I in the missions here I don't really
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
see who's accountable or where the
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
function of Space Management is so that
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
in my in my terminology this was
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually a job additional duty I had
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
where you know all of the office space
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
and and clinical space of a of a couple
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
hospitals I was responsible for
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
allocating the space to various units
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
and so I imagine with all of this all
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
these facilities somebody's doing a
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
similar function of knowing what's
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
available who's where and and and it
 
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
gets to the point of saying okay this is
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
this is our picture we have a
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
significant vacancy problem and so some
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
of that space is underused now because
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
we have vacancies we're trying to fill
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
but but then it gets to the real
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
management question I think of are we
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
sitting on excess capacity are we do we
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
know whether or not we have good active
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
management of the space is it possible
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
releasing space that we could actually
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
solve those requirements in-house and
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
those those kinds of questions I'd like
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
to know about the management and to the
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
extent to which those kinds of
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
management questions have been asked
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years so we know
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
that we're doing a fine job in that
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
regard sure so if you're at a flip to
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
Slide Five
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
there's an org chart here and I have a
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
yellow box around the left side of that
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
so that was our mou that we had with Das
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
so in Partnership our facilities
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
director with uh with position and Das
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
would do the Space Management so in
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
terms of if I have new staff coming on
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
board you know or the directors do we
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
let facilities know Tammy Tammy has like
 
00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
the master macro view of where do we
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
have space I will tell you that I mean I
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
was out in three district offices last
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
week I'll be out in Claremont this
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
Friday and our officers are packed they
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
were packed before the pandemic during
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we worked remotely and then
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
people are coming back a lot of our
 
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
business uh it's hard for us to be 100
 
00:45:59.569 --> 00:45:59.579 align:start position:0%
remote and I don't think we'll we will
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
ever be but we are like a hybrid right
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
so we have we have staff that interface
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
with clients every single day but they
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
need a home base to come to and they
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
need a team so that office is really
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
important so I was just you know
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
Rochester's in the middle of a
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
renovation with the city there's they're
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
they're just squeaking in there we're
 
00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:21.740 align:start position:0%
squished into Keen we're squished into
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh not Portsmouth but what was Laconia
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're falling out Laconia so there's
 
00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
just there's not there's there seems to
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
be sometimes an assumption that maybe we
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
have more square footage that we need
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
when I go on the road boots on the
 
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
ground that's not the case I have I have
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
people sharing cubicles and offices so
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
we used to have 12 district offices we
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
now have 11. so we we did this exercise
 
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
in the past and and it's really hard of
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
which office do you close right because
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
you know they're all scattered
 
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and the minute you
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
close an office you make it harder for
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
clients to get to your services so
 
00:46:59.569 --> 00:46:59.579 align:start position:0%
having 11 it's been hard to get below
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
11. now I will tell you in Claremont
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at you know are there ways
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
that we can make do something different
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
with that office so when the opportunity
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
presents itself we're taking it so Lisa
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
the lease for Laconia is coming up we're
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
looking at that as well and we're not
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
looking at it a couple months ahead
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it months out but
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's just challenges to how we do our
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
business and landlords that are willing
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
to work with us so you could in terms of
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
management that's something that we're
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
always paying attention to and then the
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
other part of that sort of the Strategic
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
realignment in the post-pandemic world
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
is that uh generally we're probably more
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
open to some remote support but what I
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
think I just heard you say is that
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's also being actively considered uh
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
and and that the potential for that is a
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
little bit limited because you're such a
 
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
client based face-to-face organization
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
correct and when we have vacancies like
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
we do we have new staff coming on they
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
need to be trained they need to be with
 
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
other people right I don't know how you
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
build your culture like you've said you
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
want to without people being near each
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
other I don't know how you do that in a
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
virtual world so so again we're not 100
 
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
virtual we have the flexibility to be
 
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
able to have the hybrid so like I said
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
when I go out staff are telling me that
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
they want to be together they like the
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
flexibility but it's important to teams
 
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:22.849 align:start position:0%
flexibility but it's important to teams
so

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to jump ahead to six where
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
you have facility positions requests
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and and let's say that these these
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh these positions uh make sense the so
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
um is is not to ask you to justify these
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
because what I think I heard you say is
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
the realignment of the mou with Das has
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
caused you to to need these positions
 
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
internally instead of relying on Das
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
services so because of that I wonder if
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
this actually should be some sort of a
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
funds transfer from a Das budget to you
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's a funds transfer as
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
much as is we don't pay them as much as
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
what we used to pay them I'll let Nathan
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
answer that sure so if you turn
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
um 1087 of the governor's recommended
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
budget you look at class 28 transfer to
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
plant and property
 
00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:20.579 align:start position:0%
um the the amount that that we have
 
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
budgeted in that line this year uh it it
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
went down significantly
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
um we did have uh representative Hull
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
had a question when we were presenting
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
on uh the Department of Public Health
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
Services because there was also that
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
transfer to plant and property for das
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
there where we saw roughly 500 000
 
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
increase but but even if if you take
 
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:44.540 align:start position:0%
that that class 28 from from account
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
5110 within public health and you look
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
at the amount that we have here in
 
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
account 5685 for the class is 28. we I
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
mean we we are we are seeing a net
 
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
decrease there so I I mean one a prudent
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
person could argue that there would be
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds to to cover these these
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
potential costs associated with these
 
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.490 align:start position:0%
potential costs associated with these
positions

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.950 align:start position:0%
positions
yeah

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions at this point
 
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.270 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions at this point
um

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna let you come
 
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
back and back clean up after I just jump
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
around a little bit may I just add one
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
piece though representative to the
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
position part I just want to point out
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for three I think I had seven
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
from from Das so we're not asking to
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
replace the whole thing we're just
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
basically looked at out of those
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
functions that we had uh with uh Das
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
what are the ones that that are no
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
longer going to be able to be given to
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
us to the extent that they were like if
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
you take at least the least position
 
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
that isn't just I process the leases
 
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's day-to-day lease management and
 
00:50:49.809 --> 00:50:49.819 align:start position:0%
with 26 properties you can imagine
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that happens with that and
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
then the two maintenance mechanics so I
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
just want to point out I'm not asking to
 
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
get everything that they had given I'm
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
asking for these critical positions to
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
add to Tammy's uh Bureau right and since
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
you can't read my mind I I would tell
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
you that I am less concerned about your
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
request as I am just making sure that by
 
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
moving things from Das to your
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
department that we're not leaving Das as
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
fully resourced as they had been and
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
were growing government through the back
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
door I don't I don't doubt your request
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
your need for the request I'm I'm more
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
concerned that the money transfers are
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
in place and the understandings are in
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
place so we're not leaving Das with less
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
Mission and still the same number of
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
people that that wouldn't make sense to
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
me sure and I would just also share that
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner only house and team in our
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
teams we met last Friday so they're
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're well aware of we've had this
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
conversation about impact and moving
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
forward so I just want to put that out
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
there in terms of this is this is
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
something we've been working on together
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and then I'm I'm
 
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
jumping to nine on on bullet five where
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
you have district offices and client and
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
Concord and so this this is explicitly
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
not the New Hampshire hospital for
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
example this is this is really the stuff
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
up on Hazen right
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
um no this is not even Hazen this is
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
district offices so this is where we
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
provide the direct client services so I
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
we we just kept it for the D what we
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
call the Dos but if we were to add we
 
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
would add Hampstead we would add
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
glencliffe we would add all of the
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
others we didn't this was just to say
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
these are the least spaces that we have
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
some of them okay so of these 11 I I've
 
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
heard you voice a concern that things
 
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
are fairly tight and many of them
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
um do you when do you imagine or do you
 
00:52:55.079 --> 00:52:56.270 align:start position:0%
um do you when do you imagine or do you
imagine

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
wanting to uh affirmatively acquire
 
00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:02.780 align:start position:0%
additional Space by
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
expanding the building somehow or or
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
what what what sort of as you look at I
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
I know you're you're you're you're think
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
you're focused on this year but if you
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
were to be thinking four or five years
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
out where do you see uh the longer term
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
facility need
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
so I'm not thinking about expanding I'm
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
thinking about doing it differently so
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
if we if let's just take Claremont for
 
00:53:27.839 --> 00:53:28.970 align:start position:0%
if we if let's just take Claremont for
example

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
um it's hard we've been trying to move
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
out of Claremont for seven years seven
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
years I can't find a landlord that can
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
match square footage for square footage
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
so now I'm at a spot where I say well do
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
I need to do that can I can I do that
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
business differently I still need to
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
have a client facing Lobby I still need
 
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
to have a back office for staff but do I
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
have to have it all stuck together like
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
I normally do and now I have a thing
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
called remote where I have some
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
flexibility with seats right so that's
 
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339 align:start position:0%
what I'm playing with right now so I
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
want to sort of pilot what we're going
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
to do potentially with let's just I'll
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
pick on Claremont it may not be
 
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
Claremont but if we're able to stand up
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
and and meet our business needs and
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
doing it differently than it looked like
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
and it helps us with square footage and
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
Lease space and then that's what we
 
00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
and um just just following up on
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative walner's request from
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
yesterday there there is an hb2
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
provision it's section 241 of hb2 and it
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
could you state the request and so we
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
understand your answer sure I apologize
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
um so yesterday as we were discussing
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner asked us as we go
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
through our presentations if there is an
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
applicable hb2 provision that that we
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
just draw attention to that so we see
 
00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
the connections once we start to go
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
through hb2
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
um and so section 241 of hb2 that there
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
was a 533 thousand dollar appropriation
 
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:00.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for um
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
doing that and the other thing I was
 
00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
wanting to do before you leave is maybe
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
talk about whether you had any
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that were not
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
addressed in the governor's
 
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:18.950 align:start position:0%
addressed in the governor's
budgets

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
for facilities
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
for facilities
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I think I've had it in the last
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
couple of budgets to try to move
 
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:36.059 align:start position:0%
district offices which I've told you
 
00:55:37.609 --> 00:55:37.619 align:start position:0%
it's taken me seven years to find for
 
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
Claremont but we did have two we had
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
money in there for two moves
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner and we got we got
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
the one of them
 
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.250 align:start position:0%
the one of them
um

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
and can I just ask where the other one
 
00:55:48.119 --> 00:55:49.309 align:start position:0%
and can I just ask where the other one
was

00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
amount or location both
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
Nathan we have to tell you the amount
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
but I could tell you the location would
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
be Laconia because we don't we don't fit
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
into that space anymore
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
it would need a re-haul
 
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay so I've completely jumbled go ahead
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
he's got the amount that we we had made
 
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
two separate requests um four or five
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
hundred and uh thirty three thousand
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
dollars for each year
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
um but we were provided one
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation for that amount from the
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
23 Surplus oh she was the same amount
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
um representative Stringham yes so just
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
in the uh this is the 5685 category
 
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.569 align:start position:0%
in the uh this is the 5685 category
right

00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and cross-referencing the other
 
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
document with those three three staff
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
that you requested anywhere in the
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
budget or would that be something
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
supplemental that you'd be uh asking us
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
to fund no so so this this was not
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
included in our original agency budget
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
um I was doing my role at the time Tammy
 
00:56:59.569 --> 00:56:59.579 align:start position:0%
was new in her role at the time and we
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
were really kind of taking this in it's
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
been a it's been a more recent analysis
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
and discussion with the Department of
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
administrative services to understand
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
the full implications of of what the the
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
prior hb2 language did when it struck
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
down that mou law from 2005. thank you
 
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:15.109 align:start position:0%
down that mou law from 2005. thank you
oh

00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
um and follow different questions are
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
about six facilities whose leases runs
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
runs out during this biennium how long
 
00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
do these releases generally run and uh
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
you know what do what do you anticipate
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of um you know rate change from
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
our leases typically Run 10 years but in
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
terms of rate changes I'm not really
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
sure I mean we we've been pretty good
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
so my predecessors have worked um very
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
hard to ensure that we've had full gross
 
00:57:54.119 --> 00:57:55.670 align:start position:0%
hard to ensure that we've had full gross
leases

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
leases
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
um we have one that's an exception and
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
the three I think that are coming up in
 
00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.650 align:start position:0%
the three I think that are coming up in
this

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
three that I think you mentioned we have
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
already started discussions with them
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm not expecting anything of great
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
significance for a rate change I I think
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
you used the term I'm not familiar with
 
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:20.180 align:start position:0%
did you say full growth full growth
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
g-r-o-s-s yes what is a full growth what
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
that means is
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
um essentially we pay a fixed rate
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
um and we that assumes all operating
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
costs of the building owner or landlord
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't pay utilities separately
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
janitorial separately you know it's all
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
inclusive and again we have one
 
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
and which one is that
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
that would be Manchester okay
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead and represent hole
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity on full growth
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
right so these would not be taxable
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
properties correct so in the traditional
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a net net net type lease or is
 
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.809 align:start position:0%
it's not a net net net type lease or is
it

00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
Nathan I don't understand that
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I follow your question
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
are we being taxed or is the land owner
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
have a landlord being on leased property
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
is the landlord being taxed my
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is yes that the state has
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
an exemption where any state property
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
does not pay any any local property
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
taxes but I'm not aware of any exemption
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions so so I'm
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
going to just apologize see I jumped all
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
over through this thing and and you you
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
know it's because this is your first
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
budget briefing uh you probably were
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
really madly prepared to go through
 
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
stuff and I've ruined that for you so if
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
there's anything that you want to come
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
back and tell us that we didn't talk
 
00:59:58.970 --> 00:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
about I'm all ears we're all ears
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think we've covered covered everything
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
um if there are you know any areas you
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
want us to dig into deeper we're happy
 
01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.730 align:start position:0%
want us to dig into deeper we're happy
to

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:10.460 align:start position:0%
okay we'll let you know thank you okay
 
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
all right well uh thank you uh very much
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
we may end up sending you some questions
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
via email in case they come up as we
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
look at this diet or more closely
 
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
so is there anyone in the audience I
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
should have asked this earlier that one
 
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:30.420 align:start position:0%

um there's others in the audience too
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
that if there's additional questions
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we need more help with then they
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
and um you have a number of documents
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
that that Kevin has handed out
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
um so you will see the the coloring book
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
I I really enjoy that phrase thank you
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%

um you also have the the budget briefing
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
book that that is associated with New
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
um there's also a position movement
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
detail this is similar to what we handed
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
out for the division for children youth
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
and families just to show how the
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
positions are moving or whether they're
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
being transferred and the New Hampshire
 
01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:10.930 align:start position:0%
being transferred and the New Hampshire
hospital

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:10.940 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
budget begins on page
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh 1056 of the governor's recommended
 
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.270 align:start position:0%
uh 1056 of the governor's recommended
budget

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
so all the things you just said I think
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
I'm tracking on all of them except for
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
the position reallocation sheet it it
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
should look like this yellow blue yeah
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.220 --> 01:03:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
there we go I was going to start with
 
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital and then discuss
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
path and then discuss Glenn Cliff if
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's comfortable with the committee
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
okay so the coloring book I think is
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
what Nathan just alluded to the slide
 
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
deck for New Hampshire hospital you'll
 
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.270 align:start position:0%
deck for New Hampshire hospital you'll
see

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
um on slide three that is our mission
 
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
and vision statement I don't want to go
 
01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
through that in great detail but if
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's any questions please feel free
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
to let me know on slide four it tells
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of history of New
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital many of you may be
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
familiar with this but New Hampshire
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
hospital provides acute inpatient
 
01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:41.299 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Services to Citizens
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
experiencing severe and persistent
 
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
mental illness Ms Lapointe I we we
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
talked to you before the budget numbers
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
were released right and one of the
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
reasons we try to do that is so that we
 
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.530 align:start position:0%
reasons we try to do that is so that we
could

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.250 align:start position:0%
could
um

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
hone in more sure yeah so so I'm I'm all
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
I'm also saying that to whoever's
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
watching why we can fast forward through
 
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
some of this is because we did our
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
homework before the budget got released
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
that sounds great
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
so in terms of New Hampshire Hospital's
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
scope of services I wanted to make a
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
point to let the committee know New
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital does provide
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
geriatric inpatient Psychiatry forensic
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
inpatient Psychiatry we treat adults and
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
we also can treat medical comorbid
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
conditions we do not primarily treat
 
01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:34.460 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
disorders we don't treat acute Medical
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
Services we partner with hospitals to be
 
01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
able to provide that service we also
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't provide diagnostic services and of
 
01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
course we don't provide outpatient
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
services I think we have the first
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Hall
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
sure I'm jumping ahead great I'm
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
following after my chair I guess so when
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
we get to slide nine okay right can we
 
01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
cover vacancy rates in those positions
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
as well sure so I do have some vacancy
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
information that's specific to clinical
 
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
positions in front of me
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
um that would be our biggest
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities at this point from a New
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital perspective that
 
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
would be speaking to RN's mental health
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
workers and social services from a RN
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
standpoint we have a 39 vacancy rate
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
from a mental health worker standpoint
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
we have a 30 vacancy rate and from a
 
01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:30.980 align:start position:0%
social work standpoint we have a 60
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
 
01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.030 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
follow-up

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
so if I look at position page nine right
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
is it possible that you can provide to
 
01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
is it possible that you can provide to
us

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
or give to us now
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
sorry can you provide to us now or or
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
later right of those recommended
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
positions how many of those are
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
currently filled and not filled and then
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
the net direct effect on how many
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
additional patients could be
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
treated sure yes I'm happy to provide
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
you with that information as a follow-up
 
01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
I will add
 
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
um from a census perspective at New
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital our current capacity
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
is approximately 154 patients I say
 
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
approximately because there are times
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
where we have to fluctuate for private
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
rooms versus semi-private rooms
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
depending on patient needs we are at
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
full capacity at this point at at that
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
Benchmark the highest capacity that we
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
have ever had at New Hampshire hospital
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
is right around 184 187 and at this
 
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
point in time our vacancy rates are are
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
directly impacting our ability to
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
increase our senses I will also add that
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
based on what the commissioner was just
 
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
speaking about earlier from a water
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
damage perspective the two units that
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
are currently vacant at New Hampshire
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
hospital that makes up that variance of
 
01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
beds that I just discussed were the
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
units that were impacted by water damage
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
and are currently in no shape to be able
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
to have patients occupy them
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
so let me reiterate what I just heard
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
which is there's both a facility issue
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
as well as a vacancy rate that is
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
prohibiting additional patients there
 
01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.250 align:start position:0%
prohibiting additional patients there
correct

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
What's the timing on the repair of the
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
facility and what's the plan
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so great question so at this point in
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
time as of
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
um probably yesterday between yesterday
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
and today we've just barely completed
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
the demolition of the space that we
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
needed to accomplish due to the water
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
damage we're at a point where we're
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
pursuing contracts or estimates for the
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
repair of the space however it's also at
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
the same time frame of our hopes to be
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
able to renovate our enf unit which are
 
01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
the impacted units you may remember that
 
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire hospital had youth
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
they were on the enf units and it's been
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
several years in an attempt to try to
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
renovate those units to be able to get
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
them to more of an adult standard and
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
environment so that renovation project
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
actually has gone out or will be about
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
to go out to bid and we're hopeful to be
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
able to to pursue that unit-based
 
01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:13.309 align:start position:0%
able to to pursue that unit-based
renovation

01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:16.699 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
so because you're talking about
 
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.789 align:start position:0%
so because you're talking about
renovation

01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
um are is this to bring uh the facility
 
01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:26.179 align:start position:0%
in line with with um relatively recent
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
jcho standards is jcho one of the
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
benchmarks you try to meet and and how
 
01:08:35.329 --> 01:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
are we doing from that perspective thank
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
you for that question so yes
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
um we are accredited by The Joint
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
Commission we had our last survey in
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
September of 2021
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
um so our cert they uh survey on a
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
three-year basis so we do anticipate in
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
the next year or so seeing them again at
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital and yes there are
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
several regulations affiliated with the
 
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
environment which are definitely being
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration during the enf
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
renovation project
 
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
um you know without going into detail
 
01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
about all of those different
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
requirements that was part of the
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
architectural and design process with
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
the firm that we partnered with to be
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
able to make sure that we met all those
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
requirements in terms of the hospital's
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
accreditation in general as I mentioned
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
we had our previous survey there were
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
opportunities for improvement but
 
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
nothing of immediate you know
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
significance or high level harm so we're
 
01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:36.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the number of individuals
 
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
served again I just want to be mindful
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
of of the specific information that
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
might be helpful for this committee so
 
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
you can see on slide eight for fiscal
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
year 22 we had just under a thousand
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
Admissions and um just under again a
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
thousand discharges so
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
um you know we're trying to maintain
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
that healthy balance of admitting folks
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
who need our level of care into the
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
environment as well as discharging them
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
into the community when they're ready I
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
would like to pay attention to
 
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
um slide 17 thank you Brett so um it's a
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's more of a summary page but when
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Admissions and
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
discharges one of the things that we
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
briefly discussed at the prep meeting a
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago
 
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
um was the
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
um the wait list of course the Ed
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
waitlist that is of significance and
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to continue to admit
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
patients into New Hampshire hospital to
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
address but we also have
 
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
um at the end there you'll see on any
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
given day approximately 50 of patients
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital are considered
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
non-certified meaning that they don't
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria for a billable stay
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
and could be better served in a less
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire hospital works very
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
hard but of course as barriers that you
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
have heard from several others regarding
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
the ability to discharge into the
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
community and having those
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
community-based services and housing
 
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
opportunities has been a challenge for
 
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
us and as we understand is a challenge
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
throughout the state as well
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
I I don't remember if you were here when
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
I talked about this but I take a look at
 
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:34.790 align:start position:0%
I talked about this but I take a look at
the

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
sort of the stakeholder
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
bubbles chart that what what number is
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
that my fingers are not parsingly as
 
01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
very well the all the stakeholders on
 
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
slide eight I believe population served
 
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
and and then and then when I when I'm
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
reading or listening to you talk about
 
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.110 align:start position:0%
reading or listening to you talk about
17

01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
17
 
01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking about is a is kind of
 
01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
a different graphic that this data would
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
support and that's with New Hampshire
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
hospital kind of in the middle
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
and then the inputs being the statistics
 
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
like the inpatient wait list growing the
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
adult emergency room boarding you know
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can better see over time what
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing to uh to influence both as a
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
society and as you directly and everyone
 
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
else in between
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
trying to manage that and then on the
 
01:12:37.209 --> 01:12:37.219 align:start position:0%
back end after New Hampshire hospital
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
all of the facilities where this 50
 
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:44.780 align:start position:0%
percent could go if they were available
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
because I I think I mentioned it to you
 
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
I maybe mentioned it to Mr Williams who
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
I don't see but but I I'm toying with
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
the idea that we ought to legislatively
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
change your mission statement to include
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
the explicit management and Reporting on
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
this this Ed to the community workflow
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
because there's no other organization in
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
the state it's better positioned to see
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
the whole problem and to provide maybe
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations and since that's not in
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
your mission statement
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
any Manpower or resources that you
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
allocate to that feels to me like it may
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
be borrowed and it's such a strategic
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
concern to the state I'm just wondering
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
if we need to do something
 
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
more substantive to better task you to
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
to to manage that and and so so what do
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
you think about that I I agree with you
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your you know your big
 
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
picture perspective in that regard I can
 
01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.189 align:start position:0%
picture perspective in that regard I can
say

01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
um you know without getting into a lot
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
of detail that I know that there's some
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
work being done that I've been able to
 
01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
participate in in DHHS similar to what
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're describing and trying to really
 
01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
have better
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
um oversight and
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
um you know systematic approach to the
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
system in its entirety as opposed to in
 
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
certain pieces
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and and I think you know we're on the
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
same page about needing to make sure
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
that that system is in place so that the
 
01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
throughput throughout the the mental
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
health system is solid and strong
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
because at this point there are
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
challenges that are real and there are
 
01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
patients that are in the middle of those
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
challenges that need our help so I
 
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so I wouldn't pretend
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
that by making you responsible for
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
creating this dashboard view of the
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
workflow the clinical flow that that
 
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
that that you would be expected to to
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
solve the problem but by having access
 
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
to the information and the mission to
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
advise on it that you that you could be
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
Central to the idea of coordinating
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations that that could be
 
01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:08.060 align:start position:0%
pursued because you know as a legislator
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
I I know I need the department to come
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
to me to tell me here's a proposal for
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
some legislation here's a problem this
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
is how we'd fix it and so I I don't know
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
if if you feel empowered or chartered
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
enough to to take that sort of
 
01:15:25.199 --> 01:15:27.790 align:start position:0%
enough to to take that sort of
initiative

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
and I would I would want you to or
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
somebody in the department to do that
 
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.050 align:start position:0%
somebody in the department to do that
comment

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.450 align:start position:0%
comment
oh

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
so Dr Han how are you
 
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
how am I doing am I being polite to
 
01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
everyone no you are you're taking all
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
the coaching very seriously
 
01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.229 align:start position:0%
the coaching very seriously
um

01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
um thank you Marissa hen associate
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner and um I just appreciate
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
this conversation and how Ellen's
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
framing things I think I would just add
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:15:58.729 --> 01:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
looking at the Ed boarding list is one
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
key indicator we look at every day and
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's available publicly and it's it's a
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
huge Focus right now that said it's um
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
it's an incomplete part of the picture
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
when we think about the ways in which
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
the uh or I should say it's it's
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
necessary but an insufficient part of
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
the data that we want to analyze and see
 
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
improvement with when we think about all
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
the changes that have happened with the
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
10-year Mental Health Plan and all
 
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
that's happening in terms of what Ellen
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
explained around how do we prevent
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
people from coming into our emergency
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
settings our inpatient settings in the
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
first place and then how do we make sure
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
they have a place to go which in turn
 
01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
becomes your new prevention there are an
 
01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
array of key data points that are
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
important to that so well I appreciate
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
the desire to engage in this policy
 
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
matter I think
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
um let us think a bit more about some of
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
the ways and share with you more updates
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
you'll also be hearing from Hampstead
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
Hospital which has some you know me seen
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
as well some really exciting progress
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
they'll report on today relative to this
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
full Continuum so I would urge that we
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
as a department take on the
 
01:16:59.930 --> 01:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility of analyzing and
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
responding to the data but I appreciate
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
the attention and the way that you're
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
trying to highlight our Dynamic
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility in that respect
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you for all that I I I I
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
guess at the end of the day I'm I'm
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
looking at it from my old military
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
mindset I want an individual accountable
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
for understanding the situation and uh
 
01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
for understanding the situation and uh
developing

01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
scenarios to to deal with it and and
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
right now my sense isn't is that if
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
there's any one accountable individual
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
just one the closest we come to it is is
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
probably the commissioner but I don't
 
01:17:42.169 --> 01:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
even think it's in her mission statement
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
to do this so so if we need to formalize
 
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
a statutory obligation to do this and
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
Empower an individual to oversee it and
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
coordinate it and communicate on it I
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be very open to that because I I
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
sort of feel like it's that big of a
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
problem and it's worth solving and and I
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
I would want to hear what how the
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
department would want to do that so far
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
I just look at NH the New Hampshire
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
hospital as sort of the the Cornerstone
 
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.910 align:start position:0%
hospital as sort of the the Cornerstone
to

01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
stuff on both ends and maybe a place to
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
start with possibility and the
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
possibility of pinning the rows on them
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
as being accountable for such a
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
situational awareness I'll use the term
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
well I wish the behavioral health system
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
was such that one entity could take full
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
accountability but the nature of the
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
work not unlike the dynamic military
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
challenges that you sometimes reference
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
in your own experience there are no
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
silver bullets or single entities that
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
have full responsibilities so it's it's
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
only through the collaborative
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
approaches that we're going to be able
 
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.030 align:start position:0%
approaches that we're going to be able
to

01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
create the positive change so so my
 
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
suggestion again would be let's take the
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
the charge you're giving us which is
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
what can we bring back as policy
 
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
opportunities as Financial opportunities
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
and share with you what the needs are
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
but um but I just would argue that a
 
01:19:11.209 --> 01:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
single point of data changed statutorily
 
01:19:11.219 --> 01:19:11.930 align:start position:0%
single point of data changed statutorily
is

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:12.470 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
could misdirect the focus to a sense
 
01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
that one entity has responsibility when
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
this is going to take the entire State
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
so you want to get back to wherever you
 
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
want to go sure so in terms of New
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital was there a question
 
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know if this is the
 
01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:39.020 align:start position:0%
right time but in terms of the
 
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
the forensic Hospital operations you had
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
a 42 million dollar request which was
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
zeroed out in the governor's budget and
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
um can you talk at all about how that
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
impacts uh
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
um you know achieving your mission you
 
01:19:58.610 --> 01:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
know what your thought is on on that
 
01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:00.659 align:start position:0%
particular item in the budget thank you
 
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
for that question and the forensic
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
hospital was exactly where I was going
 
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
to go next so I appreciate the timing in
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
terms of the operating budget and the
 
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
decision at the governor's phase I'm
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
actually entirely comfortable with it
 
01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
and the rationale behind that well not
 
01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
maybe not entirely comfortable but the
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
rationale behind that is because given
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
the information that we've received on
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that the construction
 
01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
of the forensic hospital is going to
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
take in the resource availability in the
 
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
current state of our country post you
 
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
know post covid
 
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
um is such that the amount of time
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to do the construction
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
we hope is going to fall directly in
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
line with the time frame in that we hope
 
01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to be operational of the
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
forensic Hospital in mid to late 2025.
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice to have a bit of wiggle
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
room but in terms of the the timing of
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
all of this we're actually a bit
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
appreciative from a New Hampshire
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
hospital perspective to have additional
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
time to operationalize the safety and
 
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah sure so so this would be
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
entirely new spending as an entirely out
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
of General funds and even if it affects
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
the biennium after this one
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
we we are anticipating that that it
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
would be a hundred percent General funds
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
um we we have looked for other funding
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
sources and will continue to do so
 
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and and as as Ellen indicated when we
 
01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
originally submitted our agency request
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh a number of months ago now
 
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
um we weren't aware of the of when the
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
construction would be finalized but with
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle um as Ellen was
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
was indicating that would give us enough
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
time to be able to get the budget
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
appropriated begin to hire staff begin
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
to train staff in advance of that
 
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
um and there there is an hb2 provision
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
in section 231 within hb2 and and that
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
that that that it it essentially makes
 
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
it very clear that um that the
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
department is unable to admit any
 
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
individuals to the forensic facility uh
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
during this biennium
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
um so but there's no there's no cost
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
associated with that particular
 
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.729 align:start position:0%
associated with that particular
provision

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
but but the clarity on that is the
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
current facility in which we're using
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
them as the secure forensic Hospital
 
01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be an operation
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
then still receiving patients you're
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
really talking about the new facility is
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
not going to be open but the current
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
methodology of managing these patients
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
will remain ongoing correct yes all
 
01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
right representative Waller I just
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to know have have we Broken
 
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
Ground on the on the facility no not yet
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
um we're so very close to sending out
 
01:22:51.169 --> 01:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
the request for proposal to bid for the
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
construction company and then of course
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
that has to follow through the process
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
and then get get approved once the
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
construction company is selected we hope
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to see that RFP go out in the
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
representative hole for a question how
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
big is that facility uh it's slated to
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
okay okay and the answer to proceed
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions specific
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire hospital if not I was
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to transition to the path program
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
looks good great thank you so I'll
 
01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
direct you to the slide deck that is
 
01:23:30.659 --> 01:23:32.030 align:start position:0%
direct you to the slide deck that is
indicated

01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
um for the path program path stands for
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
Philbrook adult transitional housing the
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
path program is approximately three
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
years old at this point so we're really
 
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
feeling very
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
um proud of the enhancements that
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
they've been able to make to the program
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
and and the stability and really
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
continuing to work on
 
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
um you know the transition of
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
individuals between New Hampshire
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
hospital and path it's a 16 bed program
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire hospital worked on
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
developing and opening a couple of years
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
ago and
 
01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
um at this point they have
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
um you know really one of the things
 
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
that is happening most currently is the
 
01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
um attempt to really kind of broaden
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
their scope of services to meet to best
 
01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the New Hampshire
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
hospital population
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
um so I'll direct you to slide six and
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
that talks about what path does and what
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
path does not do so you can see that
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
path does provide transitional housing
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
some medication supervision therapeutic
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
services intensive case management and
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
discharge planning and coordination with
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
the cmhcs or the Community Mental Health
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
Centers what they don't do is inpatient
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
care that's of course New Hampshire
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
hospital they also don't do involuntary
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
admissions diagnostic services acute
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of time I'll jump us
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
forward to slide
 
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
um nine and that talks about the number
 
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
of positions that path has across three
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
shifts there's 35 positions thankfully
 
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
um path has been able to maintain
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
relative stability in terms of their
 
01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
Staffing so that's been very helpful to
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
be able to continue the mission of that
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
program uh for the count I'm on slide 10
 
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
now for the calendar year ending in
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
December of 2022 you can see that path
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
had 21 Admissions and 33 discharges with
 
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
an average census of 14 patients I think
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
it's important to note the median length
 
01:25:45.729 --> 01:25:45.739 align:start position:0%
of stay was around 112 days that's high
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
but I think it also speaks to the
 
01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
challenges just as we've discussed
 
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
around New Hampshire hospital from a
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
discharge disposition perspective the
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
path Mission really is focused on
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
intense time management around getting
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
these folks discharged back into the
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
community and really helping them to
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
self-engage in what that process would
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
look like and helping provide them with
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
resources and transportation to be able
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
to see apartments and whatnot but really
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
that high length estate I think speaks
 
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
to the services and abilities in from a
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
community standpoint around allowing
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
these individuals to discharge back to
 
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
those locations representative Waller do
 
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
you have a question I do
 
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
um you were probably this is probably
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
the first time in all of the
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
presentations that we have heard that I
 
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
heard that any place had a stable
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
Workforce and I wanted to know what do
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
you attribute that to
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's a really great question and
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
if I'm being perfectly honest a good
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
portion of the path staff came from New
 
01:26:52.209 --> 01:26:52.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
 
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
and although that's exciting because it
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
was you know a continuity of care and it
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
was folks that really understood the
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
services and and mission of that program
 
01:27:06.169 --> 01:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
it was you know difficult for a New
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to lose those staff
 
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.450 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to lose those staff
members

01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:10.460 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
and I have my two regular questions is
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
there anything in House Bill 2 and that
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
relate to
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
um either New Hampshire hospital or path
 
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
and where the prioritize needs that were
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
Nathan's going to help me out with this
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
hang on one minute
 
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
sure so um we we already talked about
 
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
the uh the forensic uh the forensic
 
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital admissions
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
provision in section 231 we we did have
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
a number of prioritized needs around the
 
01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
question of enhancements I think we've
 
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
talked about this before this has come
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
up in other areas where we have
 
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
positions and the existing labor grade
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
is not and the pay scale is not
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
sufficient uh to attract
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
um to attract employees to those
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
positions we go through a process with a
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
division of personnel where you have to
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
make a justification and then those are
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
submitted to the governor and executive
 
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.990 align:start position:0%
submitted to the governor and executive
Council

01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
Council
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
um we we originally did submit those
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs however
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
um I know that there are ongoing
 
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
negotiations between between the the
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
union and the governor's office to
 
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
address that through that through that
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
process as as I understand it at this
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
point in time and I'm not sure whether
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel has come to
 
01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
this committee to talk about the
 
01:28:34.729 --> 01:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
reclassification initiative that I think
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
we've briefly touched on previously to
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
so in House Bill 2 on page 89 there is a
 
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
section 282
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's about receiving facilities and I
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could talk a little bit
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
about that and then I'd like to know if
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
it would be possible that we have
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
someone from the hospital Association
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
also talk about this piece sure this is
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
people waiting in the emergency rooms
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
yep so so that is let me just catch up
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
with you here that is those are sections
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
282 283 and 284 and this requires
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
hospitals to have a certain number of
 
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
drf beds based on the hospital's side
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
size to provide services to involuntary
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions for those in Mental
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
Health crisis
 
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
so do you have any information now about
 
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
how many beds we have now and what what
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
this chain what this what this really
 
01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
will mean how many additional beds we
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
will have
 
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think we have any specific
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
information at this point around what
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
additional beds this may relate to
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
however there are approximately 60 beds
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility beds
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire hospital that
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
could and are able to take involuntary
 
01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.090 align:start position:0%
could and are able to take involuntary
patients

01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
and so with the with these sections of
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 increase the number of beds
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
available or yes yes but we don't know
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
I would like to know if we could have
 
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
someone from the hospital Association
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
speak to this section
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
in the questions that you asked
 
01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
um we're we're trying to organize those
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
questions because we've had several on
 
01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
our side and so if you want to
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
as you dump them over to the the
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
department if you just would copy Us in
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that we can help track because you're
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
asking great questions you just heard
 
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.290 align:start position:0%
asking great questions you just heard
them

01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
well I I would like from the Department
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
maybe is what they how many additional
 
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
beds how many we have now how many
 
01:30:59.930 --> 01:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
additional beds you would anticipate
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
this section these sections would
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
um provide
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
I don't personally have that information
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
but we're happy to take that back and
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
and get that answer for you
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
and Mr I always mispronounce his name uh
 
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
a-h-e-r-n I think was from the hospital
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
Association he was here just a moment
 
01:31:28.729 --> 01:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
would he be willing in a moment to take
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
an impromptu question from
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
great and I will just add again Marissa
 
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
had an associate commissioner that we
 
01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
are working on getting those numbers
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and obviously the the language is is
 
01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
a collaboration with the with the
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
governor's office and so we need to work
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
with them to fully understand
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
um the intent
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
um and so uh so more to come but the key
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
point there is this is envisioned as a
 
01:31:58.980 --> 01:31:59.870 align:start position:0%
point there is this is envisioned as a
partnership

01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
um where as you just heard from Ellen
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's um the bulk of the drf beds are
 
01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
and will be at New Hampshire hospital
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
um for these patients needing ieas but
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
by coming together in partnership with
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
other hospitals that's the intent of
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
do you want to continue sure I'd be
 
01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
happy to are there any additional
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
questions about the path program that I
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
so I missed it um
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
we initially used
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
um some buildings that were on the
 
01:32:38.159 --> 01:32:39.410 align:start position:0%
um some buildings that were on the
campus

01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
campus
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
are we are we still satisfied with the
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
buildings we have on campus are we
 
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
looking for additional space I I've just
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
forgotten what facilities we use sure so
 
01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so the path
 
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
program is based out of the Philbrook
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
building which is
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
um across the campus from New Hampshire
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
hospital and the transitional housing
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
component of that building is only a
 
01:33:06.370 --> 01:33:06.380 align:start position:0%
portion of the of the Philbrook Building
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital does have
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
occupancy in the remainder of that
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
building with several individuals that
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't need to be on site at New
 
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital but do need to be in
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
close proximity and those individuals
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
are our I.T folks our finance folks and
 
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
that's essentially because we're so
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
tight for space at New Hampshire
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
hospital that moving those individuals
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
into the Philbrook Building made a lot
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
of sense so in terms of additional space
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
we we always could use more but we're
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
satisfied at this point
 
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
seeing commissioner Weaver has some
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
experience in Facilities Management
 
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe we could find her and you
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
could ask but uh rep you have a question
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
so the space that you're using for
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
administrative functions now that's at
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
the Philbrook Center if those functions
 
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
could go elsewhere would that fill book
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
space provide us with more residential
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
would we be able to have another program
 
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
similar to path
 
01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.090 align:start position:0%
similar to path
um

01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
I think I'd have to we'd have to think
 
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit more it did
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
require funding for construction
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you know there there is occupancy
 
01:34:26.649 --> 01:34:26.659 align:start position:0%
needs under their certification around
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
patient spaces needing windows and
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
access to corridors and whatnot I'm not
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily sure that the remainder of
 
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
that building's setup is conducive to
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
that but but I'm happy to take that back
 
01:34:41.570 --> 01:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
and and try to think about that some
 
01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
more great thank you
 
01:34:48.110 --> 01:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
all right and I don't see any other wait
 
01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.149 align:start position:0%
all right and I don't see any other wait
um

01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
can we take a little bit of an interrupt
 
01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
I think this is all consistent of Mr
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
eight I screw your name up every time
 
01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:02.570 align:start position:0%
eight I screw your name up every time
Ahern

01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay could you come up and would you
 
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
accept a question from representative
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
Wallner she's interested in uh
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
I call it Ed warehousing there's a nicer
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record Steve
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
onnan the New Hampshire Hospital
 
01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.890 align:start position:0%
onnan the New Hampshire Hospital
Association

01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking a
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
question so I was looking at House Bill
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
2 and there is on page 89 section 282
 
01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:40.739 align:start position:0%
and section 283 there's a considerable
 
01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:43.690 align:start position:0%
amount of language here about
 
01:35:43.690 --> 01:35:44.030 align:start position:0%
amount of language here about
[Music]

01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.010 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:45.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Hospital licensing and
 
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.110 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Hospital licensing and
hospitals

01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:51.120 align:start position:0%

um

01:35:51.729 --> 01:35:51.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:51.739 --> 01:35:53.390 align:start position:0%
um
providing

01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.189 align:start position:0%
providing
um

01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
designated receiving beds and I wanted
 
01:35:59.209 --> 01:35:59.219 align:start position:0%
to know if your Association has looked
 
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
at these sections and
 
01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:02.689 align:start position:0%
at these sections and
um

01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
have you done any analysis of how many
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
how many beds this would provide
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
um yes we have seen the language
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
obviously didn't have that before House
 
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 was released
 
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
um but we have seen that
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and do not believe that that is the
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate response um to require as a
 
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
condition of licensure
 
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
um I've searched the country and I don't
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
know that there is another state that
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
requires hospitals as a condition of
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
their license to operate designated
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
receiving facility beds but I haven't
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's an exhaustive search
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
but so far have not turned that up
 
01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.669 align:start position:0%
but so far have not turned that up
um

01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
this is a challenge and a problem that
 
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
has existed for the better part of a
 
01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:48.620 align:start position:0%
decade and it requires
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
investments in a whole host of areas not
 
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
just inpatient care we've heard a lot
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
about the Investments that are being
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
made across the system to ensure that
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
patients are able to get the right Care
 
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
at the right place at the right time but
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
mental health as most every other as
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
every other health care condition
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
um there is a Continuum sometimes we
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
treat people out here in the community
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes we treat them in the hospital
 
01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:16.940 align:start position:0%
and as they move through that Continuum
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that we don't have
 
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
enough inpatient capacity The Proposal
 
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
that would that is in House Bill 2 that
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
would require every hospital to operate
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
a designated receiving facility that
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
depending on the number depending upon
 
01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:31.940 align:start position:0%
their size
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
really makes very little sense from an
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
operational perspective you know we've
 
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
heard about the Staffing challenges that
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
exist at New Hampshire hospital they
 
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
exist all across the state
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
um in in hospitals and Healthcare
 
01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:48.169 align:start position:0%
um in in hospitals and Healthcare
settings

01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
settings
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
if every hospital small hospital had to
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
have two beds or four beds where would
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
they find those health care workers to
 
01:37:58.570 --> 01:37:58.580 align:start position:0%
staff those beds
 
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
you know we often hear that private
 
01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
hospitals are able to pay more than the
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
state hospital so those employees tend
 
01:38:09.370 --> 01:38:09.380 align:start position:0%
to move where they can
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
my concern is that you know we're going
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
to be robbing Peter to pay Paul to
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
staff all of these these new units which
 
01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:21.020 align:start position:0%
again is is not what we need to be doing
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
we just heard that uh you know there are
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
two units that are now closed those
 
01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
units from my perspective need to be
 
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:28.910 align:start position:0%
units from my perspective need to be
open

01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
um you know I understand the challenge
 
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
of Staffing units using Travelers and
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
the rest the hospitals across the state
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
are doing that every day to meet the
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
needs of the patients that they're
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
seeing and we need to do that the
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
proposal in House Bill 2 is not the
 
01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
answer we have been and continue to be
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
willing to sit down and work through
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
this to resolve these issues but again
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
this is not the the appropriate response
 
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
and we certainly have very big concerns
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I my second part of my
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
question was have you done any analysis
 
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals about has anyone
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
figured out exactly how many beds this
 
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
um we're working through that and my
 
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
sense is it's probably somewhere North
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
close to 100 additional beds but that's
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
uh we're continuing to work through that
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
again my my view is that's not the the
 
01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate response
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
um and uh we don't believe we should be
 
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
moving in that direction and are you
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire hospitals Health and
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services the governor's office to
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
come up with what would be a solution as
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
um there is litigation that's ongoing
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
and those conversations are occurring uh
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
in that uh in that venue
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
um so we'll continue to to have those
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
conversations at the highest levels that
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
we can to try and find a resolution I
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
guess the other piece that you didn't
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
mention that was in a house bill too is
 
01:39:55.970 --> 01:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
a provision that would remove the
 
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
requirement that patients in an acute
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis that are subject to
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
an iea an involuntary emergency
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
admission are to be transported
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
immediately to the appropriate location
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
to receive the care and due process that
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
they need and deserve and frankly are
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
entitled to under law this would remove
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
that and instead of saying immediately
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
we would transport patients as soon as a
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
bat is available that is simply wrong
 
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
enshrining the current system which is
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
failing patients is not the right answer
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
and we should not be moving in that
 
01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.110 align:start position:0%
and we should not be moving in that
direction

01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
so um just I'm just looking for clarity
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
there are two specific sections 282 and
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
283 and I understand your association's
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
position is that you just oppose both of
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
them yes
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
um and that you're working with
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
relevant people around the court order
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
response to and and so there may be some
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
solution or recommendation we could see
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.639 --> 01:41:09.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you for
 
01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't until this weekend when I
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
was reviewing this section that I I'm
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
from Nashua so I have two very large
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals in my city that there were
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals with fewer than 25 beds
 
01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
um can you just give me an idea of how
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
many of those small local hospitals were
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
talking about and so and just a quick
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that how many beds do they
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
have now that could receive these
 
01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:39.709 align:start position:0%
have now that could receive these
patients

01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
um so there are 31 hospitals in the
 
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire 26 of which are
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
acute care hospitals we have five
 
01:41:49.129 --> 01:41:49.139 align:start position:0%
specialty Rehabilitation hospitals
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire hospital and
 
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
Hampstead um but the 26
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
um hospitals 13 50 of them are small
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
rural hospitals they are called critical
 
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
access hospitals that's a designation
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
from the federal government under the
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare program that limits their
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
capacity to 25 beds so they are
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
traditionally in the you know Northern
 
01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
Western uh you know reaches of the state
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
and the rural communities they have all
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
but um one has 25 beds um as acute care
 
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:21.950 align:start position:0%
but um one has 25 beds um as acute care
beds

01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
beds
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
um upper Connecticut Valley Hospital and
 
01:42:26.209 --> 01:42:26.219 align:start position:0%
Colebrook has fewer I believe
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're staffed for 12. there are
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals so Franklin Regional Hospital
 
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
has a designated receiving facility they
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
have 10 beds that are allocated for that
 
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that they're able to
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
always fully staff and serve 10 patients
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
at a time sometimes it's Staffing
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's because of a mix of
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
patients and the the facility that they
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
have because they have to double they
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
have to book more than one patient in
 
01:42:52.729 --> 01:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
the room sometimes you can't put two
 
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
people in the same room and then Cottage
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
Hospital in Woodsville has a 10 bed gero
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
psych unit it's not a designated
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
receiving facility bed so all of those
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
exist around the state thank you for
 
01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to point out that
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
requiring two beds out of ten is would
 
01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
probably be devastating yeah two beds
 
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the potential 25 or
 
01:43:19.129 --> 01:43:19.139 align:start position:0%
the 10 of the the designated receiving
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
facility so uh as I understand the
 
01:43:21.239 --> 01:43:22.430 align:start position:0%
facility so uh as I understand the
proposal

01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
um Franklin Regional Hospital uh would
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
not have to add additional capacity
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
because they already have
 
01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
um those 10 beds it would only be those
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals that do not have that capacity
 
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:39.659 align:start position:0%
it shows a former guy who used to think
 
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
I knew something about hospitals is is
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
it is is it your position that
 
01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
by requiring you to open up any kind of
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
a new bed in an environment where we
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
have essentially fixed Manpower you
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
would have to rob Peter to pay Paul to
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
open up any different kind of bed and as
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
a result this would be sort of
 
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional in the way of forcing you
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
to make clinical decisions that may not
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for your location well
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
again you would have to have to staff
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
those units with the appropriate staff
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
so to be able to make those clinical
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
decisions I guess my point was you know
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
my My worry is that you know we have a
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
staffing challenge at New Hampshire
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
hospital today and at Hampstead this
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
could only exacerbate that challenge and
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately end up having fewer fewer
 
01:44:36.649 --> 01:44:36.659 align:start position:0%
beds less capacity at New Hampshire
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
hospital in Hampstead than we do today
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
I think I'm going to record that in my
 
01:44:44.689 --> 01:44:44.699 align:start position:0%
head as a yes but
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
um are there are there any other
 
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
questions I really appreciate you coming
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
up and taking impromptu questions from
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
us always happy thank you yeah uh thank
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
you and and to representative tolerski
 
01:44:59.209 --> 01:44:59.219 align:start position:0%
there is a really great graphic that the
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
association publishes it's about a foot
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
wide and maybe 18 inches long that's got
 
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
nice colors with the map that shows all
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals by type and category it's just
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
a beautiful thing I hang it on my wall
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
and it may be that there's a lobbyist
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
here who could get you one of those
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
I I I opened that one just a couple days
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
ago and it's a beautiful graphic and
 
01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
okay so I think we interrupted our path
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
discussion did we interrupt it or had we
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
there's no more questions about the path
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
program I'm happy to move on to the
 
01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
Glencliff information
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions on path
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
all right so Glenn Cliff it is
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
okay so you'll see
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
um in the Glenn Cliff slide deck
 
01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
um of course their mission and vision
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
statement at the beginning
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
their accounting units a little bit of
 
01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:16.629 align:start position:0%
their accounting units a little bit of
history

01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
and some overview one of the things that
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
we didn't point out in the previous
 
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
slides is the delivery system so I just
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
want to make a point to mention slide
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
seven because that is redundant in a
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
couple of the other presentations just
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
so you know where everyone fits
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the services that Glenn
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
Cliff provides they are they service
 
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
residents that have a medical need that
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
require the long-term level of care and
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
have a mental illness or developmental
 
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
disability and haven't been able to have
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
their needs met by other providers so it
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
tends to be that a decent portion of the
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
admissions that Glenn Cliff receives are
 
01:47:01.450 --> 01:47:01.460 align:start position:0%
individuals from New Hampshire hospital
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
and we work collaboratively
 
01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with them in trying to
 
01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
get those individuals moved at a time
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate you can see in the
 
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
slide deck the different level of
 
01:47:15.970 --> 01:47:15.980 align:start position:0%
services that they provide
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
and they do strive to use non-medication
 
01:47:22.609 --> 01:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
modalities and alternative approaches as
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
well as their training their staff in
 
01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
behavioral interventions to try to meet
 
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
the individual residents needs on slide
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
10 you can see their census and it takes
 
01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:38.699 align:start position:0%
you through from fiscal year 18 all the
 
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
way to fiscal year 23. they did have a
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
budgeted census of 116.
 
01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:49.139 align:start position:0%
um you can see more recently that their
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
current census has declined and
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as has been a common theme
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
they are experiencing Staffing concerns
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
that resulted in the need to have a
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
lower maintain a lower census
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
um glencliffe home does also have a wait
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
list that that wait list did grow
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic and again you know
 
01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
due to Staffing challenges that wait
 
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:14.390 align:start position:0%
due to Staffing challenges that wait
list

01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
um remains relatively high you can see
 
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
that in January of 2023 it's right
 
01:48:25.129 --> 01:48:25.139 align:start position:0%
around the 40 mark they're about 15
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
individuals as they understand currently
 
01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital that are also
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
on that weight so where are these 41
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
these 41 aren't in emergency rooms where
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
no there there's maybe a small number
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
might be but but most of them are
 
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
elsewhere correct okay where is the
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
elsewhere uh New Hampshire hospital for
 
01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
one other nursing homes refer
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
individuals to Glenn Cliff there are
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
times to I know Todd's here in the
 
01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:55.010 align:start position:0%
times to I know Todd's here in the
audience

01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
audience
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
um he's well you're welcome to come up
 
01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
Todd if you have more information but
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
there are times that hospitals do make
 
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
referrals to Glenn Cliff but in order to
 
01:49:04.850 --> 01:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
be able eligible to be at Glen Cliff
 
01:49:06.890 --> 01:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
they have to be deferred by other three
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
other nursing facilities in advance of
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
that how'd I do Todd
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Todd Bickford
 
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of glencliffe
 
01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:16.070 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of glencliffe
home

01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and Alan pretty much had it there a
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
majority of folks out of that 41 15 of
 
01:49:22.129 --> 01:49:22.139 align:start position:0%
them are currently at New Hampshire
 
01:49:22.139 --> 01:49:24.050 align:start position:0%
them are currently at New Hampshire
hospital

01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head about 12 of
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
them are at other nursing homes so what
 
01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
occasionally happens is somebody is
 
01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
living in the community they need
 
01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:33.179 align:start position:0%
long-term care services they go to a
 
01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
nursing home and then that nursing home
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
finds that they can't meet the
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral needs or the mental health
 
01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
needs that are on top of the medical
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
needs we do have a few people that are
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
still at home their loved ones are
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
taking care of them but it's becoming a
 
01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:48.659 align:start position:0%
struggle a theme we often see is loved
 
01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
one is taking care of them but now the
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
loved one is also in their 80s and now
 
01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
dealing with somebody that has medical
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
issues and behavioral mental health
 
01:49:57.649 --> 01:49:57.659 align:start position:0%
issues on top of it so it becomes too
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
challenging and then we do have a number
 
01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
of folks that are at other hospitals not
 
01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
in the Ed but they are waiting for
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
placement with us
 
01:50:10.609 --> 01:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
you you're not the the gentleman that
 
01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
presented to us two years ago are you
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
probably am oh you are okay at the time
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
I asked if we could get a site visit and
 
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
because we were in the pandemic it was
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
just not we couldn't execute on that and
 
01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%
you said after the pandemic we could
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
probably arrange something can we could
 
01:50:31.490 --> 01:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
could we start to plan on a glen Cliff
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
Day absolutely I would I would love to
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
have everybody come for a tour because I
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
I it just helps me to see something to
 
01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
walk the ground and stuff I'm also very
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
Visual and it's a an incredible campus a
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
lot of history so I love showing it off
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
so I'd love to arrange that we did it
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
about four years ago we got a couple of
 
01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh 15 passenger vans from New Hampshire
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
hospital and brought up a bunch of folks
 
01:50:54.850 --> 01:50:54.860 align:start position:0%
most of them were from the capitol
 
01:50:57.410 --> 01:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
committee but I would be more than glad
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
to have all of you come up for a tour
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay and so you're you're you're you're
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're we're not going to be able to do
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
anything until after March for sure but
 
01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:09.050 align:start position:0%
anything until after March for sure but
um

01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
so you have a campus with old
 
01:51:13.609 --> 01:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
established buildings so your
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs are probably Rising
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
more rapidly than they would be if these
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
were newer buildings what kind of a
 
01:51:27.290 --> 01:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
maintenance problem are we facing
 
01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
um that's a complex question but in
 
01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:32.030 align:start position:0%
um that's a complex question but in
general

01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
um most of the maintenance that the
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
buildings need again we're a very large
 
01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
campus we're about 70 Acres we have 22
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
buildings 20 of them are being used
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
because I I heard your questions earlier
 
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
about facilities uh two two are
 
01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:47.229 align:start position:0%
about facilities uh two two are
mothballed

01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
mothballed
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
but we have been fortunate over the last
 
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
couple decades of getting a lot of
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
capital projects so the main resident
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
buildings which is the Brown building
 
01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
which has two units in the Lamont
 
01:51:58.970 --> 01:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
building which has two units has
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
received a lot of updates in the last 12
 
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
15 years we've done the roof we've done
 
01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
the windows we've done asbestos
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
abatement so as all those TV shows say
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
it has really good bones so it's mostly
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
aesthetic type maintenance that needs to
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
be done except for our sewage system
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
which we hopefully will be addressing in
 
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
the next biennium and then some things
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
like we're all Steam Heat so a lot of
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
the steam traps need to be replaced but
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
those are all projects that we can
 
01:52:30.530 --> 01:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
manage throughout the next couple
 
01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:31.790 align:start position:0%
manage throughout the next couple
bienniums

01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
bienniums
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
so are those items in your hb1 request
 
01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
are they in the capital budget do you
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
know maybe that's uh so we we had
 
01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
originally submitted in our prioritized
 
01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
need during the agency phase the the
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
waste water replacement
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
um we present we also submitted that
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
within our capital budget and we
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
presented to the capital budget earlier
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh committee earlier this week for the
 
01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:55.010 align:start position:0%
uh committee earlier this week for the
house

01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:52:56.689 --> 01:52:56.699 align:start position:0%
um and we'll be we'll be talking with
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
them next Monday about
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
um about closing out some existing
 
01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
capital budget projects to find funding
 
01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
to replace the Wastewater system so that
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
was that was included in our original PN
 
01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
um and it's you you won't see an
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
additional request here because we're
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
handling that through the capital budget
 
01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:14.570 align:start position:0%
handling that through the capital budget
process

01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:53:17.689 --> 01:53:17.699 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
you want to ask about hb2 are there any
 
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
hp2 items in here are there any hv2
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
items in here
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
um not well in here yes uh I yes
 
01:53:31.850 --> 01:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
um so we we did include two prioritize
 
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
needs um one for each state fiscal year
 
01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
24 and 25
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
1.1 million dollars of General funds and
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
that is to cover uh what would
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
um Todd's team has has identified to be
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
a projected Surplus we uh expect a
 
01:53:48.239 --> 01:53:49.189 align:start position:0%
a projected Surplus we uh expect a
similar

01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
um or not Surplus deficit we expect a
 
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
similar deficit to occur this year that
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
we'll try to cover Through transfers
 
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
um through the through the year-end
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
closed process but I will be submitting
 
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:04.139 align:start position:0%
those those requests um to to Kevin uh
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I think I think you
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
were at the wait list when we took the
 
01:54:17.689 --> 01:54:17.699 align:start position:0%
side tour if I could just add quickly
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
um again glad to have everybody come up
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
for an official tour but on the 25th of
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
March we are having our annual sugar off
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
party so because we still maintain
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
making our own maple syrup so fresh
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
donuts and maple syrup so if anybody
 
01:54:31.090 --> 01:54:31.100 align:start position:0%
wants to come to that it's a 10-1
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
horse-drawn wagon and everything it's a
 
01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
lot of fun you know if we finish our
 
01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
budget work then that could be a reward
 
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Todd
 
01:54:46.729 --> 01:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
um and I will just add that Todd gives a
 
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
phenomenal tour it's a beautiful campus
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
and really a sight to see
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
um their self-sustained environment up
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
there and I would also just take a
 
01:54:58.010 --> 01:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
minute to add that any of the 24 7
 
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
facilities of DHHS we're happy to give
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
anyone a tour and invite you to come
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
we've started working together a little
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
bit more systematically as the 24 7
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
leaders of the different facilities
 
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
throughout DHHS and have kind of
 
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
established somewhat of a committee so
 
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
one of the agenda items on that
 
01:55:18.609 --> 01:55:18.619 align:start position:0%
committee is to really welcome
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
individuals such as yourselves to come
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
to the facilities and really understand
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
more about what we do
 
01:55:27.649 --> 01:55:27.659 align:start position:0%
so the last time representative Weiler
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
and I took a tour of the New Hampshire
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
hospital we couldn't go into the
 
01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
building and so we were marched around
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
the perimeter of the building and the
 
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
cold and the wet and and I thought wow
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
this is a really warm welcome but no but
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
it was enough to see the problem that
 
01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
you had with the wetlands and building
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
in the wetlands so I I'd be happy to
 
01:55:50.930 --> 01:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
schedule one of those for the New
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital too sure that'd be
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
great we'd welcome you to come uh
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
represent walner
 
01:55:59.330 --> 01:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
yes I noticed in the other presentations
 
01:56:02.290 --> 01:56:02.300 align:start position:0%
that you did New Hampshire hospital
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
and path I think also you had a daily
 
01:56:05.639 --> 01:56:06.609 align:start position:0%
and path I think also you had a daily
rate

01:56:06.609 --> 01:56:06.619 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
and do we have do you have that in the
 
01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
Glenn Close Flags I'm sorry it might be
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
toddler Kevin can you can I invite you
 
01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:34.189 align:start position:0%
toddler Kevin can you can I invite you
up

01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
I apologize that that wasn't in your
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
presentation our current daily rate for
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is
 
01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
378.78 and our private pay rate is
 
01:56:47.090 --> 01:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
427.60 a day
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
great thank you could you please repeat
 
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh Medicaid rate Medicaid rate was
 
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
378.78 and the private pay rate is
 
01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:05.209 align:start position:0%
378.78 and the private pay rate is
427.60

01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
I would like to just point out though
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
that um as a state agency we only
 
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
collect half of that rate because we
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
only collect the federal portion of the
 
01:57:15.709 --> 01:57:15.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we do not collect the state
 
01:57:15.719 --> 01:57:18.770 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we do not collect the state
portion

01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
I I just whoever put slide 12 in here
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
I I think of all of the presentations of
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
all of the slides this comes this may be
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
my very favorite one because it's really
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
the first one that I recall seeing what
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
sort of Manpower benchmarks are being
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
used to identify how much Manpower you
 
01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
need and and it it it at least starts
 
01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
that conversation in a very nice way
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
um it could it could it could come to
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
the conclusion to say exactly how many
 
01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
are Justified you know but but but I
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
love this slide Mr White if if we
 
01:58:06.770 --> 01:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
someday ended up with something like
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
this for multiple agencies that would be
 
01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:10.370 align:start position:0%
this for multiple agencies that would be
great

01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think thank you Mr chair and I if I
 
01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
could just take a minute to elaborate on
 
01:58:15.239 --> 01:58:16.250 align:start position:0%
could just take a minute to elaborate on
that

01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:18.290 --> 01:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
um some of my history prior to coming to
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital is in long-term
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
care but I'm gonna defer to Todd if I
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
get it wrong
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
um in that nursing facilities across the
 
01:58:28.490 --> 01:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
country who fall under CMS which of
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
course glencliffe would um in terms of
 
01:58:34.089 --> 01:58:34.099 align:start position:0%
the fact that they receive federal funds
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities fall into this CMS
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
rating program they have to have to
 
01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
participate in this to be able to be
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
affiliated with CMS so
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
um it's it's something that is on a
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
national level and as you indicated
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
really gives as clear of a picture
 
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
around what national standards are and
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
really where facilities fall within
 
01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:00.060 align:start position:0%
those national standards so I appreciate
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't unless there's additional
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions about Glenn Cliff that we
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
curious on slide 14
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
um the 95.7 percent received the covet
 
01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:28.129 align:start position:0%
um the 95.7 percent received the covet
injection

01:59:28.129 --> 01:59:28.139 align:start position:0%
injection
 
01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
um why isn't that a hundred or you know
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
our residents have the
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
um right to refuse
 
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
um so we have a handful of residents
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
that have declined getting the
 
01:59:42.719 --> 01:59:43.910 align:start position:0%
that have declined getting the
vaccination

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
by declining to refuse do they get a
 
01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
different standard of care in any way
 
01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:54.649 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:59:54.649 --> 01:59:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
I think we're ready for Hampstead
 
02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'm really slow
 
02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
they have the right to refuse but these
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
are like seriously
 
02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:32.990 align:start position:0%
are like seriously
um

02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
these are really serious patients in
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
terms of their mental capacity and I and
 
02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
I just wonder I'm getting more curious
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
about the extent to which they're
 
02:00:47.089 --> 02:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
capable of making a decision to have the
 
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
injection or not
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
so I it tends to be too that there's a
 
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
guardian involvement with several of
 
02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
these individuals and if they have
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
guardianship over the person
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
um those Guardians might be the ones
 
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
making the decision on behalf of those
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
residents okay on us kind of related
 
02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:08.030 align:start position:0%
residents okay on us kind of related
question

02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh how how does glencliffe handle
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots do these patients
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
receive absentee ballots uh in group or
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um it's
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
changed over the I've been at glencliffe
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
for 22 years we used to take all the
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
residents that were interested in voting
 
02:01:37.129 --> 02:01:37.139 align:start position:0%
and we would we would drive them to the
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
town of Benton Town Hall which I don't
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
know if you're familiar with town of
 
02:01:42.850 --> 02:01:42.860 align:start position:0%
Benton but it's like a population of 48
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
and it's on the other side of the
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
mountain and literally you can't get
 
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
there from glencliffe you have to drive
 
02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
around throughout the towns about eight
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
years ago we worked with the town folks
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
and we now have set up a little voting
 
02:01:59.570 --> 02:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
station at Glencliff and the residents
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
that want to vote can go vote
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
independently there so they it's
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
technically absentee balance but it's
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
monitored in um in conjunction with the
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
town so it's kind of a hybrid are they
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
generally aware enough of what's going
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
on to be able to cast an informed ballot
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
and I know that's not the standard that
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
anyone can cast a ballot without any
 
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a competency test so I'm not
 
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
asking a legal question I'm asking just
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
a real world question
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
or do they know what they're doing
 
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of residents that choose to
 
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
vote do and some are very active
 
02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:34.970 align:start position:0%
vote do and some are very active
politically

02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
politically
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
they say on top of the news
 
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
honestly we have a handful or two that
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
you know especially when you're talking
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
about somebody that suffers from
 
02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
paranoid schizophrenic who may have
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
interesting choices when they vote but
 
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
they vote
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
will eventually be proven right anyway
 
02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.089 align:start position:0%
will eventually be proven right anyway
so

02:02:53.089 --> 02:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
these days you never know yeah all right
 
02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh and then to what extent does your
 
02:03:00.729 --> 02:03:00.739 align:start position:0%
staff support them when they're voting
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
other than physically helping them get
 
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
into a booth and those type of things
 
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
they vote on their own our staff are
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
very diligent about not trying to
 
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
influence in One Direction or the other
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
staying as neutral as possible fantastic
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Kathy Collins I'm the
 
02:03:31.129 --> 02:03:31.139 align:start position:0%
CEO of Hampstead Hospital and I have
 
02:03:35.229 --> 02:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
hello I'm John qualter the CFO at
 
02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital
 
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
so following in Ellen's footsteps was
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
good because now I know we can skip over
 
02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:46.139 align:start position:0%
the things we already talked about in
 
02:03:49.729 --> 02:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
the previous pre uh hearing so we will
 
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
skip over to slide number four
 
02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
which brings us to our ftes
 
02:03:57.540 --> 02:03:58.910 align:start position:0%
which brings us to our ftes
um

02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
and as you know from our previous
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
Hampstead is state owned but is run
 
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
clinically by a third party vendor
 
02:04:15.250 --> 02:04:15.260 align:start position:0%
so we have 27 DHHS positions 27 ftes
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
at Hampstead but we have 185 that ftes
 
02:04:24.109 --> 02:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
that fall under the third party vendor
 
02:04:24.119 --> 02:04:27.709 align:start position:0%
that fall under the third party vendor
contract

02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
so part of our key accomplishments that
 
02:04:32.410 --> 02:04:32.420 align:start position:0%
I wanted to review
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
number one was last we were here we were
 
02:04:40.970 --> 02:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
talking about our wait list and our goal
 
02:04:43.490 --> 02:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
for getting our wait list and I'm happy
 
02:04:46.729 --> 02:04:46.739 align:start position:0%
to say that today our wait list is zero
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that was a very big accomplishment
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
for us today so it didn't make it in the
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
slides because it didn't happen until
 
02:04:52.199 --> 02:04:54.350 align:start position:0%
slides because it didn't happen until
today

02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:04:55.970 --> 02:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
um what what's the key reason for
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
hitting zero the diminished demand
 
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
increased Manpower letting you open new
 
02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
beds what was the key factor
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
um you'll see actually in the slides
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
that we've been able to increase our
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
capacity and our beds but that coupled
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
with I think the system is just really
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
working the way it's supposed to be
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
right now with children's system of care
 
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
and we're actually able to treat the
 
02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
children we're starting to see once we
 
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
get them out of the emergency rooms and
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
into lower levels of care that we've
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
been working on
 
02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
not as many people are actually needing
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
the beds 100
 
02:05:39.169 --> 02:05:39.179 align:start position:0%
it's also school vacation week in New
 
02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire last week so there is a little
 
02:05:45.010 --> 02:05:45.020 align:start position:0%
bit less demand but we have been able to
 
02:05:48.169 --> 02:05:48.179 align:start position:0%
open up more beds on a general
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis so so is it accurate
 
02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
then to assume that your weight list of
 
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
zero means that we have no kids in an
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
emergency room in New Hampshire being
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
boarded waiting a bed
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
as of this morning there were zero
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
patients waiting for a bed at Hampstead
 
02:06:11.689 --> 02:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
in an emergency room which is a slightly
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
different answer than my question does
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
that mean there are no kids in an
 
02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
emergency room anywhere
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
needing a bed
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
I could only answer if there's a
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
referral to Hampstead so so you're not
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
omnipotent I'm not okay all right sorry
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
no I just I I just it's such a tragic
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
thing to have people stuck in the
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms waiting for care and
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's particular heinous when it's kids
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
so go ahead so in terms of our current
 
02:06:45.609 --> 02:06:45.619 align:start position:0%
wait list for the State of New Hampshire
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital is the only facility
 
02:06:50.689 --> 02:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
providing this type of psychiatric care
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of these kids are
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
voluntary patients as opposed to the
 
02:06:58.129 --> 02:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
ieas which which Hampstead in the past
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
has also been able to accommodate so I
 
02:07:03.050 --> 02:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
guess I want to give that added
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
um credit where it's due that in fact
 
02:07:08.930 --> 02:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
the the wait list is in fact a zero
 
02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
meaning while there could be patients
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
with other needs that are being met by
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
other providers uh the wait list and the
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
Ed boarding as it's understood for kids
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
is is specifically a Hampstead only list
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
um and maybe this is I'm not sure who
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
the right person is so hey there doctor
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
and it's an understanding of when is an
 
02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
iea the right course of action I know
 
02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
it's not budget related but I'm trying
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
to understand how that impacts the
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
number of children right in particular
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
and what are the safeguards that exist
 
02:07:48.719 --> 02:07:50.270 align:start position:0%
and what are the safeguards that exist
right

02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
can that process be abused not abused
 
02:07:52.679 --> 02:07:54.530 align:start position:0%
can that process be abused not abused
right

02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:07:56.209 --> 02:07:56.219 align:start position:0%
um I saw in one of the notes in one of
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
the slides that we're talking about
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
um people going I think this was the
 
02:08:03.169 --> 02:08:03.179 align:start position:0%
adult section right by who have been
 
02:08:03.179 --> 02:08:05.149 align:start position:0%
adult section right by who have been
adjudicated

02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
um Not Guilty by reason of insanity
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's a very different standard so help
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
me as someone who's new to all of this
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
understand that whole process and are
 
02:08:16.129 --> 02:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
you asking about ieas in general or
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
specific to children
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
General as a process overall specific to
 
02:08:22.729 --> 02:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
children as it impacts that population
 
02:08:24.649 --> 02:08:24.659 align:start position:0%
the most okay so I think why doesn't
 
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
Kathy start with her explanation and we
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
may want to call on Ellen for some
 
02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
additional insight there on the point so
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'll let them take it thanks
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
all right so as far as with children the
 
02:08:39.169 --> 02:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
number one criteria it for an iea is
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
that they're a danger to themselves or
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
others and that they're in need of care
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
the patients under 18 are not eligible
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
or competent to make a decision about
 
02:08:55.129 --> 02:08:55.139 align:start position:0%
their care and therefore they have a
 
02:08:57.649 --> 02:08:57.659 align:start position:0%
guardian a parent that would make that
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
determination so as long as they are
 
02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
voluntary by Guardian they would be able
 
02:09:05.810 --> 02:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
to be non-i8 and receive voluntary
 
02:09:08.570 --> 02:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
Services provided the guardian is is
 
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
so what happens when there's a conflict
 
02:09:17.330 --> 02:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
between let's say child protective
 
02:09:20.089 --> 02:09:20.099 align:start position:0%
services and the parents are Guardians
 
02:09:23.229 --> 02:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
relative to this child's in a hospital
 
02:09:26.209 --> 02:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
and someone is offering I want I want to
 
02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
keep the child there under an iea just I
 
02:09:30.890 --> 02:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
want to understand what safeguards are
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
in place on both sides
 
02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
so the if an iea petition if a parent is
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
not willing or a guardian not willing to
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
sign a patient in that a provider deems
 
02:09:46.129 --> 02:09:46.139 align:start position:0%
needs that level of care then an iea
 
02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
petition would be filed and we would
 
02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
follow the normal procedure
 
02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
through the court process through the
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.530 --> 02:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
did you need more clarification from
 
02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:59.870 align:start position:0%
did you need more clarification from
Ellen

02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
Ellen
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
I think for now that answers it okay
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
okay all right so moving forward
 
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
um obviously our key accomplishment is
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
we're in month nine of State ownership
 
02:10:15.770 --> 02:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
and that in and of itself has been a big
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
lift to get us over that hump from
 
02:10:21.729 --> 02:10:21.739 align:start position:0%
private to State ownership
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
we developed our new Mission Vision
 
02:10:27.649 --> 02:10:27.659 align:start position:0%
Values we also have
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
joined in collaboration with the
 
02:10:31.609 --> 02:10:31.619 align:start position:0%
integrated system of care to improve the
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
identification of appropriate levels of
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
care for children in the state of New
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to try to serve them at the
 
02:10:41.149 --> 02:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
need at the needed level that they they
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
um next question about that
 
02:10:50.089 --> 02:10:50.099 align:start position:0%
we've probably seen or heard something
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
in this division about the hhrtf could
 
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
you could you just spend like 10 seconds
 
02:10:59.930 --> 02:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
telling us what that acronym is and then
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
I get curious anytime I see a broad
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
organization I wonder about it's
 
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
organizational competency is it is it
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
actually able to be effective
 
02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
so if you could tell us what it is and
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
tell us about its effectiveness
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to answer your first part
 
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
first and it's Hampstead Hospital and
 
02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility that's
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
what hhrtf stands for
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
and then your second question I'm going
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
to ask for some clarification so I'm
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna amend my first question
 
02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:35.450 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna amend my first question
then

02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:11:37.689 --> 02:11:37.699 align:start position:0%
so that's Hampstead Hospital
 
02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
collaborating with an integrated system
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
of care
 
02:11:44.689 --> 02:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
is that an entity or is that a concept
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's a concept it's the children's
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
system of care throughout the state of
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which includes dcyf and
 
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
Children's Bureau of Mental Health
 
02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
so so that's a little amorphous right
 
02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
just naturally because it's the entire
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
integrated system of care
 
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
and and and and again we don't have
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
accountability and control of that
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
system of care so I'm I just get curious
 
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're able to
 
02:12:17.689 --> 02:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
be effectively effective collaborators
 
02:12:20.330 --> 02:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
with something that's not
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
well established or well defined
 
02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
this is a new collaboration for
 
02:12:28.209 --> 02:12:28.219 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital
 
02:12:31.129 --> 02:12:31.139 align:start position:0%
because we were not part of that system
 
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
of care so we were working outside of
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
the the walls if you will of that
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
construct before and now we are able to
 
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
be part of that system so that we
 
02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
actually can impact and have more of
 
02:12:50.089 --> 02:12:50.099 align:start position:0%
discussion and collaboration to be sure
 
02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
that we're able to find the right bed or
 
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious about something
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I think Hampstead Hospital might be
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
place that New Hampshire has had a
 
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
situation where we have the
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
administration of the hospital or the
 
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
service being provided is with state
 
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
employees and then there's a contract
 
02:13:27.890 --> 02:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
for the actual care and I'm interested
 
02:13:30.169 --> 02:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
one and how that you think that's
 
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
working how long is the contract with
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
well well path
 
02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:35.149 align:start position:0%
well well path
um

02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
as a model I'm just interested in
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's something that
 
02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:41.870 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's something that
might

02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
be looked at in other areas are there
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
advantages are what are the
 
02:13:45.119 --> 02:13:47.330 align:start position:0%
advantages are what are the
disadvantages

02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
disadvantages
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so we
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
um collaborate we're lucky in this
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
contract that the executive director for
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
the well path is a long-standing was the
 
02:14:00.589 --> 02:14:00.599 align:start position:0%
director of nursing for Hampstead
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
Hospital as well so there is some
 
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
longevity on that side as well to
 
02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
Department actually oversees all aspects
 
02:14:13.609 --> 02:14:13.619 align:start position:0%
of the contract
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't go without its challenges
 
02:14:17.709 --> 02:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
of course
 
02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
to oversee any contract but we have a
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
very good working relationship and we
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
are working out any you know issues with
 
02:14:31.609 --> 02:14:31.619 align:start position:0%
delivery of Care Systems and things like
 
02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
that we meet our executive team is
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually comprised of the well path
 
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
Recovery Solutions we are pretty much
 
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
half and half between DHHS leadership
 
02:14:48.890 --> 02:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
and well path Recovery Solutions I it is
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
a larger scale model of what happens at
 
02:14:53.050 --> 02:14:53.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital
 
02:14:56.050 --> 02:14:56.060 align:start position:0%
they have a contract for their providers
 
02:14:59.930 --> 02:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
and so it is it is definitely something
 
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
that that works we're able to impact on
 
02:15:06.649 --> 02:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
different levels the
 
02:15:10.729 --> 02:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
attraction of staff so to speak that is
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
not as big of an issue as it is with
 
02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
State entities because there's a little
 
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
and and just to to further answer your
 
02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
question representative walner
 
02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:29.099 align:start position:0%
um so back in in 2022 when the when the
 
02:15:31.850 --> 02:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
state acquired Hampstead Hospital we had
 
02:15:33.890 --> 02:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
entered into a two-year sole source
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
contract with Hampstead Outlook Inc
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and and we have been working on and
 
02:15:41.089 --> 02:15:41.099 align:start position:0%
and we told the executive council at the
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
time when we brought that forward I
 
02:15:44.089 --> 02:15:44.099 align:start position:0%
believe we told the fiscal committee as
 
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
well that when we brought that forward
 
02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
we would be going back out to Bid And so
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
we've already we're well into the the
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
RFP development process so that we make
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
sure that many months prior to that
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
contract expiring that we already have a
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%
signed contract with um with whether
 
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's Hampstead if they win or it's
 
02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
another party that with that wins based
 
02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
on the objective criteria that we
 
02:16:10.129 --> 02:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
include within that procurement
 
02:16:10.139 --> 02:16:12.109 align:start position:0%
include within that procurement
okay

02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
I have one one more question so
 
02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
um the workforce
 
02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
um that well well path their employees
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
they're in the process of
 
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
um negotiating a Union contract yes
 
02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.129 --> 02:16:39.139 align:start position:0%
representative stream uh kind of a
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
budgetary question I mean obviously this
 
02:16:44.530 --> 02:16:44.540 align:start position:0%
is only nine months I would expect
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
maybe more variability going forward in
 
02:16:49.250 --> 02:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
the results in this than maybe other
 
02:16:52.849 --> 02:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
budget items and especially with such a
 
02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of the budget is
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
this I think one contract right so and
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh and that that that contract I think
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
you said uh were were you know roughly
 
02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
halfway through the two-year contract
 
02:17:10.490 --> 02:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
the second second uh the renewal will
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
kick in
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
um you know a year and three months from
 
02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:15.169 align:start position:0%
um you know a year and three months from
now

02:17:15.169 --> 02:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'm kind of interested in
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
your in in your perspective on how much
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
variability we might expect in
 
02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:26.929 align:start position:0%
variability we might expect in
performance

02:17:26.929 --> 02:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
performance
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
um or financial performance or need in
 
02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
this group
 
02:17:34.129 --> 02:17:34.139 align:start position:0%
sure so I'll I'll take it from from the
 
02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
finance angle and then I'll and then
 
02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
I'll hand it over to Kathy
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
um so we actually don't we don't have
 
02:17:41.450 --> 02:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
any renewals within that contract it's
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's a two-year sole source and so
 
02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
we will be going out to bid
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
um the the Hampstead budget is on page
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
1092 the governor's recommended budget
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
um the big the big class line is is the
 
02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:55.549 align:start position:0%
um the big the big class line is is the
102

02:17:55.549 --> 02:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
102
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
um where we have a it's about
 
02:17:58.750 --> 02:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 27 million dollar
 
02:18:01.849 --> 02:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
contract and as as Kathy had indicated
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
it is a slightly different not slightly
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
it's a different model than the New
 
02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
um we and and Sean has been working
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
um on on looking at the expense at
 
02:18:15.889 --> 02:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
looking at the expenses as we go forward
 
02:18:17.330 --> 02:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
looking at the revenues that we're
 
02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:19.019 align:start position:0%
bringing in
 
02:18:20.810 --> 02:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
um in the governor's recommended budget
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh we we did have a reduction of four
 
02:18:25.849 --> 02:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars in general
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
funds from the agency budget in the
 
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
current current biennium the they're
 
02:18:33.290 --> 02:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
roughly nine million dollars there that
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're asking for General funds in 24
 
02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's covered through arpa funds
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
um and and I my plan was to submit to
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
the committee an analysis of our
 
02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
revenues versus our expenses to date
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
because we do we do receive third-party
 
02:18:52.129 --> 02:18:52.139 align:start position:0%
revenues and it's always our objective
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
to maximize those as much as we can but
 
02:18:57.650 --> 02:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
we do you know we we do have some risk
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
there and we are also taking a closer
 
02:19:01.849 --> 02:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
look at each of the class lines that
 
02:19:04.129 --> 02:19:04.139 align:start position:0%
were originally based upon New Hampshire
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
hospitals budget and their spend and we
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
are seeing some variation there so so my
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
plan was to follow up with the committee
 
02:19:14.929 --> 02:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
to provide that analysis to now that we
 
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
have a few more months of information to
 
02:19:20.690 --> 02:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
to go to go on uh to try to get us to um
 
02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I'll dub the a happier place
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
so to speak when it when it comes to our
 
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
revenues and our expenditures
 
02:19:30.349 --> 02:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
and and when would that update be and
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
would that be part of this process that
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
we're in now
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I would hope to have that to you by
 
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
the end of the week okay
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
um and this would affect this but may go
 
02:19:42.770 --> 02:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
back to Glen Cliff as well because I I
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
thought he um I thought I heard that you
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
know some money comes from the federal
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
government directly to glencliffe maybe
 
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's some of the the money that comes
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
in here but we don't see on the budget
 
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
items federal funds uh for either of
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
these two facilities but apparently
 
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
there are federal funds and if if this
 
02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:02.750 align:start position:0%
there are federal funds and if if this
went

02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
went
 
02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:04.190 align:start position:0%
went
um

02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:07.490 --> 02:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
um if if the services went away there
 
02:20:09.530 --> 02:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
actually would be reduction in money
 
02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
going to um to those facilities and
 
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
hence the state since we own them do I
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
understand that correctly yep so on on
 
02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
page uh 1093 the budget you have the
 
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
transfer from other agencies lines uh
 
02:20:25.969 --> 02:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
those are our dish funds those are the
 
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
funds that we receive it's actually a
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
transfer uh from the Medicaid budget to
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
cover uncompensated care costs the the
 
02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
agency income uh those are the the
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
patient revenues and Sean and Kathy can
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
certainly elaborate further on those and
 
02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
then the general fund uh amount there
 
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with the budget that
 
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
we had put forth for this biennium only
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
it is no longer arpa funds it is now
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
General funds as those are profunds
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:58.800 --> 02:20:59.809 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:20:59.809 --> 02:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay and that 20 20 million in agency
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
income that's from
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
from who what kind of organizations do
 
02:21:09.889 --> 02:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
you want to Leverage
 
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
would be a common Revenue received from
 
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh Managed Care organizations and uh
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
so the next phase that we're looking at
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
is our interagency development of our
 
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
prtf which will be the first psychiatric
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Facility in the
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for level five
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
Residential Care
 
02:21:48.490 --> 02:21:48.500 align:start position:0%
the program development for that is
 
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
completed and the construction for that
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
is beginning and we are intending to go
 
02:21:57.969 --> 02:21:57.979 align:start position:0%
live with that program
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:05.570 --> 02:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
as we move forward as everyone else has
 
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
spoken our key challenges are our
 
02:22:13.210 --> 02:22:13.220 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenges we have a 49
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
counselor vacancy rate for our Direct
 
02:22:20.450 --> 02:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
Care and 38 for our nurses
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
uh but we have seen significant
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
increases though in our ability to
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
recruit for those positions which has
 
02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
allowed those additional beds from the
 
02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
last time that we were here
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
the other key challenges is the
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
increased need for mental health
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
services that we've all seen post
 
02:22:41.450 --> 02:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
pandemic and during the pandemic
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then also the other challenge that
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampstead is has is the key
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and network
 
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and systems is we had
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
none I think we talked last time I have
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're a paper and we are still paper and
 
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
we're moving hopefully towards more of
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
an electronic ability to
 
02:23:09.969 --> 02:23:09.979 align:start position:0%
document so I've thought about that and
 
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
most institutions have moved to an EHR
 
02:23:15.790 --> 02:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
because Medicare
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
held out money for them to have
 
02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
incentives for doing it
 
02:23:25.250 --> 02:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
what what is your incentive to move out
 
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
of paper into digital is is there a
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
money issue is there a productivity
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
issue is it just because issue I mean
 
02:23:35.690 --> 02:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
what what's your motivation
 
02:23:38.990 --> 02:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's coordination of care is
 
02:23:41.330 --> 02:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
really the number one
 
02:23:44.809 --> 02:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
driver for more efficient ability to be
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
able to document and to be able to have
 
02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:48.590 align:start position:0%
able to document and to be able to have
records

02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:23:52.670 --> 02:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
follow patients across a continuum
 
02:23:56.270 --> 02:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
financially I'd have to defer to Nathan
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
well I I think one um one important
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
thing just to point out here is we we
 
02:24:04.130 --> 02:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
did submit a request for electronic
 
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
health records systems
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
um to to address the issue at all of our
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
24 7 facilities the governor included
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
that in his recommended capital budget
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
and we spoke to the capital budget
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee on Monday about that request
 
02:24:23.809 --> 02:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
to try to create and I'm not going to
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
pretend to sound intelligent when it
 
02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
comes to I.T systems but to try to
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
create a more synthesized system that
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
can speak across the 24 7 facility so
 
02:24:33.770 --> 02:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
we're not having to build out five
 
02:24:36.530 --> 02:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
separate systems we can create a unified
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
system and and day readers can certainly
 
02:24:44.050 --> 02:24:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.210 --> 02:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
all right excellent so I just wanted to
 
02:24:48.770 --> 02:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to slide number
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
eight uh page eight
 
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
this is just the representation of the
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
populations that we've served the number
 
02:24:58.610 --> 02:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
of patients that we've served we gave
 
02:25:02.330 --> 02:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
you a full year look back so there you
 
02:25:05.710 --> 02:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
have six months of pre-state owned
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
there as well but as a total we've
 
02:25:11.650 --> 02:25:11.660 align:start position:0%
served a 1052
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
we also on the next slide you'll see our
 
02:25:24.610 --> 02:25:24.620 align:start position:0%
average census
 
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
that actually you can see how that
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
correlates that our average census for
 
02:25:31.969 --> 02:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
each month we're actually seeing that
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
upper trajectory that goes along with
 
02:25:37.490 --> 02:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
our increased Recruitment and onboarding
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
on slide 10. so that doesn't make sense
 
02:25:46.849 --> 02:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
to me I'm sure it makes sense it just
 
02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
didn't make sense to me I your weight as
 
02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
you're adding staff
 
02:25:55.309 --> 02:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
I don't understand the correlation of
 
02:25:57.770 --> 02:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
why adding an onboarding staff would
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
increase the wait list are you I would
 
02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
think this is the census sorry this is
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
the census
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
so these are these are the patients that
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
are in the hospital oh so I was looking
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
at the title average census and wait
 
02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
list and so I assumed the numbers were
 
02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
weightless yeah sorry nope they had I
 
02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:17.389 align:start position:0%
weightless yeah sorry nope they had I
apologize

02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
um that information didn't make it onto
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
the slide the waitlist piece okay
 
02:26:23.450 --> 02:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
I was having the same problem with it I
 
02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand how you add census
 
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
and weightless together nope sorry I
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
apologize the title of the slide shut up
 
02:26:33.650 --> 02:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
it's okay it's just making sure we're
 
02:26:35.809 --> 02:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
paying attention I it's a it's a gimmick
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
I get it uh representative hole I think
 
02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
we passed the test on that one um
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
question back on slide eight
 
02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
you sum up the numbers in both the
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
pre-state owned and the state-owned but
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
are any of those the same person between
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
the first six months or is this based on
 
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
either people coming into the facility
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
or leaving the facility how are you
 
02:26:58.370 --> 02:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
tracking the numbers yep yep these are
 
02:27:01.010 --> 02:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
all individuals served uh Unique
 
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:10.370 --> 02:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
and then the last slide that I have for
 
02:27:12.770 --> 02:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
you is just our average Admissions and
 
02:27:15.889 --> 02:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
discharges by month I know we talked
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
previously and I wanted to show
 
02:27:22.690 --> 02:27:22.700 align:start position:0%
um that we had seen that our admissions
 
02:27:25.690 --> 02:27:25.700 align:start position:0%
our discharges and admissions were
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
disproportionate and we wanted to be
 
02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
able to show that they we are actually
 
02:27:33.370 --> 02:27:33.380 align:start position:0%
able to see an increase of admissions
 
02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
average admissions per day based again
 
02:27:42.050 --> 02:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
on being able to increase the census
 
02:27:44.690 --> 02:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
is this is this a normal ratio for for
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
your client base I it it feels like in
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
February we've got about 10 percent
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
turnover on your census per month
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
that feels slow to me from my
 
02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
understanding of healthcare but this is
 
02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
a different population is this is this
 
02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:05.270 align:start position:0%
a different population is this is this
normal

02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
normal
 
02:28:07.849 --> 02:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
yes these are these are our admissions
 
02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
and discharges in average just in
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
relation to each other but our average
 
02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
length of stay is around 10 days we did
 
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
see a significant increase in that over
 
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:21.660 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic but we are starting
 
02:28:23.809 --> 02:28:23.819 align:start position:0%
to see that average length of stay start
 
02:28:28.610 --> 02:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
to come down to an average of 10.
 
02:28:31.730 --> 02:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
all right so it's just me having trouble
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
with the visual information I think but
 
02:28:37.309 --> 02:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions anyone
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
please remind me what what is if you
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
have we're fully if everyone was fully
 
02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:46.610 align:start position:0%
have we're fully if everyone was fully
staffed

02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
staffed
 
02:28:49.250 --> 02:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
um what would be your sin what would you
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
um how many patients would you be able
 
02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
to care for yeah our maximum inpatient
 
02:28:58.130 --> 02:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
capacity currently is 55. we do have the
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
one unit that is closed it is being
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
renovated with Behavioral Health
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
Furniture the opposite actually of what
 
02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
Ellen was doing we're trying to turn
 
02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
ours into more kid-friendly because that
 
02:29:14.050 --> 02:29:14.060 align:start position:0%
was our adult unit
 
02:29:21.650 --> 02:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
so once that unit is on um is on open it
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
would actually give us 70 the ability
 
02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
for 70 inpatient beds and then with the
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:39.290 --> 02:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
with the contract
 
02:29:42.410 --> 02:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
is the contractor is having they're
 
02:29:42.420 --> 02:29:43.610 align:start position:0%
is the contractor is having they're
having

02:29:43.610 --> 02:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:29:48.110 --> 02:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
um Staffing issues also is that correct
 
02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
so as they are not able to staff
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're not able to
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
bring in more children is there any
 
02:29:59.870 --> 02:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility within the contract I mean
 
02:30:01.969 --> 02:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
if these were state employees you
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be you would you would have
 
02:30:05.809 --> 02:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
empty positions
 
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
is there any flexibility when they can't
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:14.929 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:30:14.929 --> 02:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:19.730 --> 02:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
yep so the as far as our costs and
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
expenditures are directly proportionate
 
02:30:26.210 --> 02:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
to our census so as we are able to
 
02:30:28.849 --> 02:30:28.859 align:start position:0%
increase and we have the Staffing then
 
02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
those beds are staffed if we don't have
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
the staff available then the census is
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
capped at what we do have this these
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
staff for so the costs are directly
 
02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:40.969 align:start position:0%
staff for so the costs are directly
proportionate

02:30:40.969 --> 02:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
proportionate
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.969 --> 02:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:30:46.979 --> 02:30:49.010 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
norgren

02:30:49.010 --> 02:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
norgren
 
02:30:50.889 --> 02:30:50.899 align:start position:0%
so you have
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
regular staff but then you also have the
 
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
extra staff that comes in from outside
 
02:31:01.490 --> 02:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
is that right or are all these staff
 
02:31:01.500 --> 02:31:06.849 align:start position:0%
is that right or are all these staff
members

02:31:06.849 --> 02:31:06.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.849 --> 02:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
sorry we have um all the staff currently
 
02:31:13.309 --> 02:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
we do not have any agency staff
 
02:31:13.319 --> 02:31:14.929 align:start position:0%
we do not have any agency staff
currently

02:31:14.929 --> 02:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:31:20.270 --> 02:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
if if I if I may just kind of add to
 
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:21.230 align:start position:0%
if if I if I may just kind of add to
that

02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:24.770 --> 02:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
um if you do look at the budget on 1092
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
um the the class 12 that you see here
 
02:31:29.570 --> 02:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
these are those six unclassified
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
positions that I think we talked about
 
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
last time and then what you'll see
 
02:31:37.490 --> 02:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see the class 59 on 1093 these
 
02:31:40.130 --> 02:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
are the temporary full-time positions
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
um I I will be making a request for the
 
02:31:44.990 --> 02:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee to consider
 
02:31:48.170 --> 02:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
um to to take the class 59 and move it
 
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
to class 10 so that they would be
 
02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
permanent authorized positions we used
 
02:31:56.210 --> 02:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
Class 59 through the fiscal process
 
02:31:58.370 --> 02:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
um when when this data acquired
 
02:32:00.050 --> 02:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
Hempstead hospital because we weren't
 
02:32:02.330 --> 02:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
able to establish permanent authorized
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
positions there but these 21 state
 
02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:07.490 align:start position:0%
positions there but these 21 state
employees

02:32:07.490 --> 02:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
um they they uh we're requesting that
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
they become just kind of permanent of
 
02:32:15.490 --> 02:32:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
so do you already have a feeling or a
 
02:32:22.250 --> 02:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what you think your total
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
full-time permanent
 
02:32:26.929 --> 02:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
head count request is going to be for
 
02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
um it will be the exact same number that
 
02:32:34.010 --> 02:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
is currently in class uh 50 oh the
 
02:32:38.570 --> 02:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
because last last budget I think it was
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
around 3124 and I'm just curious where
 
02:32:47.389 --> 02:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
you think you're going to end up
 
02:32:49.610 --> 02:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
um you can do that later I just I just
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
thought I'd ask you since it seemed like
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
you may have had the number with you I I
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly I I think in the
 
02:32:59.630 --> 02:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget I think it
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
was 3213 so it'd be adding the the 21 on
 
02:33:08.650 --> 02:33:08.660 align:start position:0%
top of that so it was 200 300 or sorry
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
3230 and throughout the department
 
02:33:12.830 --> 02:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's the only ad you think you're
 
02:33:15.530 --> 02:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
gonna make I recommend or ask we have
 
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
the three requests the three position
 
02:33:19.370 --> 02:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
requests from
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
um the uh the commissioner for
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
facilities earlier today but otherwise
 
02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:25.730 align:start position:0%
facilities earlier today but otherwise
um

02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:27.290 --> 02:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
no we won't have any more position
 
02:33:30.170 --> 02:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
requests at this point okay are there
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
other questions here
 
02:33:34.849 --> 02:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
02:33:37.610 --> 02:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
parting thoughts for us any summary we
 
02:33:39.290 --> 02:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
we didn't bounce you around nearly as
 
02:33:42.050 --> 02:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
much as the other people
 
02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative hole you have a question
 
02:33:46.929 --> 02:33:46.939 align:start position:0%
I do so of the
 
02:33:46.939 --> 02:33:48.730 align:start position:0%
I do so of the
3230

02:33:48.730 --> 02:33:48.740 align:start position:0%
3230
 
02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
positions and change I guess how many of
 
02:33:54.610 --> 02:33:54.620 align:start position:0%
those are currently unfilled in
 
02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
theoretically would not be filled in the
 
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
near time given the the current hiring
 
02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:01.389 align:start position:0%
near time given the the current hiring
climate

02:34:01.389 --> 02:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
climate
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
so last I had checked
 
02:34:06.190 --> 02:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
um I think we were at
 
02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
19.6 vacancy rate
 
02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:11.819 align:start position:0%
um again the the challenge that you
 
02:34:13.730 --> 02:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
you've probably you've heard me refer to
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
earlier was
 
02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I I basically had to instruct each
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
division area based I was a proportion
 
02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
of their General funds uh for this
 
02:34:25.550 --> 02:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
biennium that they had to hold several
 
02:34:27.290 --> 02:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand or for New Hampshire
 
02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
hospital had to hold north of three
 
02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Personnel costs and
 
02:34:33.469 --> 02:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
so you know as we've kind of talked
 
02:34:35.330 --> 02:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
throughout this process some of our
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
positions are 50 50 some are 60 30 so to
 
02:34:40.370 --> 02:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
get to 100 of General funds you may have
 
02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
to hold two positions vacant or you may
 
02:34:44.270 --> 02:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
have to hold more than that so several
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
hundred of the positions that we have
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
today we've never even had the
 
02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put out to to to post and
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
and I know we talked about why don't you
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
put them all out and then move the money
 
02:34:55.969 --> 02:34:55.979 align:start position:0%
around which makes a lot of sense to me
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
but there is a tremendous amount of
 
02:35:01.130 --> 02:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
um uh administrative work and system
 
02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions that that don't assault
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
that don't necessarily allow us to be
 
02:35:06.349 --> 02:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
that Nimble
 
02:35:08.809 --> 02:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have a I don't have a
 
02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
crystal ball answer to your question I
 
02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a good one
 
02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
um but but those are just some just some
 
02:35:14.809 --> 02:35:14.819 align:start position:0%
of the challenges that I want to point
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
out thank you of course
 
02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
so when you refer to system in
 
02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:21.590 align:start position:0%
so when you refer to system in
flexibility

02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
02:35:23.809 --> 02:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
are you referring to the it system
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
itself is not a very robust are you
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
saying that the the procedures that
 
02:35:33.469 --> 02:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
we've wrapped around that system are are
 
02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
not very flexible
 
02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
part of its system part of its rules
 
02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
part of it's uh just process I I think
 
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of components there
 
02:35:48.650 --> 02:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
are solutions that are in place say for
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
um like like our dcyf field staff we'll
 
02:35:54.170 --> 02:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
do Mass postings there so you know even
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
if we have like 50 vacant positions or
 
02:35:58.370 --> 02:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
something like that not all of them
 
02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
funded we'll still we'll utilize those
 
02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
tools that are available to us but in
 
02:36:06.290 --> 02:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
certain cases like if I if I have if I
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
have an area that has
 
02:36:12.170 --> 02:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
um like a very specific position
 
02:36:13.550 --> 02:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
um that is very different from the
 
02:36:15.410 --> 02:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
others I think like Medicaid is a good
 
02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
example of this where they have they
 
02:36:19.610 --> 02:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
have Specialists I I have to make a
 
02:36:21.650 --> 02:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
choice do I post this Specialist or do I
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
post this this specialist because we
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
follow a process where we have to find
 
02:36:28.010 --> 02:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
the funds tie them to the position and
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
the system you know before we go out to
 
02:36:32.450 --> 02:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
post it's it's similar to
 
02:36:33.889 --> 02:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
um you know I can't enter into a
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
contract without being able to encumber
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
the funds within the accounting system
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the same principle
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
so if there was just some flexibility
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
for you to open multiple positions even
 
02:36:51.410 --> 02:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
though you have less in the bank than
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
you would need you still can't do that
 
02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
because of administrative rules or
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
because of the way the it systems are
 
02:36:58.800 --> 02:36:59.929 align:start position:0%
because of the way the it systems are
connected

02:36:59.929 --> 02:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
connected
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's I.T systems it's rules its existing
 
02:37:04.130 --> 02:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
procedures and at the end of the day too
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's just it's resources to have the to
 
02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
to have the folks you know to be able to
 
02:37:10.250 --> 02:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
follow those processes all the way
 
02:37:12.170 --> 02:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
through okay representative walner did
 
02:37:15.410 --> 02:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
I have two questions I have the one the
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
daily rate at Hampstead I'm sorry I
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
and this is one for
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
Mr White
 
02:37:37.309 --> 02:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
um I heard today and yesterday you
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:37:41.630 --> 02:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
um arpa funds that are going away and
 
02:37:43.969 --> 02:37:43.979 align:start position:0%
we're bringing in general funds do you
 
02:37:43.979 --> 02:37:44.870 align:start position:0%
we're bringing in general funds do you
have

02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
um have you done sort of an analysis of
 
02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
division the whole department and how
 
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
much in our fund is being replaced with
 
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
I I have not done the analysis
 
02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
um when we used arpa funds
 
02:38:06.050 --> 02:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
under most circumstances we always try
 
02:38:07.610 --> 02:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
to operate on the principle that these
 
02:38:10.490 --> 02:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
would be one-time costs we do have the
 
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
one hb2 provision for nutrition and
 
02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
transportation that we talked about the
 
02:38:17.389 --> 02:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
other day I think is 3.2 million if I
 
02:38:19.490 --> 02:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
remember correctly
 
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
um we do have this which was a little
 
02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
unprecedented I don't remember the last
 
02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
time the state purchased the hospital
 
02:38:29.389 --> 02:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
no others come to my mind but I can
 
02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
certainly take a look at that and
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
identify other areas to get to your
 
02:38:35.090 --> 02:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
question thank you it was just you
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned it
 
02:38:38.090 --> 02:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
one time each day and I thought well
 
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
maybe it's maybe it's bigger than I
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
thought thanks
 
02:38:41.359 --> 02:38:43.010 align:start position:0%
thought thanks
representative

02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
isn't CFI another area or that's
 
02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:46.429 align:start position:0%
isn't CFI another area or that's
happening

02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:38:52.130 --> 02:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.929 --> 02:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
let me get back to you on that one okay
 
02:39:03.550 --> 02:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
all right Miss Collins
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah I and I forget the cfo's name
 
02:39:12.170 --> 02:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry that we didn't ask you more
 
02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:13.910 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry that we didn't ask you more
questions

02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:15.469 align:start position:0%
questions
yeah

02:39:15.469 --> 02:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:39:18.290 --> 02:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
um but um so thank you do you have any
 
02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
parting words of wisdom for us I I got
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
another question for Mr White
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
um but I do not thank you very much for
 
02:39:27.950 --> 02:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
giving us the opportunity all right uh
 
02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
and thanks for all your uh you're doing
 
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
for our kids appreciate it oh I did have
 
02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
one more question to the extent that
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampstead feels a little geographically
 
02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
isolated you know the road Network there
 
02:39:40.969 --> 02:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't seem like it can get
 
02:39:43.550 --> 02:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
there from very many places to what
 
02:39:46.730 --> 02:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
extent is that hindering your ability to
 
02:39:53.090 --> 02:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
really answer that
 
02:39:58.190 --> 02:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
um a hundred percent but we do
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
um we're doing okay because we're you
 
02:40:03.410 --> 02:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
know geographically located to some
 
02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
larger areas that that are a big draw
 
02:40:08.809 --> 02:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
for us and then those that are over the
 
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
Border just over the Border in
 
02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:14.050 align:start position:0%
Border just over the Border in
Massachusetts

02:40:14.050 --> 02:40:14.060 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
02:40:17.330 --> 02:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
are you following any of the proposed
 
02:40:20.330 --> 02:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
licensing changes in hb2
 
02:40:23.450 --> 02:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
I cannot say that I am okay all right
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
because a question that I would just be
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
curious about your opinion on what the
 
02:40:31.309 --> 02:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
changes proposed in the governor's
 
02:40:33.770 --> 02:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
budget around licensing for health care
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
providers what kind of impact that might
 
02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
have on your ability to recruit there's
 
02:40:41.450 --> 02:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
a tremendous number of proposed changes
 
02:40:43.849 --> 02:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
but I will definitely look into that
 
02:40:46.250 --> 02:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think it may be interesting to
 
02:40:47.929 --> 02:40:47.939 align:start position:0%
you but
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
um all right well thank you thank you so
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
much uh and Mr White I had a question
 
02:40:54.410 --> 02:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
for you that was a little bit bigger
 
02:40:58.429 --> 02:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
than uh just the Hamstead and miss Mr
 
02:41:01.550 --> 02:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
Ripple remember two years ago when Ms
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
rounds put together that spreadsheet
 
02:41:06.170 --> 02:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
that showed the different categories of
 
02:41:08.210 --> 02:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
personnel and how many there were and
 
02:41:10.429 --> 02:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
what the vacancy rates were there was
 
02:41:13.370 --> 02:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
there was a template that she floated on
 
02:41:15.429 --> 02:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
that that was very useful
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
I wonder if if you have access to that
 
02:41:20.809 --> 02:41:20.819 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet if you know what I'm talking
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
about if we could maybe pass it over to
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
Mr White to to give us an update yep I
 
02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
remember that I have it somewhere so I
 
02:41:31.130 --> 02:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
can send it over to Nathan
 
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
02:41:35.809 --> 02:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
um do you have any last words for us
 
02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
only that I forgot to mention the hb2
 
02:41:40.130 --> 02:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
provision for New Hampshire hospital for
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
the two hundred thousand dollars
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
um that was paying to replace two
 
02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:45.230 align:start position:0%
um that was paying to replace two
vehicles

02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
02:41:47.809 --> 02:41:47.819 align:start position:0%
that that won't pass inspection and then
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
some outdated clinical equipment but
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise no
 
02:41:53.450 --> 02:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
all right so there are a lot of people
 
02:41:56.690 --> 02:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
in the crowd still is there anyone here
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
that wanted to speak on any of these
 
02:41:58.620 --> 02:41:59.929 align:start position:0%
that wanted to speak on any of these
subjects

02:41:59.929 --> 02:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
subjects
 
02:42:02.450 --> 02:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
we're open to public comment I'm not
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
seeing anyone wanting to speak Mr Ripple
 
02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
what did you have for us I'm just going
 
02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
to comment that if you were so inclined
 
02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
you could do a quick first run through
 
02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 today
 
02:42:14.030 --> 02:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if you want to do that now
 
02:42:17.929 --> 02:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:20.210 --> 02:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'm I'll I'll take
 
02:42:22.730 --> 02:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
comments from division three how do you

02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
minutes in you at least to talk about
 
02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:28.610 align:start position:0%
minutes in you at least to talk about
hp2

02:42:28.610 --> 02:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
hp2
 
02:42:31.309 --> 02:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
well I'm just saying at least
 
02:42:33.650 --> 02:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
do you got it you got it yeah I'd like
 
02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
to get started on I mean per from my I
 
02:42:38.110 --> 02:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
would like to hear more about it but
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think we can finish it
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
no I'm just I'm just trying to figure
 
02:42:46.429 --> 02:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
out if you want to quit and go home
 
02:42:48.830 --> 02:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's what that was my nice way of
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
asking that five o'clock okay okay
 
02:42:54.170 --> 02:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:42:57.469 --> 02:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
um so that that one
 
02:42:59.389 --> 02:42:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative money
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so just moments ago in our
 
02:43:03.710 --> 02:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
emails we received notice from Janet
 
02:43:05.929 --> 02:43:05.939 align:start position:0%
that the public hearing on house bills
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%

reps Hall I may add
 
02:43:38.990 --> 02:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:42.950 --> 02:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
2PM in reps Hall on the 13th
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.399 --> 02:43:48.889 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:43:48.889 --> 02:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:43:50.809 --> 02:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
I think we're running a little late I
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
just introducing the bills
 
02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:56.450 align:start position:0%
just introducing the bills
yeah

02:43:56.450 --> 02:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay well good
 
02:44:02.270 --> 02:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
um can anybody comment on go ahead on
 
02:44:04.490 --> 02:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
what that how that works what that looks
 
02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
like who does the presenting what's
 
02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
expected of us if anything
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
just listen
 
02:44:16.010 --> 02:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
we're there to listen yeah it's a
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the governor's budget
 
02:44:21.650 --> 02:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
so just like any other Bill the public
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
come and speak to that bill I mean
 
02:44:28.010 --> 02:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
obviously you could ask questions but
 
02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
people will come and speak and they'll
 
02:44:32.690 --> 02:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
speak to certain sections of the budget
 
02:44:34.849 --> 02:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't know why I'm remembering
 
02:44:40.370 --> 02:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
sitting in rep Paul with with the big
 
02:44:43.370 --> 02:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
book of HP two items
 
02:44:46.370 --> 02:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
thinking that I had to speak to every
 
02:44:49.070 --> 02:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
hb2 item in front of the division that's
 
02:44:51.230 --> 02:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
the presentation that we do of our
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
budget when when it leaves here
 
02:44:57.710 --> 02:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
the finance committee has to do a
 
02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
presentation to the Full House
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
so then once we've got our documents all
 
02:45:06.530 --> 02:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
written and together then we do a
 
02:45:09.170 --> 02:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
presentation to the Full House
 
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay so that I remember that
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
Auditorium with the AstroTurf
 
02:45:17.929 --> 02:45:17.939 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay yeah that's where we
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
were okay very good
 
02:45:20.399 --> 02:45:21.710 align:start position:0%
were okay very good
um

02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
do you want to S would do you have
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
something to hand out on hp2 or what do
 
02:45:27.469 --> 02:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
you want to do how do you want to do
 
02:45:30.590 --> 02:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
that well I don't so I already emailed
 
02:45:32.690 --> 02:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
around although I don't have hard copies
 
02:45:35.690 --> 02:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
with me uh a brief summary that I
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
produced of division three House Bill 2
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
sections and I think I've handed out
 
02:45:42.590 --> 02:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
maybe not to everyone yet uh the
 
02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
Department's somewhat more detailed
 
02:45:46.190 --> 02:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
summary of hb2 sections so if you don't
 
02:46:14.590 --> 02:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:16.610 --> 02:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:46:19.849 --> 02:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
over here Mr chair
 
02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to be in another meeting
 
02:46:23.929 --> 02:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm okay if you guys continue without
 
02:46:25.969 --> 02:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
me I'm fine with that and we can catch
 
02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
up later
 
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:37.130 --> 02:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
this this is not even a scheduled work
 
02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
session we're about to do so we're not
 
02:46:41.090 --> 02:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
going to come anywhere near any
 
02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
decisions I think we're just going to
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
socialize these no that's fine I I don't
 
02:46:47.510 --> 02:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
expect that we're exacting anything and
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of these are going to be
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
rediscussed on Monday now that we're in
 
02:47:24.290 --> 02:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:26.450 --> 02:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
so if everybody has that document I
 
02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:37.370 --> 02:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh so so I can get started with this and
 
02:47:39.170 --> 02:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
I think I would ask Nathan to speak to
 
02:47:40.969 --> 02:47:40.979 align:start position:0%
some of the appropriation sections in
 
02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
particular because
 
02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
they aren't very detailed and I don't
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily know the rationale behind
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
them so I won't be able to offer much
 
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:53.570 --> 02:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
so the first section that pertains to
 
02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
division three
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
is section 49 which is on page 20 of the
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
bill and that's a 1.5 million dollar
 
02:48:04.130 --> 02:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
appropriation fiscal 23 for juvenile
 
02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:16.849 --> 02:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:18.530 --> 02:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not specific to the
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
governor's commission it's it's an
 
02:48:22.730 --> 02:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
appropriation to HHS
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
so Nathan I don't know if you have any
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
comments to add on that one
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I've I've coordinated with Katya
 
02:48:30.290 --> 02:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
Fox the director for Behavioral Health
 
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
and we will have more information on
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
this this was not included in our agency
 
02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
budget this was added during the
 
02:48:44.929 --> 02:48:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:47.090 --> 02:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
go ahead I was going to ask a quick
 
02:48:49.309 --> 02:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
question what um
 
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
division would this be under that would
 
02:48:53.929 --> 02:48:53.939 align:start position:0%
or does this go to
 
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
an agency
 
02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um so I I believe the division for
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health would most likely
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
manage these funds um if if an
 
02:49:04.849 --> 02:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
appropriation was was made we would
 
02:49:07.130 --> 02:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
likely go through either an RFP or an
 
02:49:10.670 --> 02:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
RFA or an rfg process
 
02:49:14.809 --> 02:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:16.730 --> 02:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
okay and the next section that pertains
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
to division three is on page
 
02:49:22.190 --> 02:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
31. so if we have questions we want the
 
02:49:24.410 --> 02:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
department to be able to come back on to
 
02:49:26.750 --> 02:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
answer should we talk about them now you
 
02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
think I would yeah if you have questions
 
02:49:30.290 --> 02:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
now Okay so
 
02:49:33.230 --> 02:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
so this is a brand new program I believe
 
02:49:36.650 --> 02:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
I've not seen adolescent peer-to-peer
 
02:49:38.590 --> 02:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
grief counseling ever
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
so I I think we probably need a
 
02:49:48.410 --> 02:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'll say briefing that would rationalize
 
02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
or Justify this program because I've
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
never seen it before
 
02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
in any context and I and the kinds of
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
things I'd be curious is uh you know how
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
would we identify who would be eligible
 
02:50:03.670 --> 02:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
aren't there already
 
02:50:06.110 --> 02:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
programs in place that are supposed to
 
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
do most of this uh what kind of
 
02:50:11.090 --> 02:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
evaluation metrics would we impose so
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
that we would have some idea of the kind
 
02:50:16.130 --> 02:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
of workload we could handle how would we
 
02:50:18.889 --> 02:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
have any metrics on Effectiveness I I
 
02:50:20.990 --> 02:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
just I'm just curious about this as a
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
pro as a program
 
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
sure and uh and and again I'll I'll have
 
02:50:28.429 --> 02:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
the the team come back and um we'll also
 
02:50:29.570 --> 02:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's an evident
 
02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:31.750 align:start position:0%
evidence-based program as well
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:33.170 align:start position:0%
evidence-based program as well
[Music]

02:50:33.170 --> 02:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm gonna say it is and it probably
 
02:50:37.130 --> 02:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
is and they're going to say that they
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
could send us the evidence and I'm never
 
02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
going to read it anyways so if they
 
02:50:43.790 --> 02:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
could just summarize it uh keep it tight
 
02:50:47.330 --> 02:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
you know like 15 minutes I think
 
02:50:49.070 --> 02:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to do it are there any
 
02:50:52.010 --> 02:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
other questions here representative erf
 
02:50:54.170 --> 02:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
do you think five minutes
 
02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay there's a lot in hp2 if they come
 
02:50:58.490 --> 02:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
back and talk about all these at 50
 
02:51:00.290 --> 02:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
minutes a pop are going to be
 
02:51:02.690 --> 02:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
spending the evening some evening all
 
02:51:05.690 --> 02:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
next okay so the next one is section 77
 
02:51:11.929 --> 02:51:11.939 align:start position:0%
which is on page 31 of the build and
 
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is actually an appropriation of Das
 
02:51:15.950 --> 02:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of constructing a sununu
 
02:51:17.570 --> 02:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
center replacement this is 10 million
 
02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
dollars in fiscal 23. on this one I
 
02:51:22.370 --> 02:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
might suggest that if the committee ends
 
02:51:24.530 --> 02:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
up passing a version of House Bill 49
 
02:51:26.570 --> 02:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
that this could just come out
 
02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
come out or be reduced I mean because
 
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes I hear people talk about belts
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
and suspenders you know well
 
02:51:39.170 --> 02:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
possibly but it's 10 million dollars
 
02:51:41.150 --> 02:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee will have to
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
account for in its budget so if you
 
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
could if you could reduce it in here it
 
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
would uh it would be a savings that
 
02:51:48.110 --> 02:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
would really help you so is my math
 
02:51:51.650 --> 02:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
right that I think if we've got 21.6 and
 
02:51:55.490 --> 02:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
49 and we've got 15 we're hoping to get
 
02:51:57.290 --> 02:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
from federal money that we're really
 
02:51:58.809 --> 02:51:58.819 align:start position:0%
only talking about
 
02:52:01.870 --> 02:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
6.6 million General funds
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
6.6 and I'm also wondering if and I know
 
02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
there are two amendments out there to
 
02:52:08.690 --> 02:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
house bill 49. Each of which contain
 
02:52:10.130 --> 02:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
different language relative to the
 
02:52:13.610 --> 02:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation I'm wondering if
 
02:52:15.469 --> 02:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
there could be a third version that
 
02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
potentially tweaks that language to
 
02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
require uh
 
02:52:22.490 --> 02:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
that the full 21.6 million come from
 
02:52:24.610 --> 02:52:24.620 align:start position:0%
arpa even if that means go for
 
02:52:27.410 --> 02:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
reallocating some of the existing arpa
 
02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:31.490 align:start position:0%
reallocating some of the existing arpa
projects

02:52:31.490 --> 02:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:44.870 --> 02:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
next is section 89 on page 33 which is
 
02:52:45.950 --> 02:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
roughly a two million dollar
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation in fiscal 23 for the
 
02:52:51.290 --> 02:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
granite United ways administration of
 
02:52:52.730 --> 02:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
the recovery friendly workplace
 
02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:55.610 align:start position:0%
the recovery friendly workplace
initiative

02:52:55.610 --> 02:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:58.969 --> 02:52:58.979 align:start position:0%
okay so somebody who has been around
 
02:53:01.610 --> 02:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
longer on this ought to give me some
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
history I I understood that when we
 
02:53:06.769 --> 02:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
established the governor's Commission on
 
02:53:09.650 --> 02:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs that we
 
02:53:12.950 --> 02:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
identified a source of funds from the
 
02:53:16.130 --> 02:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
sale of alcohol and that and that they
 
02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
get a big bunch of money and that
 
02:53:20.090 --> 02:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to within that
 
02:53:22.370 --> 02:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
commission allocate that money to
 
02:53:25.090 --> 02:53:25.100 align:start position:0%
various things that was meant to be
 
02:53:28.190 --> 02:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
outside of the general fund's budget
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
process but yet here we are with the
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
general funds request this seems to be
 
02:53:36.650 --> 02:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
something new and different and a red
 
02:53:39.889 --> 02:53:39.899 align:start position:0%
flag what what am I missing okay is my
 
02:53:41.450 --> 02:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
assumption correct that this would be on
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
top of anything that the governor's
 
02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:55.010 --> 02:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
then I I have nothing further to add I
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
think you're right it would be on top of
 
02:53:58.130 --> 02:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
the five percent of liquor profits
 
02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
allocated to the governor's commission
 
02:54:03.230 --> 02:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
and and I I heard a rumor I think that
 
02:54:05.929 --> 02:54:05.939 align:start position:0%
this is money that may have previously
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
come from the hospital Association and
 
02:54:10.429 --> 02:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
they're withdrawing their support I
 
02:54:12.650 --> 02:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
don't think this particular money is but
 
02:54:15.370 --> 02:54:15.380 align:start position:0%
the funds appropriated in house bill one
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh would fall into that category yes
 
02:54:22.190 --> 02:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay do you have something Mr White sure
 
02:54:26.269 --> 02:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so um and then representative the
 
02:54:28.130 --> 02:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
governor's commission as part in
 
02:54:30.530 --> 02:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
agreement that predates my time
 
02:54:32.690 --> 02:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
um was has been funded with with a
 
02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
hospital donation so every six months uh
 
02:54:38.870 --> 02:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
the association provides a five million
 
02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
dollar donation the last one that we are
 
02:54:46.730 --> 02:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
scheduled to receive is December of 2023
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
um so for the remaining six months of
 
02:54:51.769 --> 02:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 24 and all of c
 
02:54:55.490 --> 02:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
fiscaler 25 we do not have the standard
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:03.710 --> 02:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
just kind of related question I I get
 
02:55:06.290 --> 02:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
that but is this also a program that
 
02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
will be the governor program that you
 
02:55:09.290 --> 02:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
guys did not put into your budget or
 
02:55:11.570 --> 02:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
where did this come from this was not
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
included in our agency submission okay
 
02:55:15.769 --> 02:55:15.779 align:start position:0%
so I might suggest we do what you just
 
02:55:17.870 --> 02:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
asked on the first one which is maybe we
 
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
need to hear what the why we should be
 
02:55:21.469 --> 02:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
including this at all the five minute
 
02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
thing at some point
 
02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
who would we ask for that I I mean I I
 
02:55:29.809 --> 02:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
would take an initial email explaining
 
02:55:32.269 --> 02:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
why the state should pay for something
 
02:55:35.210 --> 02:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
that has been done through charitable
 
02:55:37.130 --> 02:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
work of our hospitals
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
no I don't think those are related
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
things are they
 
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily I I mean I I could
 
02:55:46.370 --> 02:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
talk to the governor's office to see um
 
02:55:48.650 --> 02:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
if they if they have the um you know the
 
02:55:50.510 --> 02:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
ability just to give us a written
 
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
statement uh to get to get your to your
 
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
question behind this
 
02:55:56.450 --> 02:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
02:55:59.150 --> 02:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
so back to section 49 yes that was
 
02:56:00.530 --> 02:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
something the governor threw in there he
 
02:56:01.790 --> 02:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
wants that out he wants that whatever
 
02:56:03.889 --> 02:56:03.899 align:start position:0%
that is and we don't know what it is I
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
was talking about 80 now no no I
 
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
understand I just want to draw a
 
02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
parallel so do we know what this is or
 
02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
is it a similar sort of thing we don't
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
know what it is only the governor knows
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
what it is so so I think this is another
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
one where I would want to bring uh the
 
02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
director from division for Behavioral
 
02:56:18.530 --> 02:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
Health to speak to the committee a
 
02:56:19.849 --> 02:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
little bit more about this this is
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
outside of my my knowledge area but
 
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
isn't this something that the behavioral
 
02:56:26.870 --> 02:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
health division didn't initiate this is
 
02:56:29.809 --> 02:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
a governor-initiated item is it not I
 
02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you say that yes yes
 
02:56:36.110 --> 02:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't ask the division to
 
02:56:38.389 --> 02:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
justify something they didn't invent why
 
02:56:40.010 --> 02:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we just ask the governor's
 
02:56:42.530 --> 02:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
office on what their rationale for this
 
02:56:44.510 --> 02:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
is can can we just get an email from
 
02:56:46.670 --> 02:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
them since their time is busy sure we
 
02:56:49.790 --> 02:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
can do that too okay all right now it's
 
02:56:51.530 --> 02:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
not that I don't want to listen to our
 
02:56:53.809 --> 02:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
division but I don't want to put them in
 
02:56:55.790 --> 02:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
a spot where they're having to justify
 
02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
something they didn't think of
 
02:57:01.429 --> 02:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
do you have a question there go ahead I
 
02:57:02.690 --> 02:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
think you're right I think it should be
 
02:57:04.370 --> 02:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
the governor's office to tell us about
 
02:57:08.570 --> 02:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
I think for any of these that were
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
initiated initiated by the governor's
 
02:57:13.309 --> 02:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
office rather than the department we
 
02:57:14.750 --> 02:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
could include them in a list and ask the
 
02:57:17.690 --> 02:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
governor's office to justify them
 
02:57:20.269 --> 02:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate that and accept that
 
02:57:20.279 --> 02:57:23.510 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate that and accept that
recommendation

02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
so the next item is section number 99 on
 
02:57:28.730 --> 02:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
page 36.
 
02:57:30.590 --> 02:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
this is again an appropriation to the
 
02:57:32.809 --> 02:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission of 1.5 million in
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
each year 24 and 25. for the purpose of
 
02:57:37.610 --> 02:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
providing Student Assistance programming
 
02:57:46.190 --> 02:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:48.050 --> 02:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
so is this the same sort of thing as a
 
02:57:52.250 --> 02:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:56.269 --> 02:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
so same idea this this is It's violating
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
to me the fundamental principle of how
 
02:57:59.929 --> 02:57:59.939 align:start position:0%
we set up this commission to begin with
 
02:58:01.550 --> 02:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
that it was supposed to be funded by
 
02:58:05.210 --> 02:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
alcohol funds and it's not meant to be a
 
02:58:07.550 --> 02:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
target for General funds so if we're
 
02:58:09.410 --> 02:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
going to break that precedent I'd really
 
02:58:16.610 --> 02:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:18.590 --> 02:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
okay the next section
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
that I had but maybe better addressed by
 
02:58:22.610 --> 02:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
division two
 
02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
um is on page 53 it's section 151 which
 
02:58:27.290 --> 02:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
moves from HHS to the Department of
 
02:58:28.969 --> 02:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
Safety the responsibility to conduct
 
02:58:30.650 --> 02:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
inspections of residential care and
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
health facilities licensed I'm confused
 
02:58:35.809 --> 02:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
I was getting ready to hear about 212
 
02:58:37.809 --> 02:58:37.819 align:start position:0%
section 212.
 
02:58:40.670 --> 02:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's next on your list so I I had
 
02:58:45.230 --> 02:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
identified section 151 on page 53 as a
 
02:58:47.990 --> 02:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
division three issue however I think
 
02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
division two wants to address it and I
 
02:58:51.889 --> 02:58:51.899 align:start position:0%
think Nathan's fine with division two
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
addressing it
 
02:58:56.090 --> 02:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
um so if you're okay with that I'm okay
 
02:58:58.730 --> 02:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
with it I'm perfectly happy letting
 
02:59:02.990 --> 02:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
so in that case we will move on to
 
02:59:09.050 --> 02:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
section 212 on page 76. which
 
02:59:10.730 --> 02:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
appropriates funds for the Choose Love
 
02:59:12.170 --> 02:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
program which I believe is something
 
02:59:13.550 --> 02:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:59:15.170 --> 02:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
first approved by the fiscal committee
 
02:59:17.269 --> 02:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
as well as two related classified
 
02:59:17.279 --> 02:59:24.950 align:start position:0%
as well as two related classified
positions

02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:26.330 --> 02:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question
 
02:59:29.210 --> 02:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
please thanks I remember this being
 
02:59:31.610 --> 02:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
um the legislature passed it last year I
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
remember there was a little bit of
 
02:59:37.490 --> 02:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
pageantry around it or some women in the
 
02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:38.690 align:start position:0%
pageantry around it or some women in the
gallery

02:59:38.690 --> 02:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
gallery
 
02:59:40.849 --> 02:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
would it is this shouldn't this have
 
02:59:43.010 --> 02:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
gone into hb1
 
02:59:45.250 --> 02:59:45.260 align:start position:0%
if it was something that was
 
02:59:49.070 --> 02:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
legislatively passed and
 
02:59:51.050 --> 02:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
02:59:52.490 --> 02:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this currently
 
02:59:54.230 --> 02:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
resides within the governor's office was
 
02:59:55.849 --> 02:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
in the within the executive branch and
 
02:59:57.290 --> 02:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of different ways that
 
02:59:59.030 --> 02:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
you could transfer a program and
 
03:00:01.849 --> 03:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to do it statutorily
 
03:00:03.590 --> 03:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and you know you you could move the
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
class lines which would what you would
 
03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
see you know coming out of hb1 so if we
 
03:00:09.889 --> 03:00:09.899 align:start position:0%
can't you know cut out the class line
 
03:00:11.330 --> 03:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
within the executive branch and move
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
that over that would be one component of
 
03:00:13.439 --> 03:00:14.150 align:start position:0%
that over that would be one component of
it

03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:00:16.670 --> 03:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the surrounding RSA
 
03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
behind this
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
um or or whether that would be required
 
03:00:20.690 --> 03:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
if it came through fiscal then there
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
likely isn't any so I mean I think hb2
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
is a vehicle that could be used for this
 
03:00:25.319 --> 03:00:31.010 align:start position:0%
is a vehicle that could be used for this
purpose

03:00:31.010 --> 03:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
so this is School curriculum and it's
 
03:00:35.690 --> 03:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
being administered through the
 
03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:00:41.809 --> 03:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
how how does it reach students I
 
03:00:43.010 --> 03:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to go through the
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so just to be
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
clear this is transferring the program
 
03:00:50.210 --> 03:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
to HHS to Public Health Services where
 
03:00:52.670 --> 03:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't currently reside
 
03:00:54.590 --> 03:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
um and and and this is this is the
 
03:00:56.210 --> 03:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
movement that's what this action is
 
03:00:58.130 --> 03:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
doing it's moving it to the department
 
03:01:00.230 --> 03:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
so I I can't speak to the specific
 
03:01:02.269 --> 03:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
programmatic nature but I can get Trisha
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
Tilley or some others here to to talk to
 
03:01:07.610 --> 03:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
that or I can get it to you in writing
 
03:01:09.530 --> 03:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
so it's already like in the Department
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
of Education and it's being moved to
 
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
Public Health or is it in it's somewhere
 
03:01:15.410 --> 03:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
in the department and it's just being a
 
03:01:17.030 --> 03:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
divisional move or something so there's
 
03:01:18.530 --> 03:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
two positions I believe they're both
 
03:01:20.809 --> 03:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
filled I believe the funding and the
 
03:01:22.429 --> 03:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
positions are coming from the governor's
 
03:01:22.439 --> 03:01:23.750 align:start position:0%
positions are coming from the governor's
office

03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:01:26.510 --> 03:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
to HHS
 
03:01:29.330 --> 03:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
all right thank you yep
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
I I I think I'd be open to reading an
 
03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:33.170 align:start position:0%
I I I think I'd be open to reading an
email

03:01:33.170 --> 03:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
email
 
03:01:35.870 --> 03:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
explanation sure
 
03:01:37.910 --> 03:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
anyone disagree with that Representative
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
no I'm just I just Googled very quickly
 
03:01:41.750 --> 03:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Choose Love program and
 
03:01:43.010 --> 03:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
their page is under the Department of
 
03:01:43.020 --> 03:01:44.269 align:start position:0%
their page is under the Department of
Education

03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
Education
 
03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious how it ended up in
 
03:01:50.330 --> 03:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
DHHS but
 
03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
if it's curriculum I don't know that the
 
03:01:54.290 --> 03:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
department should touch it
 
03:01:56.510 --> 03:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's not like the department is an
 
03:01:59.210 --> 03:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
expert on love
 
03:02:01.250 --> 03:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
I like the description where it says no
 
03:02:04.910 --> 03:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
cost and they want 250 000 for it for no
 
03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:06.590 align:start position:0%
cost and they want 250 000 for it for no
cost

03:02:06.590 --> 03:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:07.809 align:start position:0%
cost
okay

03:02:07.809 --> 03:02:07.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:16.370 --> 03:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
so the next section is section 213
 
03:02:19.070 --> 03:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
which allows HHS to fill unfunded
 
03:02:20.750 --> 03:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
positions during the biennium provided
 
03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
that expenditures do not exceed the
 
03:02:24.290 --> 03:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
amount appropriated for personnel costs
 
03:02:25.790 --> 03:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
at this point I think this is
 
03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
boilerplate the department has had it
 
03:02:29.210 --> 03:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
for the last several budget sessions
 
03:02:30.710 --> 03:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
there may have been one or two in there
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
where it was removed but in general
 
03:02:34.610 --> 03:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
they've had it for the better part of
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years and there are a couple
 
03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
of other agencies that have had this as
 
03:02:40.370 --> 03:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
well periodically I think safety and
 
03:02:41.929 --> 03:02:41.939 align:start position:0%
transportation have had versions of it
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:50.809 --> 03:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
I would be curious to see
 
03:02:52.610 --> 03:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years or at least the last
 
03:03:00.230 --> 03:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
so so can I just ask you about your
 
03:03:12.530 --> 03:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
workload right now Mr Ripple because
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
you're also supporting the Senate you're
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
supporting us you're supporting all uh
 
03:03:20.570 --> 03:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
how are you doing are you are you full
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
are you at 50 hours and more a week or
 
03:03:25.610 --> 03:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
where where are you
 
03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
probably but that's
 
03:03:28.730 --> 03:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
but that's no problem
 
03:03:30.950 --> 03:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay so are we getting close to Breaking
 
03:03:34.910 --> 03:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
you no no not just yet not yet okay keep
 
03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:38.630 align:start position:0%
you no no not just yet not yet okay keep
asking

03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:41.030 --> 03:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh the next section is section 214 which
 
03:03:42.769 --> 03:03:42.779 align:start position:0%
suspends the Foster grandparent program
 
03:03:44.450 --> 03:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
for the biennium
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
um again at this point this is sort of
 
03:03:49.130 --> 03:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
boilerplate I believe it was suspended
 
03:03:51.650 --> 03:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
beginning in the 1213 biennium
 
03:03:53.570 --> 03:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
and has not been funded since with one
 
03:03:55.370 --> 03:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
exception I think it was funded in the
 
03:03:57.410 --> 03:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
2021 budget however I think the
 
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
department did not actually expend that
 
03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:03.950 align:start position:0%
department did not actually expend that
appropriation

03:04:03.950 --> 03:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.170 --> 03:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
upon I saw this was um
 
03:04:09.410 --> 03:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
was still suspended this is this is this
 
03:04:10.849 --> 03:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
is different than what I was expecting
 
03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
is there another place somewhere where
 
03:04:15.910 --> 03:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
we killed the or suspended the the uh
 
03:04:18.769 --> 03:04:18.779 align:start position:0%
the Foster grandparent program or is
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
that a different program
 
03:04:24.830 --> 03:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
the grand Foster program or something
 
03:04:27.290 --> 03:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
03:04:29.450 --> 03:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
say again
 
03:04:30.889 --> 03:04:30.899 align:start position:0%
there are some other suspensions if
 
03:04:33.230 --> 03:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's what you're asking
 
03:04:35.690 --> 03:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
okay I thought this was
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
the way I'm reading this is this is an
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
unsuspension and they're going to want
 
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
right so usually what they we do is we
 
03:04:43.309 --> 03:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
suspend it for the biennium so they said
 
03:04:44.690 --> 03:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
we suspended for the last for the
 
03:04:46.010 --> 03:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
current biennium and this is saying
 
03:04:48.889 --> 03:04:48.899 align:start position:0%
suspended for the next biennium okay
 
03:04:50.510 --> 03:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just not reading it right
 
03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
then as a newbie can I just ask a
 
03:04:55.309 --> 03:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
question why would you do that
 
03:04:58.130 --> 03:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
why are we not do we not have a foster
 
03:05:00.130 --> 03:05:00.140 align:start position:0%
grandparent program anymore pretty much
 
03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
there isn't one currently as it hasn't
 
03:05:04.370 --> 03:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
been operational for the last 10 years
 
03:05:06.050 --> 03:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
but I think as with a couple of other
 
03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
areas here the appetite hasn't
 
03:05:09.290 --> 03:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily been there to suspend it
 
03:05:11.870 --> 03:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
outright to repeal it outright okay so
 
03:05:13.130 --> 03:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
the legislature has just ended up
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
suspending it for the biennium instead
 
03:05:17.090 --> 03:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
so pending legislation to repeal the
 
03:05:19.610 --> 03:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
program this is just what you do yeah
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thanks that's what gets done I
 
03:05:24.769 --> 03:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
don't like doing that if it's a program
 
03:05:26.750 --> 03:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't think we're ever going to
 
03:05:29.330 --> 03:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
turn back on I just as soon turn this
 
03:05:32.269 --> 03:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
hb2 item into an outright repeal and be
 
03:05:34.490 --> 03:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
done with it we can do that
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
go ahead the program exists we just
 
03:05:39.230 --> 03:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
aren't giving it any
 
03:05:39.240 --> 03:05:41.090 align:start position:0%
aren't giving it any
funding

03:05:41.090 --> 03:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:05:43.849 --> 03:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
we weren't funding the whole thing it's
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's a program that exists in New
 
03:05:49.070 --> 03:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the um
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
the state was making a small
 
03:05:54.769 --> 03:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
contribution to it it's got a federal
 
03:05:57.950 --> 03:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
funds United Way funds but it still
 
03:05:59.570 --> 03:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
exists there are still Foster
 
03:06:02.090 --> 03:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
grandparent programs and there are
 
03:06:04.010 --> 03:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
people who would like to see the state
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
once again engaging in funding part of
 
03:06:06.600 --> 03:06:07.610 align:start position:0%
once again engaging in funding part of
it

03:06:07.610 --> 03:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:06:09.950 --> 03:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
next the next section is essentially the
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
same thing but for the congregate
 
03:06:16.250 --> 03:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
housing and Services Program it's also
 
03:06:18.830 --> 03:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
suspended for the biennium and has been
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
for approximately the last 10 years
 
03:06:22.969 --> 03:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
again the one exception being it was
 
03:06:25.010 --> 03:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
funded in the 2021 budget but the
 
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:38.160 --> 03:06:41.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:06:41.870 --> 03:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:45.170 --> 03:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
so the next section is section 216 which
 
03:06:47.090 --> 03:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
increases the income eligibility for
 
03:06:49.969 --> 03:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
elderly and adult clients clients under
 
03:06:51.769 --> 03:06:51.779 align:start position:0%
the social services block grant each
 
03:06:53.809 --> 03:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
January by the percentage amount of any
 
03:06:55.490 --> 03:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
cost of living increase in Social
 
03:06:57.889 --> 03:06:57.899 align:start position:0%
Security benefits again I would say by
 
03:07:00.110 --> 03:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
this point this is boilerplate It's
 
03:07:01.550 --> 03:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
appeared in the last several trailer
 
03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:04.730 align:start position:0%
appeared in the last several trailer
bills

03:07:04.730 --> 03:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:07.969 --> 03:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
celebrating more than two
 
03:07:07.979 --> 03:07:09.349 align:start position:0%
celebrating more than two
yes

03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:07:11.090 --> 03:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
again I could I could take a look at the
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
history but it's been at least two okay
 
03:07:15.290 --> 03:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
well but more than two more than two I
 
03:07:18.170 --> 03:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's it has to be okay I'll check though
 
03:07:26.690 --> 03:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.429 --> 03:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
so as you're looking at it and thinking
 
03:07:30.830 --> 03:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
about it if there's an if there's
 
03:07:33.170 --> 03:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
another long-term solution to this like
 
03:07:35.929 --> 03:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
legislation introduced next January or
 
03:07:37.730 --> 03:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
something which you would you please cue
 
03:07:40.910 --> 03:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
me in on that because I I would like us
 
03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
to be working towards cleaning up hb2
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
and reducing the amount of burden on it
 
03:07:46.560 --> 03:08:00.710 align:start position:0%
and reducing the amount of burden on it
okay

03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
in fact this is the kind of thing that
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:08.690 --> 03:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
remove the stipulation that it's for the
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
biennium only it could be made permanent
 
03:08:12.650 --> 03:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the consequences if
 
03:08:14.510 --> 03:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
any of that would be but it would be a
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative norgren would would you
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
all maybe caucus at some point and talk
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
about whether or not you'd be open to
 
03:08:28.190 --> 03:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
I I'd rather fix things longer than
 
03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:35.450 align:start position:0%
I I'd rather fix things longer than
shorter

03:08:35.450 --> 03:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.450 --> 03:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
the next section is always confusing
 
03:08:41.269 --> 03:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's section 217 which delays until July
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
1st of 25 the prospective repeal and
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
reenactment of RSA 135 C13 which is
 
03:08:49.969 --> 03:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
relative to access to the state's Mental
 
03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
Health Services System and this is
 
03:08:54.710 --> 03:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
essentially a cost savings measure it
 
03:08:56.450 --> 03:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
allows Community Mental Health Centers
 
03:09:00.590 --> 03:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
to to assess the need of prospective
 
03:09:03.889 --> 03:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
clients and it requires them to work
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
within the confines of the available
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:16.790 --> 03:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
have copies of the uh
 
03:09:19.070 --> 03:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
relevant statute if anybody wants to see
 
03:09:19.080 --> 03:09:20.630 align:start position:0%
relevant statute if anybody wants to see
those

03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:09:23.929 --> 03:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
I I saw a representative nodding so I
 
03:09:26.410 --> 03:09:26.420 align:start position:0%
think we're I'm okay with this
 
03:09:28.910 --> 03:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
anyone have an issue
 
03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:09.469 --> 03:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
can we hold on this
 
03:10:13.010 --> 03:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
can can we hold on this
 
03:10:18.349 --> 03:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
03:10:23.630 --> 03:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
why don't we try to set a time we will
 
03:10:25.730 --> 03:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
go until
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
what would you suggest like quarter to
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
five four Thirty sold quarter to five it
 
03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:32.510 align:start position:0%
five four Thirty sold quarter to five it
is

03:10:32.510 --> 03:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:10:38.290 --> 03:10:38.300 align:start position:0%
4 30. I hear 4 30. do I hear a 428
 
03:10:45.349 --> 03:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:47.870 --> 03:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
the next section is another suspension
 
03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
this is section 218 which suspends
 
03:10:52.130 --> 03:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
direct and indirect graduate medical
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
education payments for the biennium
 
03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
so this is another one this is the
 
03:10:59.090 --> 03:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
candidate for us to just change it from
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
a biennium to a permanent suspension
 
03:11:03.950 --> 03:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
it could potentially if there if the
 
03:11:06.290 --> 03:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
appetite exists for that what do you
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
what do you think representative norgren
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
to you do do you want to think about it
 
03:11:11.690 --> 03:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
do you want to caucus on that and come
 
03:11:15.650 --> 03:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:15.660 --> 03:11:21.889 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:11:21.889 --> 03:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:24.290 --> 03:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
all right I I just would like like I
 
03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
said I just would like to make as many
 
03:11:29.090 --> 03:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
of these cleanups as possible yeah thank
 
03:11:29.100 --> 03:11:31.070 align:start position:0%
of these cleanups as possible yeah thank
you

03:11:31.070 --> 03:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:11:33.650 --> 03:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
same thing with Section 219 which
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
suspends catastrophic Aid payments to
 
03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:45.650 --> 03:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to section 220 this do
 
03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know how many um
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
bienniums that's been in there
 
03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
I can take a look I think the vast
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
majority of these have been in here
 
03:12:02.090 --> 03:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:04.090 --> 03:12:04.100 align:start position:0%
does Nathan have something
 
03:12:08.809 --> 03:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
yes so um I I'd ask the the team just to
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at these past two section
 
03:12:14.690 --> 03:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
218 graduate medical education payments
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
the best that we could identify that
 
03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
they were last paid in 2006
 
03:12:21.769 --> 03:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
um we believe it was roughly 1.58
 
03:12:24.290 --> 03:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
million dollars and then for the
 
03:12:27.050 --> 03:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
suspension of catastrophic Aid to
 
03:12:27.060 --> 03:12:28.849 align:start position:0%
suspension of catastrophic Aid to
hospitals

03:12:28.849 --> 03:12:28.859 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
03:12:33.410 --> 03:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
um we we found this back in 2011
 
03:12:35.450 --> 03:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
um it was about three million dollars
 
03:12:50.410 --> 03:12:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
section 220 relates to the Medicaid to
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
schools program that says that in the
 
03:12:56.450 --> 03:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
event Appropriations are insufficient
 
03:13:00.170 --> 03:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
HHS May accept and expend funds uh
 
03:13:02.030 --> 03:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds through fiscal
 
03:13:04.070 --> 03:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
and report to fiscal and the types of
 
03:13:05.630 --> 03:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
assistance the department is providing
 
03:13:07.010 --> 03:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
to school districts to ensure
 
03:13:09.530 --> 03:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
eligibility for reimbursement this first
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
appeared in the trailer Bill two years
 
03:13:14.030 --> 03:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
ago and I think it was in response to uh
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
a pressing issue at the time of school
 
03:13:18.349 --> 03:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
districts not receiving reimbursement
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
for certain services so this section was
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
added so two questions do we think it's
 
03:13:26.809 --> 03:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
really still needed or is it just a
 
03:13:28.550 --> 03:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
Vestige uh
 
03:13:29.929 --> 03:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
tool now
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I would ask Nathan to weigh
 
03:13:32.760 --> 03:13:34.370 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I would ask Nathan to weigh
in

03:13:34.370 --> 03:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
can you verify if this is still a
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
current need or might we have just
 
03:13:41.809 --> 03:13:41.819 align:start position:0%
inherited this out of habit sure we we
 
03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
had requested it um just because a lot
 
03:13:46.429 --> 03:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
of work has been done on the Medicaid
 
03:13:48.469 --> 03:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
the schools program to get guidance out
 
03:13:50.570 --> 03:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
there to the schools to try to bring
 
03:13:52.250 --> 03:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
more on
 
03:13:54.110 --> 03:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
um and and we had requested this just
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
due to the unknown surrounding that I
 
03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
think the important thing to remember
 
03:13:59.929 --> 03:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
about this is the the match the
 
03:14:01.969 --> 03:14:01.979 align:start position:0%
non-federal match portion is coming from
 
03:14:04.190 --> 03:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
the local school district so that so the
 
03:14:06.290 --> 03:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
the there's no general fund costs
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
associated with this it would simply
 
03:14:09.769 --> 03:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
allow us to get the matching federal
 
03:14:13.070 --> 03:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
dollars for the Medicaid costs would we
 
03:14:15.650 --> 03:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
be putting the local school districts on
 
03:14:18.910 --> 03:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
the hook for mandatorily accepting
 
03:14:22.610 --> 03:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
a match obligation or would they still
 
03:14:24.670 --> 03:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
have the discretion locally to
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
participate or not this this really
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that question I I don't
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
see any mandate here this is more so
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
just the the financial mechanism that we
 
03:14:37.309 --> 03:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
would use to draw down those federal
 
03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
funds in the event that what we have
 
03:14:44.150 --> 03:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
budgeted exceeds the amount so
 
03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:48.410 align:start position:0%
budgeted exceeds the amount so
okay

03:14:48.410 --> 03:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.170 --> 03:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
next is section 221 which makes funds
 
03:14:53.090 --> 03:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the division of Medicaid
 
03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
services non-lapsing until June 30th
 
03:14:57.650 --> 03:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
2025 and treats them as restricted
 
03:14:59.090 --> 03:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
revenue for the purpose of funding
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Managed Care throughout the
 
03:15:03.230 --> 03:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
biennium this was done in the 2021
 
03:15:04.969 --> 03:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
trailer bill but I wouldn't describe it
 
03:15:07.250 --> 03:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
as boilerplate at all and it does have a
 
03:15:09.230 --> 03:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
general fund lapse impact and I think
 
03:15:12.349 --> 03:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
Nathan I think you said in your
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
summary that it would be about 5 million
 
03:15:17.389 --> 03:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
that absent this section would otherwise
 
03:15:20.090 --> 03:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
last to the general fund yes that that
 
03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
is correct um we we don't see this as a
 
03:15:25.190 --> 03:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
long-term hb2 provision by any means um
 
03:15:28.010 --> 03:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
this is this is to address the uh record
 
03:15:29.690 --> 03:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
number of individuals that we do have
 
03:15:31.969 --> 03:15:31.979 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid today within the
 
03:15:35.090 --> 03:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
state where a little over 250 000
 
03:15:36.650 --> 03:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
um which is significantly higher than
 
03:15:40.250 --> 03:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
our historical figures we we do you know
 
03:15:41.809 --> 03:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
we continue to have a number of unknowns
 
03:15:43.550 --> 03:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
and we've talked to and Henry lippman
 
03:15:45.050 --> 03:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
talked about this when he came before
 
03:15:45.060 --> 03:15:46.309 align:start position:0%
talked about this when he came before
you

03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:15:48.530 --> 03:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
um and and we will be having the 6.2
 
03:15:50.690 --> 03:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
phase out here to five percent then two
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
and a half and then one and a half
 
03:15:55.370 --> 03:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
percent of the additional fmap and we we
 
03:15:57.950 --> 03:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
had requested this just to attempt to
 
03:15:59.450 --> 03:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
address any of those potential
 
03:15:59.460 --> 03:16:01.010 align:start position:0%
address any of those potential
fluctuations

03:16:01.010 --> 03:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
fluctuations
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
um that we may see resulting from the
 
03:16:04.730 --> 03:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
appeal process as we disenroll
 
03:16:07.490 --> 03:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
individuals because if they appeal they
 
03:16:10.010 --> 03:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
have the ability to continue to main on
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
remain on uh the Medicaid roll until we
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
can uh formally final is that appeal
 
03:16:20.330 --> 03:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
to just put it out there I I think I'm
 
03:16:22.429 --> 03:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
okay with this unless somebody has a
 
03:16:24.050 --> 03:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
reason to tell me why we shouldn't be
 
03:16:27.250 --> 03:16:27.260 align:start position:0%
but carrying the 5 million over
 
03:16:35.630 --> 03:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:38.210 --> 03:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
okay and next is section 222 which
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
requires hhs2 if necessary submit a
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid State Plan amendment to
 
03:16:44.210 --> 03:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
establish and provide preventative
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
health care benefits under the Medicaid
 
03:16:48.889 --> 03:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
Program and this section is new and has
 
03:16:59.170 --> 03:16:59.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
go ahead I was just going to ask if
 
03:17:03.469 --> 03:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
Nathan went to tell us what exactly it's
 
03:17:06.410 --> 03:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
doing sure I I will do my best and while
 
03:17:08.570 --> 03:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
you're doing it I'm wondering how much
 
03:17:10.429 --> 03:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
redundancy there is because we have
 
03:17:14.210 --> 03:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
other smoking secession programs
 
03:17:14.220 --> 03:17:15.349 align:start position:0%
other smoking secession programs
the

03:17:15.349 --> 03:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:19.550 --> 03:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
so I I can't answer that question what I
 
03:17:22.250 --> 03:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
can do and the information here
 
03:17:24.769 --> 03:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
coordinated with Henry and Dr Ballard on
 
03:17:24.779 --> 03:17:27.410 align:start position:0%
coordinated with Henry and Dr Ballard on
essentially

03:17:27.410 --> 03:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
um we we likely have funds within the
 
03:17:33.230 --> 03:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget
 
03:17:37.150 --> 03:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
um to to pay for these types of
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based programs that have based
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
on the studies that you that you see
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
there that have reduced long-term and
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
short-term costs in other states and so
 
03:17:48.769 --> 03:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
this provision would allow us to engage
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
in those
 
03:17:52.969 --> 03:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
so I may have some comments when we talk
 
03:17:54.590 --> 03:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
about it it's a national preventative
 
03:17:58.370 --> 03:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
task force something that has influenced
 
03:18:01.010 --> 03:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of health insurance that I'm
 
03:18:02.269 --> 03:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
there's something called the national
 
03:18:04.969 --> 03:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
preventative task force that
 
03:18:04.979 --> 03:18:05.830 align:start position:0%
preventative task force that
um

03:18:05.830 --> 03:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:09.889 --> 03:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
provides uh recommendations on items and
 
03:18:11.929 --> 03:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
services that are other themselves cost
 
03:18:15.650 --> 03:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
effective requires certain insurance
 
03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
companies to pay for them without copay
 
03:18:19.550 --> 03:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:18:22.750 --> 03:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
or outside the deductible boat
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it when it comes up
 
03:18:27.710 --> 03:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
just because there's no budgetary impact
 
03:18:31.250 --> 03:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct
 
03:18:35.330 --> 03:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
there's no budgetary no dollar impact
 
03:18:37.670 --> 03:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
Our Hope though is that the long-term
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
budget impact will be a net reduction in
 
03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
costs due to
 
03:18:43.969 --> 03:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
by having this
 
03:18:46.130 --> 03:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
available as opposed to by it costing
 
03:18:56.809 --> 03:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.809 --> 03:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
okay next is section 223 which
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
appropriates funds for the purpose of
 
03:19:02.929 --> 03:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
operating the sununu center throughout
 
03:19:05.210 --> 03:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
the biennium and this is slightly over
 
03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
11 million in general funds per year
 
03:19:11.809 --> 03:19:11.819 align:start position:0%
so so my general thought on this is that
 
03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
it would be great to get Mr ribson to
 
03:19:16.490 --> 03:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
explain what this how he got to this or
 
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
how you and he got to this number you
 
03:19:20.450 --> 03:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
know how what what kind of personnel are
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
we looking at what kind of other
 
03:19:25.010 --> 03:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
operating expenses are we looking at so
 
03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
so normally we would have that when this
 
03:19:29.389 --> 03:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
is an HP one but we don't have it here
 
03:19:32.570 --> 03:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
in hp2 so it's that level of detail I
 
03:19:35.630 --> 03:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
think we could we still need to get to
 
03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:37.130 align:start position:0%
think we could we still need to get to
sure

03:19:37.130 --> 03:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:19:39.469 --> 03:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead my question would be would
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't we move this once we get
 
03:19:43.309 --> 03:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
that level of detail wouldn't we move
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
this into hb1
 
03:19:48.650 --> 03:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
I I I mean my my hope would be that we
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
can get this into the operating budget
 
03:19:52.370 --> 03:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
it was in hp2 because of the because of
 
03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
the the pending closure date
 
03:19:55.849 --> 03:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
um I can submit a change request that
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
gives you that class line level detail
 
03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:05.210 --> 03:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
well that would do it for me I I just
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
would add that we need we would still
 
03:20:09.410 --> 03:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
need to have somebody come back and talk
 
03:20:11.389 --> 03:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
to us specifically about what's in there
 
03:20:13.969 --> 03:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
I I I if we're going to start moving
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
towards this therapeutic model I I want
 
03:20:20.510 --> 03:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
to understand how we would be doing this
 
03:20:23.090 --> 03:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
and that and this biennium and what it's
 
03:20:25.910 --> 03:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing just change the positions that are
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay next is section 224 which allows
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
the department to transfer between and
 
03:20:41.570 --> 03:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
create certain class lines in order to
 
03:20:43.730 --> 03:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
comply with Federal standards and this
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.650 --> 03:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
03:20:57.309 --> 03:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
um you heard me previously talk about
 
03:21:00.050 --> 03:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
sub-recipients and contractors and
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
you've seen a number of movements within
 
03:21:04.130 --> 03:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
within our class lines where they go
 
03:21:08.570 --> 03:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
from 74 to 102. um when we when we
 
03:21:11.450 --> 03:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
budget uh before we get a grant we may
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily know
 
03:21:15.769 --> 03:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
how are we going to use all of those
 
03:21:19.190 --> 03:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
dollars and sometimes plans change out
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the federal funds sometimes we have
 
03:21:22.969 --> 03:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
to have any of our any of our budgets
 
03:21:25.490 --> 03:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
approved by the feds sometimes through
 
03:21:27.290 --> 03:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
those conversations plans can change
 
03:21:30.530 --> 03:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
based on their directives and so we have
 
03:21:33.050 --> 03:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
to account for whether whether something
 
03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
should be accounted for in a class 74 if
 
03:21:38.330 --> 03:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's a sub-recipient and and that can
 
03:21:40.130 --> 03:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
still be a contract it could be a grant
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
it could be an mou or some other type of
 
03:21:44.330 --> 03:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
agreement or whether it's a contractor
 
03:21:46.849 --> 03:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
under the federal definition into CFR
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
200 through 331 so we were we were
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
asking uh the the for consideration as
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
to whether we would have the ability to
 
03:21:57.650 --> 03:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
move the funds within those class lines
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
and not come back through fiscal and I
 
03:22:01.849 --> 03:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
will defer to you on on the Judgment
 
03:22:01.859 --> 03:22:10.130 align:start position:0%
will defer to you on on the Judgment
there

03:22:10.130 --> 03:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:13.429 --> 03:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay next is section 225 which moves
 
03:22:15.889 --> 03:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
from HHS to safety the responsibility to
 
03:22:17.450 --> 03:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
conduct preliminary inspection and
 
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
approval for new facilities or
 
03:22:20.950 --> 03:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
alterations to existing facilities
 
03:22:24.290 --> 03:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
licensed under RSA 151 and Nathan is
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
this similar to the one that we've
 
03:22:27.769 --> 03:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
gifted to division two
 
03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
um that's not okay
 
03:22:32.389 --> 03:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
let's move it so we don't deal with it
 
03:22:33.530 --> 03:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
in this budget
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
well well so so it's it's pretty I'd
 
03:22:38.990 --> 03:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
like to think it's pretty simple anyway
 
03:22:41.330 --> 03:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
um so during during the uh Governor's
 
03:22:43.130 --> 03:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
phase Melissa saying sir when she was
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
here she's our chief legal officer we
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
abolished two positions within the
 
03:22:49.969 --> 03:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
department and the department of safety
 
03:22:52.190 --> 03:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
created two positions in their
 
03:22:54.349 --> 03:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
Department we reduced our general funds
 
03:22:55.730 --> 03:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
I don't remember off the top of my head
 
03:22:57.490 --> 03:22:57.500 align:start position:0%
I think it was close to
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
237 thousand dollars and they don't
 
03:23:02.269 --> 03:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
quote me on it but I can come back with
 
03:23:04.429 --> 03:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
it and they increase their General funds
 
03:23:06.950 --> 03:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
to cover those positions and the reason
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
that we were doing that is because these
 
03:23:12.229 --> 03:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
functions uh that that are being
 
03:23:14.090 --> 03:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
transferred here from the Department of
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to the
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety make a lot more
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
sense to be within the functions of the
 
03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and less less So
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Health and
 
03:23:24.490 --> 03:23:24.500 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
03:23:28.729 --> 03:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
the section 155 that division two is
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
taking up um I don't quite know the
 
03:23:32.330 --> 03:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
origin of that but I've spoken with the
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office I've spoken with Steve
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
Lavoy at the department of safety and
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're all in agreement that that should
 
03:23:37.080 --> 03:23:40.809 align:start position:0%
we're all in agreement that that should
go

03:23:40.809 --> 03:23:40.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
so we now have less than five minutes
 
03:23:45.710 --> 03:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to finish this so is
 
03:23:48.610 --> 03:23:48.620 align:start position:0%
there any one specific or too specific
 
03:23:51.229 --> 03:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
items that are so critical that we
 
03:23:53.330 --> 03:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
should jump ahead and and talk about
 
03:23:56.290 --> 03:23:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:59.929 --> 03:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
stay in the order okay
 
03:23:59.939 --> 03:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
stay in the order okay
next

03:24:01.190 --> 03:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:24:04.729 --> 03:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
okay section 226 delays until July 1st
 
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
of 2025 implementation of the health
 
03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
care facility work workplace violence
 
03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
prevention program
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
so I've had Outreach from from from uh
 
03:24:16.849 --> 03:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
the constituents not understanding why
 
03:24:19.130 --> 03:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
this is being delayed so so we'll have
 
03:24:21.229 --> 03:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
to talk about and uh Mr chairman you
 
03:24:23.570 --> 03:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
might recall this it's you know what
 
03:24:25.729 --> 03:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
this program is it's the one okay all
 
03:24:27.950 --> 03:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
right I think it should not be delayed
 
03:24:27.960 --> 03:24:30.229 align:start position:0%
right I think it should not be delayed
personally

03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
personally
 
03:24:30.239 --> 03:24:31.250 align:start position:0%
personally
if

03:24:31.250 --> 03:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:24:32.809 --> 03:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
I want to under I want to understand
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
what why we're doing the delay what the
 
03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
what was described to me by a lobbyist
 
03:24:40.729 --> 03:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
is that the DHHS did not believe that
 
03:24:42.650 --> 03:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
they had the manpower to implement this
 
03:24:45.050 --> 03:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
program in this biennium
 
03:24:47.330 --> 03:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
and it was my understanding when we set
 
03:24:51.710 --> 03:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
this program up that it it wasn't it was
 
03:24:54.910 --> 03:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
a basically a
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association LED and coordinated
 
03:25:01.610 --> 03:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
effort I don't know why we're doing we
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
have to worry much about Manpower so if
 
03:25:05.929 --> 03:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
they could come back and explain that to
 
03:25:08.750 --> 03:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
us I I never thought this was a program
 
03:25:11.229 --> 03:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
that the state needed to mandate I I
 
03:25:15.170 --> 03:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:17.330 --> 03:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and and if the department can't
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
support it I wouldn't mind delaying it
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
another two years let the hospital
 
03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
Association figure out how to run the
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
program that they wanted
 
03:25:28.130 --> 03:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
I I the the challenge that we've had is
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
is um when the legislation passed is
 
03:25:32.330 --> 03:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
there was no appropriation or or
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
positions tied to that
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
um if if the committee wishes I can
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
certainly put forward a request for
 
03:25:39.889 --> 03:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
Staffing for that purpose that was done
 
03:25:39.899 --> 03:25:41.750 align:start position:0%
Staffing for that purpose that was done
intentionally

03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
intentionally
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
that wasn't an accident that was you
 
03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
know the the hospital Association thinks
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
this is important it's a Manpower issue
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
that they're having a problem with this
 
03:25:54.410 --> 03:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
is their solution you know and so we the
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that we didn't appropriate or
 
03:25:58.849 --> 03:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
put positions on it was an intentional
 
03:26:01.130 --> 03:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
thing at the time go ahead I'm just
 
03:26:02.690 --> 03:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
curious so your recollection is it
 
03:26:03.889 --> 03:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
actually does require I thought it was
 
03:26:05.929 --> 03:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
like a monthly meetings or something
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
that they were holding is actually
 
03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
requires the department to do something
 
03:26:13.130 --> 03:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
I do not remember the exact final
 
03:26:15.769 --> 03:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
legislation I I remember the general
 
03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
brush on this was
 
03:26:21.769 --> 03:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
if deer Hospital Association if you want
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
this don't ask the state to make it
 
03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory don't ask us to be spending
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
money on it you do it as essentially a
 
03:26:31.610 --> 03:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
volunteer program and we will give you
 
03:26:34.190 --> 03:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
the sort of the official recognition
 
03:26:36.170 --> 03:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
that you're doing something but we're
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
not going to be accountable for it
 
03:26:41.330 --> 03:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
can I ask Mr replica go ahead Mr but
 
03:26:42.650 --> 03:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
could you just look up the law not right
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
now but let us know what the RSA is or
 
03:26:46.610 --> 03:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
the chapter Law whatever so we just we
 
03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
could read and understand what in fact
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to do or not do yep I'll
 
03:27:05.450 --> 03:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:05.460 --> 03:27:07.729 align:start position:0%
 
wrong

03:27:07.729 --> 03:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:27:11.030 --> 03:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
we can take our house bill too and when
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
we're bored in the house floor tomorrow
 
03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
we can
 
03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:16.819 align:start position:0%
we can
again
