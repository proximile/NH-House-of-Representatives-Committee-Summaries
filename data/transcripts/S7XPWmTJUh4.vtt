their discussion would you like to speak

to your motion representative yokela
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
from the testimony um
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that this
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
um work
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
can be had without the study commission
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
and so i don't believe that it's
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
necessary and so that's why
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
we should oppose the
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative long
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah there there was
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
all the early learning childhood centers
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
the kids counts they were all in favor
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
evidently there's a grant
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
for the office of early childhood i got
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
here uh so i think
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
i think this is a follow-up to a
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
grant to put this bill together or to
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
put this idea together
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a great idea it covers
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
people from birth to eight which a lot
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
of it covers birth to five i believe or
 
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.830 align:start position:0%
of it covers birth to five i believe or
six

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh so i thought the birth to eight was
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
good cover birth to five is what it is
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
what child care normally covers um so i
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
i i feel it's a um
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know i i feel it's a good bill and
 
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.950 align:start position:0%
you know i i feel it's a good bill and
uh

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
as far as finance i don't let them
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
decide whether they want to fund it or
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
not or how much to fund it so
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be supporting uh i'm going
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be opposed to that about to pass
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative grossman
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:14.710 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
so i just want to point out that this is
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan issue early childhood um
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
and these early years are incredibly
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
research has shown that there's a
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
significant return on investment for
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
these years and there is a cost savings
 
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.509 align:start position:0%
these years and there is a cost savings
there

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
and i can attest to being a parent of a
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
child with special needs that
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
those early years are so significant
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
into capturing
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
a disability
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
and helping a child to get on track
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
potentially so that they can participate

thank you madam chair and just to hear
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
from the testimony um
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
my concern and while his fiscal's job
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
maybe not necessarily ours and more at a
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
policy standpoint but the biggest issue
 
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
that i had with this was that there's a
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but that they're not asking
 
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.630 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but that they're not asking
for

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
anything it just seemed very confusing
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
so for me it was more form looking for
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
clarification and nobody could provide
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
that which is why i'm supporting motion
 
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.949 align:start position:0%
that which is why i'm supporting motion

thank you madam chair yes i do uh my
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
is there a second second seconded by
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
representative nelson would you like to
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
i would thank you um of concern
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
to me is
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
based um the enrollment-based billing
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
should continue unless a child exceeds
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
two weeks of consecutive absence from
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
the program without notification to the
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
provider regarding circumstances and
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
agreed upon return date i feel like this
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
framework could allow for children to be
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
absent several times a week and still be
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the program
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
causing unnecessary costs to the program
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
and possibly preventing space for
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
another child who is in need of care
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan child care
 
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.829 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan child care
scholarship

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:31.110 align:start position:0%
scholarship
i

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not following the uh being absent
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
a week
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
and still
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
using the reimbursement
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
i like the enrolled base reimbursements
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's why they have the two weeks
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
i think this is a way past it's due and
 
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.470 align:start position:0%
i think this is a way past it's due and
i'm

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
going to oppose the itl thank you madam
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
and and i'll just say that
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
i do wish that it wasn't two consecutive
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
weeks because i am very concerned
 
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.350 align:start position:0%
weeks because i am very concerned
that

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
people can keep their child children
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
home twice a week
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
and there's there's no repercussion it
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
has to be two full weeks and so by
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
keeping you know they could keep them
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
home three days a week and we're still
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
paying for it
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
and there's there's no you know
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
no repercussions to that there has to be
 
00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:30.470 align:start position:0%
no repercussions to that there has to be
accountability

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
and that's really my only issue
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
is that i'm just concerned i'm worried
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
about it being abused when when in
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
reality like was said there could be
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
another child that would be there five
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
days a week
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
and they're being they're losing that
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
spot because someone is you know
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
technically only sending their kids
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
twice a week but but
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
being paid for the full week that's
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
that's my issue with it
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.110 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
i i just want to speak to the concern
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
that you're having and that's a valid
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
concern that somehow
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
the spot would be lost um
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
but there is absolutely nothing in this
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill that a la that does it that says
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
that um child care providers who
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
very very much
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
want to serve their communities i hear
 
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.790 align:start position:0%
want to serve their communities i hear
from

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
um three in my area uh that they have
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
wait lists
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
they have absolutely incredibly long
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
weight lifts and
 
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.629 align:start position:0%
weight lifts and
they

00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
i think that very very
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
small and very small
 
00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
small and very small
possibility

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
of potential
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
abuse and it is it is a small
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of potential it's so far out
 
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.710 align:start position:0%
possibility of potential it's so far out
there

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.069 align:start position:0%
there
abuse

00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
does not weigh equally
 
00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:10.870 align:start position:0%
does not weigh equally
to

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
the wait lists that exist now
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the families who desperately need
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
this service right now
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
and um the you know the
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
overwhelming reason that
 
00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:26.629 align:start position:0%
overwhelming reason that
parents

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
are looking for
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
quality affordable
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
sustainable uh child care
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
is that they work
 
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.389 align:start position:0%
is that they work
and

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
they're not they're they are looking to
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
have a place where their child will be
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
cared for
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
learning while they're there in a safe
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
environment so that they can go to work
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
that this is not
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is child care this is not
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
babysitting so that you can go out to
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
dinner and this is not somewhere to put
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
your child so that you can go play
 
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:03.590 align:start position:0%
your child so that you can go play
tennis

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
tennis
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
this these these are working families
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
who are struggling
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill has an eligibility
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
um which is only 250 percent of poverty
 
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
um which is only 250 percent of poverty
level

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
so this isn't this is not a a pla i
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't see this bill as being something
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.190 align:start position:0%
that is
inviting

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
the kind of
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
overt fraud that
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
being suggested i didn't use the word
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
fraud i i am extrapolating from the
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
the phrase that you use keep their kids
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
home for three weeks
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't say three weeks i said two to
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
three weeks i said two to three days a
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
week two to three days a week okay
 
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.029 align:start position:0%
week two to three days a week okay
okay

00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
and and just so you see where i'm coming
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
from is i have worked in a child care
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
facility before and i've seen this i've
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
seen it where parents
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
will say they're bringing their kid the
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
full week and only bring them three days
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
a week
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
or bring them two days a week right and
 
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.950 align:start position:0%
or bring them two days a week right and
and

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
when we knew we had other
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
parents out there that needed this but
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
we were already obligated to this spot
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm saying and i don't
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
want people to not be able to afford
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
child care
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure we have people
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
using it that
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
use it always rather than a two-week
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
span of being out consecutively before
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
be booted from the program
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so this this is
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
a three-month pilot program
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh which includes a report filed
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
september 1st 2022
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh which includes the absentee rate so
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's a three-month pilot program let's
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
let's look at the absentee rate is what
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're asking for
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
so i you know i
 
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.789 align:start position:0%
so i you know i
i

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
i agree that
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
parents may do that hold their kids on
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
when i had my son for the week
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
i kept the moon um you know uh so so
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's a pilot program
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
it it has it has some uh absolute
 
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
it it has it has some uh absolute
um

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
intent on moving forward with the
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
and in three months you could review the
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
absentee rate and we could adjust it in
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
three months or or actually it's uh
 
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:48.670 align:start position:0%
dhhs um
 
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.750 align:start position:0%
dhhs um
[Music]

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know could could make some
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know before they continue it or they
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
may say this is not working so
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
you know it's a three-month attempt i i
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
don't see where that could hurt okay
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative de simone
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
considering that i have
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
two grandchildren who
 
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.070 align:start position:0%
two grandchildren who
were

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
in both cases
 
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.390 align:start position:0%
in both cases
when

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
one particular child care facility or
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
another was looked into
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
the statement from the
 
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
the statement from the
childcare

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
childcare
 
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.190 align:start position:0%
childcare
was

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
was
well

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
we have somebody who doesn't bring their
 
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.070 align:start position:0%
we have somebody who doesn't bring their
children

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
any more than one or two days a week but
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
they've paid for the full week so we
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
cannot give you a slot
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
until they no longer pay for that full
 
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:47.669 align:start position:0%
until they no longer pay for that full
week

00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
with a scholarship program
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
the scholarship will pay for the whole
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
week so you do have
 
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
week so you do have
children

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
who are in dire need of child
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
care three
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
maybe four days a week
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
and because the scholarship is
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
paying for all those days the child care
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
facility has no alternative but to keep
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
that slot
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
for the child who's not
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
attending and that scares me that
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
the state would be paying
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
for a service
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
that is not being given to a child in
 
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.669 align:start position:0%
that is not being given to a child in
need

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative all chiller
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for the
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify some of my
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
earlier statements and i want to
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
i want to begin by reiterating what
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative long said is that what we
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
are debating right now we are debating a
 
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.470 align:start position:0%
are debating right now we are debating a
a

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
a pilot program
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
um and this pilot program would
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
essentially be running through the
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
summer which is a an incredibly
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
difficult time for families to find
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
child care because we
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
we know well school is not in session
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
now we also know because we heard and i
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
am going to base all of my
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
um statements right now on the actual
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
i have my own experiences as does
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
everyone most of the people here
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
which our brings our biases to the table
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
but if we look just at the
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
bless you
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
from the bureau of child development and
 
00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:44.230 align:start position:0%
from the bureau of child development and
collaboration

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
that the ccdf is under utilized
 
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:48.950 align:start position:0%
that the ccdf is under utilized
so

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
the ccdf the child care development fund
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary funds are being under
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
utilized and this is a pilot program to
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
see if perhaps the way we approach child
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
care in the state of new hampshire
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
could use a tweaking could use a new
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
method could use some fresh eyes and we
 
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.710 align:start position:0%
method could use some fresh eyes and we
have

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
ccdf money
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
to allow us the flexibility
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
to look at that
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
that one of the challenges
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
um we heard this from the earl from
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
early learning new hampshire that they
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
have identified
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
that the challenge
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
for us is that the government recommends
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
based versus attendance base
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
typical policy as they as was brought
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
into testimony is if you are enrolled
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
you pay whether you attend or not
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
and this pr this program
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
ensures that
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
parents particularly now who are
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
struggling with
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
having children in and out of school
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
because of covet exposures having covert
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
exposures themselves
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
that they get to keep their slot and the
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
child care facility doesn't lose income
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
that is a bonus and what we heard
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
is that putting enrollment-based
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
billing in place is a form of primary
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
prevention and we heard this
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
from rebecca watkowski the policy
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
director at new futures and during the
 
00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:28.230 align:start position:0%
director at new futures and during the
pandemic

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire actually used this model
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
to stabilize our child care industry
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we heard from child care providers
 
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
and we heard from child care providers
when

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
that money was being debated
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
that they really really really needed
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
the help
 
00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
the help
so

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
um i would
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
i would urge my colleagues
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
to give this pilot program a chance to
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
use the money that we have been given
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
from arbor the american rescue plan
 
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.269 align:start position:0%
from arbor the american rescue plan
money

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.149 align:start position:0%
money
has

00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:04.950 align:start position:0%
has
has

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds in it
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
for child care and development funds
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
like they are specific to this purpose
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
we are not pulling money out of general
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
care funds we are not pulling money away
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
from another program that the state of
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has already committed to
 
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.789 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has already committed to
funding

00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
we have the money to do exactly this
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
kind of work
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i would i would urge us to not
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
make the mistake of leaving federal
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
funds on the table
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
and not use them for the purposes of
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
which they were intended and give us a
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
chance to get some
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
heart some more hard data thank you
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%

thank you sorry i was just trying to
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
refresh my brain as i'm
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
i don't have my typical stuff so uh my
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
issue with this bill was um while i
 
00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.070 align:start position:0%
issue with this bill was um while i
understand

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
full-heartedly that
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
some of these non-profits might be
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
losing their umbrella policies and that
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
is unfortunate
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
in respect to uh
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
actually had a conversation with
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
somebody the other day about this and
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
that if we lose the iso foster care
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
providers it's a problem
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
but i don't necessarily think this is
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
the best solution
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
and establishing a commission is just
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of not something i want
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
to do at this time so that's why i
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion and we'll be
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%

and there was also
some

00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:18.470 align:start position:0%
concern about

um
while

00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
well uh the cr the law allows for them
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
to make adjustments as far as
 
00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
to make adjustments as far as
um

00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
because of those
 
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.509 align:start position:0%
because of those
uh

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's just said that the the court should
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
um allocate
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
allocate those and not get into
 
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.230 align:start position:0%
allocate those and not get into
um

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh or anything else kind of a thing uh
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
it was an open-ended uh statement as far
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
as like what else it could be
 
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.550 align:start position:0%
as like what else it could be
uh

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
like the court could be diving into as
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
far as
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
um these uh um additional
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
costs of
 
00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:40.950 align:start position:0%
costs of
of

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
variable expenses
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.389 align:start position:0%
variable expenses
and

and
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
so then there was
 
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.069 align:start position:0%
so then there was
um

00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
definitely about um
 
00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.550 align:start position:0%
definitely about um
1641

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
1641
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
or 1647 as far as the one point the
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
increase of available money
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
um which was not in this bill um there
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
was no increase of funds it was just
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
reallocating the funds and so
 
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
reallocating the funds and so
um

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
on line
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh determine
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.630 align:start position:0%
what the
heck

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
i've i've fixed this amendment i think
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
this is not the amendment that is
 
00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.670 align:start position:0%
this is not the amendment that is
correct

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%

i will withdraw the other motion uh
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
i will withdraw my second
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
from the first amendment and i will
 
00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:58.790 align:start position:0%
from the first amendment and i will
second

00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
amendment 1575-h
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you so what i was trying to get to
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
was on line uh
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
26 27 where
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
language does not increase the parental
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
support obligations and we have heard
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
both from the carson study and
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
even from the people that made the bill
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
originally that they want that um it
 
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.069 align:start position:0%
originally that they want that um it
cost

00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
more to have two households and so
 
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.510 align:start position:0%
more to have two households and so
um

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
what this seeks to do is
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
um the carson study just said um a
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
hundred and uh multiplied by 150 but i'm
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
just suggesting that we at least go up
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
to 120
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
of what the current support obligation
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
would be for the additional cost of
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
having two households and so
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
if um so this would be
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
meaning that there's more money
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
for um getting attributed to the
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
parental support obligation um
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
to to support the kids uh
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
um and that's what line 26 and 27 does
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
as far as that so that's one um thing
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
that was not currently in the bill
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
um and and also
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
um just
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know that there
 
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.870 align:start position:0%
uh you know that there
was

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know going from
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
only being
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
so what the bill did before was it tied
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
the hands of the judge so that he had to
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
make a whole bunch of findings to uh
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
to be able to make this offset and so
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
what i'm just saying is that um instead
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
of making all of those findings that he
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
just makes the finding that it's in the
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child and then
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
online um
 
00:52:48.559 --> 00:52:51.670 align:start position:0%
online um
uh

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
so and then and then we reiterate that
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
on line 31 and 32 of this amendment
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
which says if the difference if the net
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
the net
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
the difference method is not in the best
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
interest of the child the court may
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
order child support guideline amount or
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
another amount that is in the best
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
interest of the child so really we're
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
just getting to what is in the best
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
make that the amount that we need to pay
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
if that if the judge finds that you know
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the calculation is
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
and this that language was in the
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
original bill is that i didn't i didn't
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
make up that language but we're i'm just
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
saying what the
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
the court needs to say you know we
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
we took everything into consideration we
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
said this is in the best interest of the
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
child and we are suggesting a formula
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
but we are not holding that court to
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
that formula if it's not in the best
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
interest of the child is what this bill
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
does and so that's why i hope you will
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
support this amendment um and so thank
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative de simone
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:04.710 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative yokela and i went over
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:54:08.839 --> 00:54:10.630 align:start position:0%
the original bill
extensively

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
with the thought of what's in the best
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
and how is the child gonna monetarily
 
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.109 align:start position:0%
and how is the child gonna monetarily
benefit

00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
from the original bill and this
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment the changes that
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative yokela has made
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
which represent this
 
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.990 align:start position:0%
which represent this
amendment

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
clearly means that in the end the child
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
reaps the benefit
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
it takes the child's best interest
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
first and foremost
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
and that's why i
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh support this amendment
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:06.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
right out of the gate
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
just throws it all out the window so
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
if the nap difference method is not in
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child like
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're the whole point is to set up
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
a formula
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
that will benefit
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
the children or child
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
living in two spaces
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
and living um
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
integrating two parts of their life
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
into into
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
a you know trying to to build
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
healed over a fracture
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
we are trying to create
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
a rubric
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
the children are centered
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
in this process
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
not the parents
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
we need to leave space
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't i'm finding this
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
particular amendment hard to follow
 
00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:26.069 align:start position:0%
particular amendment hard to follow
i

00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
don't understand why the
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
the final
 
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.190 align:start position:0%
the final
uh

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.390 align:start position:0%
uh
phrasing

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
phrasing
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
essentially negates everything prior to
 
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.670 align:start position:0%
essentially negates everything prior to
it

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.349 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
so if i may i just in the original bill
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
that that same exact language is on line
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
15 and 16 of page 2.
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
that same exact language
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
i understand that but it's also
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
after that language
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
there are a series of
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
considerations that the court can
 
00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:04.150 align:start position:0%
considerations that the court can
consider

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm noticing in
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative yokela's amendment
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
that in lines
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
17 18 and 19 when child support is
 
00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:15.430 align:start position:0%
17 18 and 19 when child support is
adjusted

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
adjusted
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
a modification from the original bill
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
the court shall
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
allocate the cost of day care after
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
school programs vacation and summer care
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
unless the parties have agreed to an
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
allocation of these expenses so what
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
what this says to me is that the court
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
is now
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
shall now going to have to get involved
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
with what the actual costs of daycare
 
00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:46.549 align:start position:0%
with what the actual costs of daycare
are

00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
in the specific
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
geographical area that that
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
these parents live in and they may not
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
be in the same geographical area the
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
court is going to have to get involved
 
00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:58.870 align:start position:0%
court is going to have to get involved
with

00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know asking for
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
affidavits attesting to what after
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
school programs there are how much they
 
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.430 align:start position:0%
school programs there are how much they
cost

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
how much summer camp costs and so on and
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
so forth and what what the court is this
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
is setting up
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
um is that you know any parent that
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
wants to sign their kid up
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
for an after-school program is going to
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
have to go to court
 
00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:22.549 align:start position:0%
have to go to court
for

00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
the permission to unless it's been
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
previously granted and then if they if
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
isn't enough
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
um they're going to have to then go back
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
to court for those those at that extra
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
sign up fee at this
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
changing shell
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
really really really puts some um
 
00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:46.069 align:start position:0%
really really really puts some um
stringent

00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
bumpers on this that
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
it leaves it leaves no flexibility for
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
the court whatsoever and actually why
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
would the court want to be involved in
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things isn't the whole
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
point that we're trying to equalize
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
the child's um standard of living so
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to go to court every
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
time we want to sign up for soccer camp
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to go to court because
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
children are in two different daycares
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
it was that shall intentional
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative leo kelly i guess that's
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
what my question boils down to
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering are you confused when you
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
read the original bill because that
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
language is not changed in my amendment
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
that language precisely matches like
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
line r uh page two line three to five th
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
that exact wording is in the original
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
build so you're saying that the
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
amendment is confusing and maybe maybe
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
you're also confused about the original
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill and so maybe um you don't support
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
the original bill and so i guess do you
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
have an uh amended language that affect
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
that fixes the language on uh line page
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
two line three to five that you that you
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
had issues with in the original bill
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
well i i appreciate you
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
inquiring into my understanding of the
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
original bill and i do understand thank
 
01:00:07.839 --> 01:00:08.549 align:start position:0%
original bill and i do understand thank
you

01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
um but your shell
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
is after an elimination
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
of almost entire the entire page one of
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
so i didn't add that language that
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
language is in the current bill so i
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't understand how that language is
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
i guess that is my my
 
01:00:38.799 --> 01:00:40.150 align:start position:0%
i guess that is my my
question

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.710 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that that language is not changing so
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i can't i didn't write the la that
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
language i didn't so i can't comment on
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so just for
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
clarification the amendment replaces
 
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
clarification the amendment replaces
uh

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
section one
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
can you give line numbers that you're
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that all of section all of the
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
first page
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
through uh line five
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
through line five on page two
 
01:01:59.599 --> 01:02:00.390 align:start position:0%
through line five on page two
so

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.150 align:start position:0%
so
the

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
so the amendment replaces section one of
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
the bill so it would replace everything
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
through line 20
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
all the way from line one on the first
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
page to line 20 on the second page and
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
the and then line 22 23 24 25 26 or 25
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
would all stay the same and so this
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
would be replace that uh section one of
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
so it replaces everything
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
on page two to
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
line 20 is what it replaces
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
and then 21 right through 25
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's what section 1 is and then
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
16 years and i didn't realize there was
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
a section two or a one
 
01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.230 align:start position:0%
a section two or a one
um

01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right so so
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
i'm correct right
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
one replaces through
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
page two line 20.
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment replaces that
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes second section one yep
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i can give you kind of um
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
kind of uh a rundown of which
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
which language is in which part on the
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
original bill i guess if that would help
 
01:03:29.359 --> 01:03:30.789 align:start position:0%
original bill i guess if that would help
but

01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to
 
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.589 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to
nope

01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
nope
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
no i get it i'm just
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to look to see what was
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
the deleted
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
so um 18 19 and 20 are on the back side
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
of this page is the new roman numeral
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:52.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.720 --> 01:05:02.789 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
okay representative altschiller you had
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
or statement
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
yes i have a couple of questions so i
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
want to acknowledge that yes
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
the language in lines 31 and 32 of the
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
are in the original bill which is part
 
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.750 align:start position:0%
are in the original bill which is part
nine

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
and my objection is that
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
the the amendment
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
the rose out
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of stuff that we had
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
specifically put in
 
01:05:41.359 --> 01:05:42.789 align:start position:0%
specifically put in
to

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
that we're specifically there
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the children
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
um so the phrase
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply in the same way
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
let me explain
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the original bill on lines 21 22 and
 
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.430 align:start position:0%
in the original bill on lines 21 22 and
23

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
if with an adjustment the lower earning
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
parent is not able to meet the need
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
meet the cost of child raising in a
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
similar or approximately equal style to
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
that of the other parent the court shall
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.510 align:start position:0%
um
that

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
is not reflected in this amendment and
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
to take the
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
would be setting up one parent for
 
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.829 align:start position:0%
would be setting up one parent for
failure

01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
failure
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
which is detrimental to the child
 
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
which is detrimental to the child
and

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
should not we supporting
 
01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.829 align:start position:0%
should not we supporting
parents

01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
in order to keep the child's best
 
01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:49.670 align:start position:0%
in order to keep the child's best
interest

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
i i am still
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
i am still struggling with and maybe
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
you can help me understand why
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
it was important to
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
remove parts two
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
three and four out of the original bill
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
i think she was asking that was a
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:26.950 align:start position:0%
question um
so

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.069 align:start position:0%
so
their

01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:29.190 align:start position:0%
their
um

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
line 18 to 23 um
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
did on the original
 
01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.829 align:start position:0%
did on the original
bill

01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
m tied the hands of the judges to to not
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
just consider the best interest of the
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
child and so in the example that you
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
were saying on line 21 they are forced
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
to do something which they may determine
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
is not in the best interest of the child
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
and so what i'm saying is
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
stop we need to not tie the hands of the
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
judges that if they determine that this
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the child
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
then they should be able to make empower
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
the judges to say this is in the best
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
interest of the child this is the money
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
going to uh require and not go
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
um follow these rigid rules that don't
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
allow for flexibility when they are
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
making that judgment and so i think that
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
that um that uh
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
that both
 
01:08:21.759 --> 01:08:23.110 align:start position:0%
that both
uh

01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
the line eight eight to 23
 
01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.829 align:start position:0%
the line eight eight to 23
um

01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
on the original bill
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
the requirement
 
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.229 align:start position:0%
the requirement
that

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
they online 15 16 and 17 on page two
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
only let them do what is in the best
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
interest of the child in certain cases
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
and so what i'm saying is let's let the
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
judges do what's in the best issues of
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
the child in all the cases those are
 
01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.590 align:start position:0%
the child in all the cases those are
that's

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
that's
that's

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do with this
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative all chiller
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i'm beginning to
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
understand um
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
i think i'm going to understand some of
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
um

01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
what what i'm
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm struggling with here if i heard
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
you correctly
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
on the original bill
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
lines 17 18 19 20
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
if i heard you correctly did you just
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
said that those are not in the best
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
um and i would
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
i would that is that what you just said
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
that those
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
so the language on line 11 is saying
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of the child
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
so it's on the original bill thank you
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
on the original bill it says if it's in
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child and
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
then we're going to keep on deciding
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
stuff and so if it's in the best
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
interest of the child but not
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
doing um line
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
12 through
 
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.270 align:start position:0%
12 through
19

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
19
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
then the judge's hands are tied and they
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
cannot order that judgment
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
even though they determined on line
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
seven and eleven they said it isn't the
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
best insures a child and so why are we
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
limiting judges to to say no you you
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
have to find it's in the best interest
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
of the child and other things five other
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
things seven other things whether that
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
list be one thing or a hundred other
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
things i don't i don't um think that
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
that what we need to be focused on is
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of the
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
child if the judge determines that and
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
we have a bunch of of things both in the
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
parenting plan um
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
that he should be considering when he's
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
considering the best interest of the
 
01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.669 align:start position:0%
considering the best interest of the
child

01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
um that is
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
say what is in the best interest of the
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
child full stop
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have additional qualifiers i in
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
in some of the cases maybe those things
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
are part of the best interests of the
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
child but then it would be covered by
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
that best interest of the child if it's
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
not if those things being considered are
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of the child
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
then the judge has the flexibility to
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
not consider them so that is what i'm
 
01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.110 align:start position:0%
not consider them so that is what i'm
saying

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
so representative yokela along that that
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
where where is the best interest of the
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
so in the original bill
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
they don't define it in there either but
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
on lines
 
01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.630 align:start position:0%

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
shall be based on
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
the the court's
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
the adjustment of support
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
shall be based on written findings by
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
the court
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
or by agreement of the parties that the
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
adjustment is in the best interest of
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
the child
 
01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.990 align:start position:0%
the child
and

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
the adjustment of the income of the
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
lower earning parent enables that parent
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
to meet the costs
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
of child rearing
 
01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.590 align:start position:0%
of child rearing
so

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
it would seem that taking that out
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
removes um
 
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.870 align:start position:0%
removes um
removes

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
removes
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
a standard you know a living standard
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
for both houses if we want to if we are
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
if we are and it seems that with this
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
bill we are looking to
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
we are we're looking to create similar
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
living situations for each child so that
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
one child would not be
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
either living in poverty poverty or on
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
the brink of poverty
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
and one child you know living
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
extremely comfortably
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment that you've brought
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
forward throws that possibility out all
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
um is about best interest of the child
 
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.830 align:start position:0%
um is about best interest of the child
but

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment allows for
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child to be
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
at the judicial discretion of whatever
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
judge is sitting on the bench at that
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
moment and what we've done in the
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
original bill is to provide some
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
parameters saying that you sh that you
 
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.030 align:start position:0%
parameters saying that you sh that you
may

01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
please do you may consider the adequacy
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
of housing accommodations you may
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
consider access to nutrition you may
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
consider transportation if one
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
parent has a car and the other parent
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
does not have reliable transportation
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
you may consider access to technology
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
these are all things on line 17 that you
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
know if one parent is not able to afford
 
01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:55.350 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:56.870 align:start position:0%
to have
[Music]

01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
a reliable
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
broadband hookup at their house that
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
severely impacts how that child will be
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
able to access educational materials
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
particularly if they have to be homesick
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
or if we have
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
another response to a public health
 
01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
another response to a public health
crisis

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.750 align:start position:0%
crisis
so

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like the best interest
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the child is being addressed in the
 
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.270 align:start position:0%
of the child is being addressed in the
amendment

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
so much as the comfort level of the
 
01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.270 align:start position:0%
so much as the comfort level of the
parents

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.470 align:start position:0%
parents
and

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to avoid is setting
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and um
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the representative from
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
fremont my neighbor
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
for bringing forward this amendment one
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
thing and it's a common misconception
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
child support is not supposed to be used
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
to support the other parent
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
and we see time and time again
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
that that it's abused
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i have personal experience of child
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
support being abused
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
my mother abused the child support
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
from my father
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
and there were other underlying issues
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
there but
 
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.870 align:start position:0%
there but
we

01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
this best interest of the child uh is
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
not in the previous bill and is not in
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment so we're talking about
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
really not relevant
 
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.590 align:start position:0%
really not relevant
um

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
and uh i really think we need to get to
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh get get back to the basics here um
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
one parent
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
supporting two households the purpose of
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
child support is to support the child
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
not the other parent
 
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the premise
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
that child support should be used to
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
support the other child is absolutely
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and we should the other
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
parent thank you sorry
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
to support the other parent is
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely ridiculous and um this bill
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
does everything this amendment excuse me
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
does everything that we need to do
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
to um support the child and not the
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
so

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.750 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have a child support study going on
 
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.110 align:start position:0%
we have a child support study going on
that'll

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
that'll
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
go through 12 22 i believe so that'll be
 
01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.550 align:start position:0%
go through 12 22 i believe so that'll be
forthcoming

01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to getting rid of other
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
things well first of all i don't see
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
anything in here where we're supporting
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
another parent
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's a misnomer that's we get that
 
01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.630 align:start position:0%
that's a misnomer that's we get that
constantly

01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
from people saying that i'm supporting
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
i'm giving a child support check and
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
supporting my wife
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
and that's not what it is
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
and to the other things that's what we
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
constantly hear from parents coming here
 
01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.790 align:start position:0%
constantly hear from parents coming here
saying

01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
um i can't afford a house because i'm
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
paying too much money i can't afford
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
a better vehicle because i'm paying too
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
much money you know so those are the
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
other things in the
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
original bill that the judges would
 
01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.430 align:start position:0%
original bill that the judges would
consider

01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.750 align:start position:0%
consider
um

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that would help
 
01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.870 align:start position:0%
and i think that would help
with

01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
the payee
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
coming here stating
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
i you know i'm gonna eat beans
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
because i can't afford to eat
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
a hamburger
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
um you know so so the judge takes all of
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
that into consideration so removing
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
these other things i
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
i think hurts
 
01:17:34.719 --> 01:17:35.910 align:start position:0%
i think hurts
um

01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
with respect to um
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
finding the best
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
adaptive spot in both health for the
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
child i mean child support is having a
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
child living to the expectations so
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
if i make
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
250 000 a year and my ex-wife makes
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
40 000 a year my child's used to live in
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
a certain manner i'm going to anticipate
 
01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:02.229 align:start position:0%
a certain manner i'm going to anticipate
that

01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be paying
 
01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.950 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be paying
heavily

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
heavily
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
to keep that child in um
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know in that adaptive uh
 
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.950 align:start position:0%
you know in that adaptive uh
environment

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
i i uh
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
personal experience well i'm on my third
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
wife so
 
01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:20.950 align:start position:0%
wife so
uh

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
i guess my personal experience with
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
child scare too you know um you know so
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
i think leaving the other things in
 
01:18:33.679 --> 01:18:34.550 align:start position:0%
i think leaving the other things in
there

01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
i preferred that much better to have to
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
have the judge consider that may
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know because if it's
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know it has effect on a child
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:47.350 align:start position:0%
you know
uh

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to my dad's and i'm going
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
to sleep on a couch because he's paying
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
my mom too much money
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
then that ought to be a consideration
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.390 align:start position:0%
you know
so

01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.590 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
baltshiller

01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
turn it on you had it on
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay there we are
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so to be clear and um i
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
just in case there was any confusion
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no intention
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh on my part in
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
making any kind of a case
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
that child support is for the benefit of
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
the parents child support is for the
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
benefit of the children and as we put in
 
01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.270 align:start position:0%
benefit of the children and as we put in
statute

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
considering when the court shall
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
determine how to optimize use of the
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
parents combined incomes
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
to arrive at the best possible outcome
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
provided that the basic support needs of
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
the child or children are met so that is
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what we are talking about right
 
01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.310 align:start position:0%
exactly what we are talking about right
here

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
and um and in doing so it's important to
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
recognize that those children are under
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
the care and the custody of their
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
parents which is where they should be
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we want to support that as much as
 
01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.629 align:start position:0%
and we want to support that as much as
possible

01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
setting up one of the parents for
 
01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.070 align:start position:0%
setting up one of the parents for
failure

01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
failure
 
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.110 align:start position:0%
failure
through

01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
through legal
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
barriers is is antithetic to the what we
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
want to do to support children so i
 
01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.669 align:start position:0%
want to do to support children so i
would

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think that this amendment
 
01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:42.330 align:start position:0%
i think that this amendment
um

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:42.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.070 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
actually does it
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
does some damage to the
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
the original bill which we had worked so
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
very diligently on
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
it takes out
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know costs of child rearing in
 
01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:04.470 align:start position:0%
similar or appropriately equal styles so
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:06.390 align:start position:0%
similar or appropriately equal styles so
[Music]

01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
which speaks to what
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative long was saying and
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
my own personal experiences with child
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
support notwithstanding
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
that in the state of new hampshire we
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
have children who are living in poverty
 
01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.790 align:start position:0%
have children who are living in poverty
because

01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
they have they are in homes that have
 
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.629 align:start position:0%
they have they are in homes that have
experienced

01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
and experienced financial abuse
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
and this committee has heard a number of
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
testimonies to those exact
 
01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:43.270 align:start position:0%
testimonies to those exact
situations

01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.709 align:start position:0%
situations
and

01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
keeps the children's interests in the
 
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.470 align:start position:0%
keeps the children's interests in the
forefront

01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
forefront
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.149 align:start position:0%
 
1575

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
1575
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
actually dials back
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of the
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
children and i urge my colleagues to not
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
support amendment 1575 and support
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um so i wanted to just uh
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of of examples um one might be
 
01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.390 align:start position:0%
a couple of of examples um one might be
that

01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.270 align:start position:0%
that
the

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
the
parent

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
parent a has
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
um makes 250 000 a year and the parent b
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
makes 100 000 a year
 
01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:45.590 align:start position:0%
makes 100 000 a year
so

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
there in those examples it may they may
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
not be struggling to provide
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
a household for the child but maybe and
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
so they would not qualify under lines 12
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
and 13 however maybe there are medical
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
bills or some other reason that it is in
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child that this
 
01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.189 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child that this
um

01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
formula be be used but that under the
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
unamended language that would not be
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to be taken not be allowed to be
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
done because it did not fall under both
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
situations and so i um
 
01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:23.110 align:start position:0%
situations and so i um
i

01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
see where the um opposition is coming
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
from but i think that it's a
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding and that it is in fact
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
there are other reasons other than just
 
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.470 align:start position:0%
there are other reasons other than just
equalizing

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
equalizing
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
the parent the the households that
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
should come into consideration and
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
actually the governing
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
thing should just be the best interest
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
of the child and there's nothing in the
 
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.629 align:start position:0%
of the child and there's nothing in the
um

01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
in the language as written that
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
forbids the judge from considering
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
everything from line 12 to
 
01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:55.990 align:start position:0%
everything from line 12 to
23

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
um of the original bill that that can be
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
also assumed under the best interest of
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
the child if the court
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
believes that that is
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
something that they could consider
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the child thank
 
01:24:08.639 --> 01:24:10.629 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the child thank
you

01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative altschiller
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for clarification
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill does cover health care
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
coverage costs on page two line one and
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
what we have learned from the testimony
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
particularly from new hampshire legal
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
assistance that we heard on april 12
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
that the enumerations
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me the enumerations of um that
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
which may be considered but not limited
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
to those variables that are outlined on
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
the original bill as amended by the
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
senate on lines 28 29 and of page one
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
and lines one and two of page two
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
give the examples for the courts because
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
have had difficulty
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
which is why we're here in determining
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
what those things are so we are actually
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
putting into place
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
that which is asked for
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
so again health care costs
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
right there in the original bill not in
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
also uninsured health care costs and
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
other child-related expenses so putting
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
one child in um a babysitting or daycare
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
situation while attending to the medical
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
needs of an another child who may be
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
hospitalized that's all covered here in
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
the first bill
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate and is left out
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative ocala are we going to
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
debate all day or um until noon i think
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
that i felt like that was a good
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
stopping point no um i think that um
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
when i
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh i said
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
in my example i disagree with the um
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
the representative as far as them being
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
able to consider that thing because they
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
would have to stop at line 12 of the
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
amendment because if they if it did not
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
meet those qualifications they would not
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
be able to get into any other
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
adjustments the adjustment has to meet
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
the first two requirements and then the
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
judge's hands are tied and so i actually
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
argue that that is in fact not the case
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to deal with any
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
any adjustments on page two line one
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
because that would be part of an
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment assuming that they had
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
already ruled on the previous stuff that
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
was required um under
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
lines eight through twenty three so in
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
fact i completely disagree that they
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
would be able to make that adjustment so
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing then i'll have the
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're voting on ought to pass on the
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
