00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
of the low points are as follows 1967
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
the state encouraged political
 
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to join a Statewide
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system for teachers police
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
and firefighters and said it would
 
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.350 align:start position:0%
and firefighters and said it would
contribute

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
40% in 1977 State reduced its
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
35% 2009 an amendment to uh reduce the
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
state share to 30% in physical year
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
2010 then was an amendment to reduce the
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
state share to 25% in physical year
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
2011 however in 2009 Amendment restored
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
the state contribution to 35% in
 
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 align:start position:0%
physical year
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
2012 but in 2011 amendment to completely
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate the state contribution to zero
 
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
eliminate the state contribution to zero
yes

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
zero in 2022 HB
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
1417 for 75% restored passed the house
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
but Senate changed it to one year only I
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
know the towns and the schools
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
appreciated the one year they
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
got again town cities and schools were
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
asked to join the state retirement
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
system with the promise that the state
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
would help defay the employer costs when
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire retirement system was
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
formed in
 
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
1967 replacing four smallest separate
 
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems the state contributed
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
40% of the total employer costs the 75%
 
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.510 align:start position:0%
40% of the total employer costs the 75%
contribution

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
from 14 from hb1 1417 was for only one
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
year then it reverted back to
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
zero since the state R Gage promised the
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions have had to pay
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
for the state share of the employer cost
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
much of which has been downshifted to
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal and local school property tax
 
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
rates please pleas consider voting ought
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
to pass on HB 1279 to partially
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
reinstate the promise of the state to
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
the political
 
00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
subdivisions it would be provide much
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
Rel relief to political subdivisions
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
that help offset the need for increased
 
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.029 align:start position:0%
that help offset the need for increased
property

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
taxes hb1 1279 helps the average
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh thank you are there any
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question is
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1279 identical to last year's
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
50 it's identical to the one that was
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
changed last year
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
yes followup follow up thank you um are
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
you aware that um the house position on
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 50 is now in front of the
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
senate in the form of house bill
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
436 I know that the Senate does have a
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
house bill that's excuse me a bill that
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
is similar to the one that I had that
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
was changed
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes one more question thank you
 
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
um do you think it's productive to to
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
send the Senate sort of twice the the
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
same thing twice rather than uh you know
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
sort of make more work for them is that
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
more likely to get something passed or
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
or should we just leave it the way it is
 
00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:34.519 align:start position:0%
I think you should pass this the way it
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
is it's not not the same as what they
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
understand representative thank you Mr
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh first I just
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to applaud you for bringing this
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
forward again I know that at the end of
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
budget negotiations there was um
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
declarations from both sides of the
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
aisle that we would continue to work on
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
this this matter um and as you know the
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
end result was that uh our state donated
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
donated quite a bit of money towards the
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
tail of the retirement system Debt
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
Service um but I assume that this bill
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I have not had a chance to
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
read through word for word but from my
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
memory the last time it was proposed
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
there was not a Debt Service um portion
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
to this bill it's just for The Upfront
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
Al a is that correct that's
 
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:35.389 align:start position:0%
Al a is that correct that's
correct

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that's it thank you Mr
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
chair anyone else from the committee
 
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.590 align:start position:0%
chair anyone else from the committee
representative

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
Griffin uh House Bill 436 which was
 
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
similar to this I think uh is superior
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
to this bill in that by reducing the
 
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.030 align:start position:0%
to this bill in that by reducing the
unac

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
unac
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
liabilities you earn money you earn more
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
investment money on the pension fund
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
which gives the
 
00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities a uh a benefit each year
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
future what's your viewpoint on
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
that the Viewpoint I guess would be is
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
that that the $50 million depend how
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's divided and set up and sent in is
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's nice to have to try to
 
00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:31.959 align:start position:0%
reduce some of the liability that there
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
is in is in the system and if you were
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
going to do 50 million a year I think
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
that would really really contribute to
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
it but the towns and cities the ones
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
I've talked to say that this actually
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
helps them a lot this actually gets to
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
the towns and cities to do something
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
with versus um a one-time shot at at
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
providing some I think it's good I some
 
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
personally believe it should do both
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.389 align:start position:0%
you
anybody

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%

also a uh representative from Hampton
 
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
and um I'm here to support my my system
 
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
was established in
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
1967 the legislature made a long-term
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
commitment to the cities towns and
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
school districts in New Hampshire that
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
in in in return for joining the
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
system the state would provide a
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the um annual
 
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.470 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the um annual
retirement

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
contributions um and as representative
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
Edgar mentioned that started at 40% and
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
um was that way for a number of years
 
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately was eliminated uh for
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
the 2012 fiscal year when the
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
contribution that represented probably
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
one of the largest tax increases ever
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
imposed on our towns cities and school
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
districts by the New Hampshire
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
legislature um it also imposed a
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
significant burden on
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
employees who were part of the
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
retirement system who um negotiated in
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
good faith uh wage and benefit
 
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.389 align:start position:0%
good faith uh wage and benefit
agreements

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
assuming um certain rates of um certain
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh rates that they would have to pay
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
into the retirement
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
system um I think it's in it's time for
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature to correct that that uh
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunate error um um particularly um
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
in a time when we do have uh some
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
significant financial
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
surpluses um and I would urge the
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend to the Full House
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill be passed um as presented
 
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
that this bill be passed um as presented
thank

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
you questions from committee
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
members are you aware that in the 2012
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
budget the majority of the difference in
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
the money that had been contributed by
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
the town taxpayers was actually
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
contributed by the
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
employees paying more than 2% or two and
 
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
a quarter or 2 and a half% more in their
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
contribution than they were prior so
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
that covered most of the cost it didn't
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
pass on that much to the municipalities
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know why that that false Rumor
 
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.269 align:start position:0%
I don't know why that that false Rumor
Has

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
Has
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
persisted well portion of the increase
 
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
still was absorbed by the communities
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
but your question um just confirms the
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
or Echoes the point that I made in my
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that um a large share of the
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
burden was imposed on the employees the
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
employees who are our teachers our First
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
Responders um and who who entered into
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
good faith bargaining agreements
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
assuming um that they would receive
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
term representative hacken Phillips
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
is it true that towns and municipalities
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
are currently planning for and proposing
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
their new budgets for the up coming
 
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.629 align:start position:0%
their new budgets for the up coming
fiscal

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
year um it's far beyond proposing I mean
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
the the warrants have been written and
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
um yes those um are going to be uh put
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
to the voters uh in most cases in March
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
and a followup Mr J and um
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
representative is it also true that the
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
town's budgets are significantly
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
affected by the New Hampshire retirement
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
sister system contributions and that an
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
increase of state aid towards this
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
contribution would make it more likely
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
that the local property tax races rates
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me could be decreased or lessened
 
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.150 align:start position:0%
excuse me could be decreased or lessened
for

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:18.519 align:start position:0%
taxpayers absolutely thank you thank
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%

Hampshire thank you chairman wer members
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
of the finance committee my name is
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
Deborah H I am here representing the
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teachers New
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our 3700 members across
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
the state and all of our retirees who
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
are in indeed members of the New
 
00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:01.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and um I'm
 
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
here just to talk a little bit about um
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
the impact that the change in terms has
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
had on municipalities from a Workforce
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
standpoint um the increase that M
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities have had to pay for their
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
share of the retirement system has
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
become a drag on Workforce Recruitment
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
and Retention um it takes up an
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
increasing share of municipalities
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
budgets and it means that it is harder
 
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
to raise wages to be competitive in the
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
current environment um it's hard for
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
them to keep up with Private Industry
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
many public service jobs that are vacant
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
at this point and it makes it hard to
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know keep par Educators keep
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
teachers special education teachers in
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
particular uh jobs filled makes it hard
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
to keep Public Works jobs filled makes
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
it hard to keep the roads clear on snowy
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
days like today or the sideworks clear I
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
walk through slash to get here um
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
so going back to what was either
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
originally promised or even just
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
7.5% of the state contribution to the
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
retirement system which was made to
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
encourage municipalities to join the
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system would be a huge help
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
to local budgets it could allow easing
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
the burden on local property taxpayers
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
and could allow municipalities to uh
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately recognize their Workforce
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
and fill some of these many many empty
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
positions police fire Public Works and
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
indeed in the schools to provide the
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
services that our Granite State citizens
 
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:47.559 align:start position:0%

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
all passed around and I apologize I
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%

Dr welcome to
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
finance thank you uh good morning my
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
name is Adam denor I'm the assistant
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
director of the municipal and property
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
division at Dr uh agency does not have a
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
position on this legislation but there
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
is one piece of information I wanted to
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
pass along uh when repayments like this
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
occur we incorporate that into our tax
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
rate setting process which is a quite
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
busy season which starts on October 1st
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
if there isn't a provision in this bill
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
to include a date that retirement
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
provides us with those figures ideally
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
that would be October 1st it can start
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
to affect tax rate setting um a couple
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
of years ago when these repayments were
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
made I think it took until close to the
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
middle of October for us to receive the
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
figures and so therefore a number of
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
cities and towns uh went without a tax
 
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
rate from for you know close to 30 days
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
because we needed to get those figures
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
to start the process so that's pretty
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
much all I wanted to pass along is that
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if there were a date in
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
there that we could receive these
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
numbers by to make sure that no tax rate
 
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.390 align:start position:0%
numbers by to make sure that no tax rate
is

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
affected thank you sir questions from
 
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.630 align:start position:0%
affected thank you sir questions from
committee

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
members so how much reduction in in the
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes was there this last year
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
with the contribution of the seven and a
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
half that's an excellent I can certainly
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
get the answer for that um hopefully but
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
I I do not know off top of my head about
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
as much as the 100 million that we put
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
in reduce to sweat it didn't seem to
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
make much
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
difference I I unfortunately I do not
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
have yes represent hack thank you Mr
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair um if I could just go back to your
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
testimony and um clarify you said you
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
needed a date to for the Dr to be able
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
to discharge like its rate setting yeah
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
could you could you give us like a
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
walkthrough of what you what the Dr
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
would prefer to see in terms of date
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
setting sure absolutely yeah there's a
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
number of pieces of information um
 
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
certainly Financial from the
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
municipality itself but also if they're
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
part of a Cooperative School District or
 
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
any number of other agreements that
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
require convergence of data for us to
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
set an accurate tax rate and one this
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
would be this repayment would be one of
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
those items um we begin tax rate setting
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
on October 1st and um so if we don't
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
have that information by October 1st it
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
it is inevitably going to delay rates so
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
is I'm sorry Mr chair may have a quick
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
call up um so is it correct to say that
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
um if the dates could be set prior to
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
September 30th of the year that they're
 
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
currently contemplating in this language
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
um would that be an appropriate deadline
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
to have that information set over to the
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
Dr absolutely okay thank you so
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
much further questions from committee
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
members seeing none now we will call
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
upon the head of the um retirement
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
Carlin welcome to
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
finance uh thank you Mr chair u a bit of
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
a correction I am not the head I am the
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
director of communications and
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs the to get in front
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
of any skis um and for the record my
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
name is Marty Carlin nhrs does not have
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
a position on this bill as one of the
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh spoke to this is similar
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
language to that both has been
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
introduced in the House and Senate in
 
00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
recent years this bill um would not
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
change the amount of money nhrs receives
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
um in total rather it would just have
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
the state be picking up a portion of
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
what normally would be p paid for by the
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
employer so there's no uh impact on the
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability there's a you know
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
the earlier Bill referred to house bill
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
50 was a one-time appropriation towards
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
the unfunded that would have been
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
recognized over 20 years and lowered um
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
the employer contribution rate so the
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
rate itself would have been lower uh by
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
some amount this is a basically you know
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
a subsidy for contributions for uh local
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
police teacher and fire costs um
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
as um the previous speaker indicated um
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
you know with in involving tax rates
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
that that's not how the reimbursement
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
traditionally worked there was a bill in
 
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
2022 that was a one time 75%
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation that at the time that was
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
about 26 million I believe and that was
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
after the fiscal year so in that case it
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
was the state was refunding the
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
proportion that the employers paid in
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
that prior fiscal year when when the um
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
State contribution was in effect you
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
know from
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
1977 through
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
20110 it we had a mechanism with the
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
state where we were you I think I'm not
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
sure what exactly the frequency was but
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
the employers weren't paying 100% they
 
00:23:17.549 --> 00:23:17.559 align:start position:0%
were paying you know 70% and then we
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
were billing the state over the course
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year and then reconciling
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
it at the end so this bill doesn't speak
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
to the mechanics so I think I think we
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
would want to work that out if this bill
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
were to pass with with uh the the
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate state agencies to see the
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
the the whole sort of mechanism both the
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
state and uh nhr has changed software
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
platform significantly since 2010 so we'
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
kind of have to reinvent the wheel but
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's how the process had traditionally
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
worked when this was an annual subsidy
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
the 2022 bill was a one time after the
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
fact payment so that there's a little
 
00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
bit of a difference there be uh be glad
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions anyone has about
 
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.510 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions anyone has about
the

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
sheet I guess we've heard from most of
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
these people Mike Edgar signed in and in
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
in favor Brian real I think it is um
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
pffnh signed in in favor uh Chris muns
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
we heard from him also signed in in
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
favor I only have the three names on the
 
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
blue sheet anyone in the audience that
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
wished to sign in and didn't all right
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
we will close the hearing
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
1279 and I believe it will be going to
 
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.750 align:start position:0%
1279 and I believe it will be going to
division

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
few minute break before we start at
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
10:30 on House Bill
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%

00:25:56.679 --> 00:30:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
so on on the last bill
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
1279 there were some people that U put

County
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh in his essay The People's Liberty
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
honorable Dan itsa explains that to
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
discuss the nature of our Constitution
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the government it guarantees to the
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
people living in the state of New Hamp
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
is extremely important in fact part 1
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
article 38 States clearly that the
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
people are to go back and study the
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution frequently so as to be able
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
to force those in elected offices to
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
adhere to the Constitution quote a
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
frequent recurrence to the fundamental
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
principles of the Constitution begins
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
this article there is a misconception
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
that only lawyers are competent to
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
understand the Constitutions this
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
misconception has led to an abuse of of
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
the people under the guise of
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionality by the
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
Judiciary when considering the
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution we should consider that the
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
prim primary expository works on the
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
constitution for the United States of
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
America The Federalist Papers and the
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
Anti-Federalist papers were written as
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
newspaper articles for everyone to read
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
these writings themselves have been edit
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
edited even for the students of
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
law realize how much this controls the
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
understanding of interpret ation of the
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
Constitution however if one reads these
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
expository works then and then reads the
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution one realizes how simple and
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
straightforward the Constitution is they
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
simply wrote what they meant and except
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the changes in our
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
language no interpretation is necessary
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
and their definitions of the words are
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
obvious from the context the
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States is
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
even more straightforward than the con
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the constitution for the state
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire is even more
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
straightforward than the Constitution of
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
the United
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
States that for our constitution was
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
meant for the average person to read and
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
comprehend is obvious from the
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution itself as a new state
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
representative my campaign centered
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
around fixing the problems in our state
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
when one takes the oath to uphold the
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution and the US
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's quite overwhelming to
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
be faced with 800 to a th000 pieces of
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
legislation the different stakeholders
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
information presented through the
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
hearing process challenges your
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that is when the New
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution proves itself to
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
be a valuable guide since I've started
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
studying the New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
my favorite article can be found in part
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
1 article
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
38 my favorite uh local Constitution
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
expert calls it the voter guide uh so I
 
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
brought this forward um out of a
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
constituent request as well as um a
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
personal request I constantly visit the
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office and ask
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
for copies of the Constitution and uh
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
quite frequently they have to go back
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
into the archives uh because the ones
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
that are printed for the current
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
Administration are saved for um the
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
fourth graders or the high schoolers and
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
and there's not enough for me to hand
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
out to my constituents so um uh this is
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
this is a request to increase the
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
funding I just simply doubled it um and
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that you will see uh OTP
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation thank you thank you
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee for
 
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.349 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee for
representive

00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
Hobson representative tersi thank you Mr
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to I don't know
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
if I'm first when I read this I was a
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
little confused because it seems silent
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
on what they were for but you're saying
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they're for the Secretary of
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
State's office to distribute to the
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
public when
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
requested thank you for the question yes
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh when I um
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
I guess one of my constituents uh was
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
looking to uh pick up a box of
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
constitutions and um it was made clear
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
to her that there wasn't enough and so
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
that if we wanted to print more we would
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
need to put more money into the budget
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason for
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
this followup
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
followup this may be a question for the
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
secretary but um do you know the um the
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
primary um users of the existing um
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
constitutions and I only ask because I'm
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if online versions aren't
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient for um School
 
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.670 align:start position:0%
sufficient for um School
purposes

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the I I think everyone should have a
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
copy of it um everyone should read it
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a great document and
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
there's something different about having
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
a physical copy um it's it's easy to
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
read it's easy to reference I think that
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
people don't look at online resources
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
the way they would look at a a physical
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
book um but you can certainly probably
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
have more information from the Secretary
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
you further questions from committee
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you representa
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hobson oh wait a minute represent hacken
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair I'll wave my
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
arms a little higher next time um I did
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
have a question about the um note the
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it says that the Department
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
of State indicates the bill appropriates
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
$155 per copy of the Constitution but
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
according to the most recent cost
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
estimates from June
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
2023 it actually cost $148 per copy and
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
I was just
 
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.750 align:start position:0%
I was just
wondering

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
um why the variance why why such an
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
increase so I'm not aware oh thank you
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
for the question and I'm not aware of
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note where that information
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
came from I actually got a copy of the
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
latest invoice that the secret Secretary
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
of State's office paid and that's what I
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's what I was using as a quick
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair would you support uh
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill that lowers
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
the um total allocation according to the
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
actual per cost per
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
copy um once the bill goes to committee
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's yours to do with what you will and
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
I think the Secretary of State's office
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
has uh an amendment um that he'll be
 
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
has uh an amendment um that he'll be
talking

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
about

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
forther oh no I'm okay represent
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
Emme thank you Mr chairman are these the
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
the small uh copies that fit in your in
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
your purse or your pocket that are about
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
2 by three in no actually uh thank you
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
for the question and no actually I was
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
um interested in the larger I think it's
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
5 by seven okay um I think that's a
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's a more attractive easier to read
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
version but um that's just my personal
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
preference okay thank you so again it's
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
your your bill you can do with it what
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
you need to
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
string you um thank you for taking my
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
question and and for joining us today um
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
you indicated this is a doubling of the
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
budget um is that mean that we uh print
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
and and uh give out 10,000 copies of the
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
now thank you for the question right now
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
I think there are 5,000 that are printed
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not aware I think that there
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
is a statute that indicates high school
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
students should be receiving a copy of
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution as well
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
as I know they give it out to the fourth
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
graders so in my in my uh estimation if
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's not enough for General members of
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
the public to come pick some up for
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
different events and things like that
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
then we probably should be printing a
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
lot more than 5,000
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
so that was where that number came
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
from in my discussions with
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hobson the fact that they
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
the first few pages are the governor the
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
speaker of this house senate president
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
and some of the other um
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
leaders those are photos that have to go
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
in there it adds to the cost and it adds
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
to the and the fact that it it expires
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
in two years so if we had just the text
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
like represent Emer said in like a 3in
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
by 6 in thing that you could fit in your
 
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
pocket um it would last for years
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
because the text doesn't change that
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
often and if it did then we' go through
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment process and we we would
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
have to replace it but to have some that
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
would last for a while on the Shelf
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
without being um outdated in two years
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
would would be a big Improvement and
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
then the secretary of state will tell us
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
how it can be funded and maybe the
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
format and we'll discuss that maybe in
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee but thank you
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative Hobson and so we will now
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
hear from the Secretary of State who
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
maintains this document and has it
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
years welcome secretary
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
scanland thank you Mr chairman members
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm David scanland
 
00:41:27.069 --> 00:41:27.079 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh and I support uh this
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
legislation uh I think it's always good
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
that we can make constitutions available
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
not only to the school children in the
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
state but any any New Hampshire citizen
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
um when we print these uh we print
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
enough for the school children and then
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
we have some left over which we
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
distribute to the general public when
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
they come into our office and ask for
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
them uh sometimes we get low on them and
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
we have to run up to the archives to
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
find uh volumes from past years uh that
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
available this is uh this is what the
 
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution looks like uh that we
 
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.430 align:start position:0%
Constitution looks like uh that we
currently

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
provide we print these every two years
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
and we put them out to bid whenever we
 
00:42:21.069 --> 00:42:21.079 align:start position:0%
do that which is a reflection of the
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
cost and and how that differs from bium
 
00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:25.150 align:start position:0%
cost and and how that differs from bium
to

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
bium um what I would suggest is that uh
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee asked me how
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know is there a way that we could
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
fund these and the short answer is yes I
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
believe that we can fund them from
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
within the department we have uh what's
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
called a notary fee account which is in
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
RSA uh 5 colon
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
10-b uh that account is uh is the result
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
of contributions a portion of the fee
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
for uh becoming a notary public or a
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
justice of the peace and out of that
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
fund we produce a manual uh for notaries
 
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.470 align:start position:0%
fund we produce a manual uh for notaries
and

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
justices the Nexus is that the justices
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the peace are a
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh position and they are
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
listed in article two part 2 article 75
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution and then when you look at
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
the stat statute uh that applies that's
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
actually mentioned in the proposed
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
legislation RSA 455 colon
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
17 uh it directs my office to print
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
these Publications from uh those funds
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
and any other educational materials that
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
are important to notaries and to make
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
these available to the general public so
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
that fund uh the notary fee account
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
which is in 510- B uh builds up uh and
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
surplus uh actually every year uh the
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
law says that when the banum is over we
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
maintain $100,000 in that account and
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
then anything above and beyond that is
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh lapses to the general fund so
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
there is money in that account to do
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
this I suggested printing up to 10,000
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
copies per uh bium so that we can manage
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
the inventory of those copies uh
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
obviously if you know we do an initial
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
Printing and the next bium we still have
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
5,000 left then we're not going to do
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
another 10,000 we're going to do
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
something less than
 
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.150 align:start position:0%
something less than
that

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think that's really all I need
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
to say I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
I'm happy you bring this funding to us I
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much so we don't have
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
to worry about where we going to get the
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
money from from I wonder if you're going
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
to change the format to leave out the
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
photos which should lower the cost and
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
and have it not expire would you
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
consider that I I certainly would
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
consider that I you know I'll leave that
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
direction to the legislature to let me
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
know what you would like to see
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
obviously for the school children you
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
know we would still do this version that
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
has the photos in it I would consider
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
this that that kind of a separate
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
account and this would be a new so if
 
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
you want if you want uh the
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
3x4 versions or if you want the larger
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
one without with or without photos uh
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
just let me know it was interesting when
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
years ago when my fourth grade class
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
came and I from my school not from my
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
fourth grade class that was a million
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
years ago but handed it out to each
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
student and I thought this is cool
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to each have a copy of
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
this so then I spoke to one of the
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
fourth grade kids and said so have you
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
got your Constitution at home so you can
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
study it he said no the teacher kept
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
class so you know we try we TR we try to
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
do some one thing right and and it
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't always last but that was the way
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
it went thank you very much appreciate
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
you bringing us the information
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative tersi I got a couple more
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
questions over here thank you for being
 
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
here today I have a quick question do
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
you feel the legislation's actually
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
needed or could your office just simply
 
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
print more Constitution since you
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
available I think the legisl legislation
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
is needed if we want to use this source
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
of of Revenue right now we print them uh
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
and the statutory requirement is for the
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
school children um and that the fund
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we use to print those I believe is
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
the same fund that we used to print the
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
red books the manuals for the general
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
court and I I believe we uh get an
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation of $220,000 a year uh for
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
that purpose um obviously printing a red
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
book is a lot more expensive than
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
printing the Constitutions but if we're
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
going to make the Constitutions more
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
broadly available uh
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I think it would help to have the
 
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
legislature say that we want to use the
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
funds in the notary account
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh to do that um because then the policy
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
position is clear thank
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
you representative grassy yeah there was
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
there was a comment that concerned me
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
from the previous speaker you're going
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
to have 10,000 copies but I think was
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
said was that if uh somebody wanted to
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
have an event and they wanted to come
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
and get a a box of them like I'm going
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
to have an event in Rochester I want a
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
thousand copies you're going to give me
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
a thousand copies you're going to run
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
out of them pretty
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
quick well we get those requests right
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
now and we ration them uh we try to make
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
them as available as available as we can
 
00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:05.079 align:start position:0%
we also like to know what the event is
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh obviously if it's a campaign event
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
and you know giving constitutions to
 
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
potential voters is is problematic and I
 
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
think that we try and exercise some
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
discretion there but if it is more of a
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
if it is a more nonpartisan public event
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
where issuing the Constitutions is
 
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
educational then
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we would consider giving a thousand
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
copies for an event like that how I mean
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
how would you be able to Li I mean I
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how you'd be able limit I
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
mean whether it was a campaign event or
 
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
a a public event for educational
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
purposes I mean how do you how can you
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
do that I mean it's public
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
information well we we try to gauge
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
what's you know what they're being used
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
for um and if it's if it's clearly you
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
know partisan a partisan of that's going
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
to benefit you know a candidate let's
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
say then then we would uh you know we
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
would hold back on passing those out but
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
like I said if it if it was a more of a
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
public event nonpartisan educational
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
then yeah I think it's appropriate to
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
make them available but I mean that is a
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
issue okay I guess uh representative
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
Stringham is next and then
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh hacken Phillips and
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
then representative Heath then
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire so let's remember
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
that order I thought you had your hands
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
up no all right representative hacken
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair thank you um
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
Mr secretary for taking my question um
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
is it true that there are full copies of
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state constitution
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
available on the Secretary of State's
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
website or the general court website the
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
I know the Constitution is ready readily
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
available uh I'm not sure if it's on our
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State website but it
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
certainly is on nh.gov
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh and it it is readily available yeah
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
and just a quick followup Mr chair uh is
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
there any reason that you couldn't refer
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
uh these additional public requests to
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
just go to the website to get those
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
copies is opposed to you know providing
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
extra copies that are not mandated
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
through current law to CH school
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
children um is there any reason why you
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
just couldn't refer them to the website
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why we couldn't do
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.230 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why we couldn't do
that

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
representa Heath thank you Mr chair and

thank you Mr secretary taking my
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
question um in terms of this bill um any
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
requests that we have for you in terms
 
00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
of how this document should be copied um
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
in the different formats would you like
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
to see that as an amendment to this
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
bill certainly any any specific guidance
 
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720 align:start position:0%

representative

00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
question have you ever actually run out
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the sense that you couldn't there
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
were fourth graders that didn't get a
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
current one or there were PE members of
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
the general public who didn't get at
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
least an old
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
one we have run out of
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
some versions depending on on the bium
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
we always make sure that the school
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
children get them as soon as they're
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
printed we distribute those and then
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's the ones that are left over that we
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
keep in our office for the public to
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
come in and pick up um we have run out
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
of those uh and when that happens we go
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
to the archives where uh we have the in
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
inventory of Prior years stored and we
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
bring those in um you know
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh we I guess the short answer is yes
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes we run
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
out May so but the archives sounds like
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
it's an unlimited supply of constit I
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
mean is the archives going to run out at
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
some point no but you have to remember
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
that the versions of the Constitution do
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
change and so once you know once a a
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
change once the citizens of New
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vote on a constitutional
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
amendment uh during a general election
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
and they pass set then the old versions
 
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.670 align:start position:0%
and they pass set then the old versions
are

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:52:33.069 --> 00:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
are notated I understand thank
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
you and remember every one of us has a
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
copy in the black
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
book if we're wondering what's in the
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's right there in our
 
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.589 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's right there in our
black

00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
black
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
book further questions from
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
you very much for
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
coming on the blue sheet we do not have
 
00:52:54.839 --> 00:52:58.349 align:start position:0%
coming on the blue sheet we do not have
any

00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
signatures so this will go to division
 
00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.789 align:start position:0%
signatures so this will go to division
two

00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:03.799 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
make well it it talks about
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
ah all
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
right now we have a few minutes before

yeah

00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.079 --> 01:01:13.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
time being 11
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
o'clock we will open the uh public
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
1560 and the prime sponsor is
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chairman members
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
of the committee previous budget this
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
committee um reduced the amount of money
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
coming out of the business taxes uh the
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
governor had sent us a budget with 35%
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
of the business taxes going to the uh
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
education trust fund at one point it was
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
50% but with the reduction in in uh
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment we didn't need that
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
much uh we we reduced it to 22% because
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
I was here when we did the original
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and we made up what
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
it covered and it was only to cover
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
adequacy nothing else it was just
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
intended to be adequacy everything else
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
building Aid special ed tuition
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
Transportation came out of general fund
 
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
it did that for years and I thought it
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
should be restored to what it originally
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
was so we did that in this committee
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
brought it down to 22% which just about
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
covered adequacy and a little bit more
 
01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:40.839 align:start position:0%
we sent it off to the to the Senate and
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
they went from the 35% as originally
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor to
 
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
44% which left this
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
huge $200 million in an education trust
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
fund when those of us that sat here and
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
and heard something about the uh
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
litigation on the sonunu youth center
 
01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
realize they're over spending the 100
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
million that we did put in and they're
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
liable to have it spent in this next
 
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
this more than 100 million in this next
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
biennium so there are other places where
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
we will need this money and we will not
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
need an education because we've already
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
paid for that and we put it in the
 
01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
budget for two years so this money would
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
just sit in a trust fund and not being
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
able to use for perhaps the highway fund
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
when we've added to the highway fund
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
general fund we've added to the Fish and
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
Game general fund because their
 
01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
traditional um sources of revenue don't
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
cover them especially with people
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
getting 28 miles a gallon and driving
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles which are finally
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
going to pay something in this next year
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to have as as a finance
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
person I don't want to have this money
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
in a fund that can only be spent on
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
education when we need it in so many
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
other places so I bring this bill in to
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
try to re take that money that's
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
there at the end of of this fiscal year
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
and put it in the educa put it in the
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
general fund where we'll have more
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
flexible use of it if we needed it for
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
Education things we could use it we've
 
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
done that in the past we've always use
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
some general fund for the education uh
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
funding but to have an education trust
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
fund surplus of almost 200 million is
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
not in my estimation Good Financial
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
Management so I bring this bill before
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
us so that we can take that money and
 
01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
move it to general fund thank
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
you questions committee yes thank you Mr
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
question so you want to restore you
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
would like this legislation to restore
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
the education trust to its primary per
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of only only funding adequacy it
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that it just takes this
 
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
Surplus and puts it in general fund it
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect what's happened with that
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's for the next
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
budget so your your intent is not to
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
restore it toward its original
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
purpose we could do that ourselves
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
within the within the next budget that
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
would mean the education Freedom
 
01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
accounts would no longer be in that
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
account perhaps not unless we decide to
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
do that in the next budget follow up M
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
follow up so in the education trust
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
currently we have building Aid we have
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
special ed we have court ordered
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
placements that it's like an open
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
warrant because we don't know what the
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
cost will be we also have a new um uh
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
section this time and I'm going to
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
forget uh it's what is it situational um
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
episodic episodic um yep placements um
 
01:05:58.029 --> 01:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
and the costs with that we don't even
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to be yet so as
 
01:06:04.349 --> 01:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
we look at the trust as it stands right
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
now there are
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
multiple amounts of money that are
 
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
targeted in that
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
fund where in the general fund are we
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
going to put all these other
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
funds we have in the past uh virtually
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
funded all of them from the general fund
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
so the place as Financial managers we
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
have to have funds that we have
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
flexibility so they've always been
 
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
funded when we had extra people sign up
 
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
for any one of these programs we found
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
the money in the general fund and and
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
traditionally those are always funded in
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
the general fund follow up
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
though thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:06:50.359 --> 01:06:51.630 align:start position:0%
though thank you thank you for taking my
another

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
question just formally being at the the
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
department of Ed um and those other
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
costs like used to be catastrophic Aid
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
um those funds were never fully
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
funded and when the amounts were
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
intended to be divied out to school
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
districts more times than not the
 
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
reduction ended up being in the
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
percentage that went out to local school
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
districts to reimburse them for the
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
costs and in some years it could be as
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
low as 65% of the original
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
costs when we have a an account that we
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
have a general idea of what we're going
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
to spend it just seems to make so much
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
sense to in fact have them in a
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
consistent line item additionally what
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
about the lottery this is the lottery
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
sends a lot of money to the trust and it
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
just to me or or I should phrase it as a
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
question don't you think it makes more
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
sense publicity wise and for the State
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire when we see the ads on
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
TV about the lottery giving so much
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
money to the education trust doesn't it
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
seem more to make more sense to keep the
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
education trust sound and with funds
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
available for the costs that they will
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
incur over the cost of the bium as I've
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
said we've taken the money out of
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
general fund when we needed it for
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
education purposes but if we have it's
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
like the highway fund what if the
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
highway fund had a surplus and I
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
remember it did years ago and one
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
Governor wanted to have a holiday on the
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
on the um Highway fund so that he he
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
felt he could make it up with
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
tourism and we turned that down the
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
numbers didn't make
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
sense a specific fund like education
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
trust fund had a a single purpose in
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
mind and yes we have used the excesses
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
for other places and yes there was a
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
time when it was a decision by the
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education we put so much
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
money in and I remember doing the budget
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
and we do it how much should we increase
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
the education trust how much should we
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
increase special ed well here's how much
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
we spent last year how much should we
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
add for next year we were going up 12% a
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
year our 12% a budget that's you know 6%
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
a year what what is going on with
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
special ed are any of these schools
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
trying to keep it lower no so so there
 
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
were some years when everybody went a
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
little bit crazy and just kept spending
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
and spending on special ed and what
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
happened was the department of Ed scaled
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
it down and said okay you got so many
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
requests we can't fulfill them all
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to get a reduced
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
amount and even if there had been more
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
money in the education trust fund it
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
would have taken an act and a law to
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
move the money so you know that was that
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
was a decision by the department of Ed
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
those few years when we didn't fully
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
fund the requests because we couldn't
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
imagine they'd go up 20% a year or 20%
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
over over a budget who could have who
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
could imagined that you don't know what
 
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
to do when you have huge increases like
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
that and to try to say well we went up
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
we went up 10% last time let's go up 12%
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.669 align:start position:0%
yes thank
you

01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
so if in fact you transferred this money
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
back to the general
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
fund wouldn't it mean that at the end of
 
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.229 align:start position:0%
fund wouldn't it mean that at the end of
the

01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
banum really this money would end up
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
yes question it wouldn't now is it's to
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
stay in the education trust
 
01:10:59.229 --> 01:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
fund yes thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
you U Mr chair for taking my question um
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
maybe um because you were around at the
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
origination of the education trust fund
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
you can help me understand it was my it
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
was my understanding that the original
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
order from the New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
Court directed our state to create the
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund for the purposes of
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
protecting State funds to be spent only
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
on educational needs is that correct
 
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.430 align:start position:0%
on educational needs is that correct
correct

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
so isn't it I'm sorry just a quick
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead you're on a roll isn't
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
it also true then that with the recent
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court rulings
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
directing us as state legislator
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
legislators to increase educational
 
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
spending wouldn't that order be at risk
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
if we decided to empty the education
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund at the end of the year were
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
those funds would then lapse into the
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund my question is how is it
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
not at risk well at the end of the
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
budget time whatever Surplus goes into
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
the goes into the rainy day fund and
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
whether but when you say it's education
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
trust fund you can't put it in there so
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
you carry that on to the next budget I
 
01:12:08.719 --> 01:12:09.629 align:start position:0%
you carry that on to the next budget I
would

01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
suppose and you know but that would mean
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
that other things that we might need
 
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:15.950 align:start position:0%
that other things that we might need
more

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:12:19.149 --> 01:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
of we would not be able to fund we need
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
the flexibility we're the ones that do
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
the financing and the budget we need
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility we could still take money
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund and spend it for
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
whatever was needed if there was some
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
extraordinary cost in the uh education
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
side that wouldn't prevent us we've
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
always spent General funds for special
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
ed for tuition and transportation
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
building Aid all those came out of
 
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
General funds forever and I've been
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
doing this since
 
01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
99 so you know to say oh yeah we can't
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
do that because it's not in there and
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
even in the case where we didn't fully
 
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
cover the um special ed they could have
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
come back to the legislature if they
 
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
were a bill to put it in and said can
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
you give us more money in special ed
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
that would have been the way to do it
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
rather than say okay you're only getting
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
65% or whatever the percent they they
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
got that was a possibility to do but it
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
still would have taken some legislation
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
even if there were money in the
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to get that money
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
you would still need an appropriation
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
involved

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
Peter thanks Mr chairman thanks Mr
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my question instead
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
of just emptying the entire education
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
fund would you be ad meable to say less
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
$50 million so there'd be at least $50
 
01:13:47.709 --> 01:13:47.719 align:start position:0%
million in there instead of just taking
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
all the money out I would hate to make
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
it a Target that everybody oh I've got
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
an idea to spend that 50
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
million if there's a if there's a real
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
need that competes with all the other
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
needs they will get the money that's the
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
most important thing that's the decision
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
that Finance committees make and sell it
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the legislature but to
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
have the money tied up where it ties our
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
hands for other purposes I'm opposed to
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
it as a person that's supposed to manage
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
Finance it's not a good process okay
 
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.270 align:start position:0%
Finance it's not a good process okay
thanks

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
Dan thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
question don't we already have a a
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
companion piece to this which says that
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
if the education spending needs are ever
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
greater than what's in the education
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
trust fund that it's automatically
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
backfilled from the general fund well
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that all these years
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
and it would again it would take some
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to do it I don't think it's
 
01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.830 align:start position:0%
legislation to do it I don't think it's
an

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
automatic may I follow I believe it is
 
01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
in law that that that happens all right
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to if I may have a
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
followup so um to to representative
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
Heath point about um the lottery in
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
particular so we have a constitutional
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
requirement that Lottery money always
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
goes to education always
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
and so some might say well you've you've
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
co-mingled Lottery money and now maybe
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
some Lottery money is going back to the
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
general fund via this mechanism so
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we to make this
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
clear add a little something somewhere
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
else that says when we spend adequate
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
education we first use all lottery money
 
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
right and then fill it with other money
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund therefore
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's there would be nothing left in
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund that was yeah I
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
I disagree that anything is comingled
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
because it's already gone into the
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund everything from the
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
lottery that is Surplus obviously if the
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
lottery brings in a a billion
 
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.470 align:start position:0%
lottery brings in a a billion
dollars

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
600,000 7 700,000 goes to
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
prizes so yeah we can hear about how
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
much it brings in but most of that goes
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
to prizes and then a little bit goes to
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
Administration everything else goes to
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so the way you
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
would look at it as an accountant how
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
much did the uh Lottery bring in let's
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
say it's 100 million how much did you
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
spend on education let's say it's 500
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
600 million okay you've spent the money
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
already you can't argue that some it's
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
co-mingled in this
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus thank
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
you I think you said the same
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
thing any other questions from the
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee yes ma'am thank you Mr Mr
 
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we are all well aware of the
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
um court cases that revolve around
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
school funding and I think we are all um
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
probably understanding that there will
 
01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
be some major significant changes when
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
it comes to um how we determine school
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
funding would you not agree with me that
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
it may be prudent to take such a large
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
decision such as this and um either make
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
that a part of the uh the larger work in
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
the education subcommittee on school
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
funding or at least wait until we know
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
um what the future holds in the coming
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
year or two I went to the expert that we
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
all use for Education funding sitting
 
01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.390 align:start position:0%
all use for Education funding sitting
right

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
here and I asked Mickey if we took
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
everything we spent on education and
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
divided it by per pupil how much will
 
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
we'd be spending in 24 and 25 and it
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
came out if I recall it was like
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
7200 7300 so the figure that the judge
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
came up with interestingly enough we are
 
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
already spending if we contribute
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
everything that we put on education and
 
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
divide it by per pupil yes we're already
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
spending that so that's my defense for
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
this this decision by the judge we've
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
already done that so to say oh we need
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
to spend hundreds of millions more no we
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't we've already done it if we take
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
proper credit for everything we spent on
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
education and divided by the total
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
number of students that's what we get
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I sent that to the attorney general
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
after after Mickey sent it to me
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully he's used it but anyway that
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
was that was my decision when I heard
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
that oh you should spend 7,000 per pupil
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
not 4500 or whatever figure was we
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
did and I'm surprised they didn't use it
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
in the defense but it's there if we have
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
to use it thank you Mary thank you one
 
01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:50.310 align:start position:0%
to use it thank you Mary thank you one
final

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
question with regard to special
 
01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.750 align:start position:0%
question with regard to special
education

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
do you realize that local property
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay in excess to almost
 
01:19:07.149 --> 01:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
$900 million yearly for costs related to
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
level I know we have a formula that they
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
have to spend three and a half times the
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
average cost per pupil before they can
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
ask for Aid then they then they get an a
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
match 80% from the state 20% from the
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
town until it reaches 10 times the
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
average cost per pupil then all the
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
costs above that are paid for by the
 
01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
state follow
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
up do you know how often those costs are
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
fully paid back to local
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities from the Department of
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
Education I do not thank you
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee Dan thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the rainy day fund
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
issue that representative walner bro
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
brought up don't we really in in our
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
budget control and and anticipate what
 
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
we put into the rainy day fund because
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
for example in this past budget we spent
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of 2023 money on on ual things
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
that we wanted you know we we we we
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
spent we knew a surplus was coming sort
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
of and we spent part part of that on it
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
actual items uh and so thereby we
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
controlled what would would actually go
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
into the rainy day
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
fund yes that's why we took out of swept
 
01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.510 align:start position:0%
fund yes that's why we took out of swept
hundred

01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
million to help reduce property taxes
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
and this 26 million that we took for the
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
7.5% onetime payment for retirement
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
match so there was 126
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
million that went in the 2023 taxes that
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't there before how much did it save
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
us in taxes my bet my tax bill went
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
up so these people that that come in and
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
tell us we've got to have this money we
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
got to have this money to save taxes it
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't the schools will use up every
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
penny that's where 85% of my taxes go
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
and typically they'll come out with a
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
school report you have 28 fewer students
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
this year we've hired 18 new
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
people when you have people that don't
 
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.510 align:start position:0%
people when you have people that don't
have

01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
any real grasp of trying to be
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
efficient this is what we end up with
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
chairman yes
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
sing just in terms of the uh the
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
analysis um the 72 to
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
$7,300 that include did that include the
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
base payments plus special ad plus
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
everything else that the state puts in
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
all the money that the state put into
 
01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
all the money that the state put into
education

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
things uh School
 
01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.430 align:start position:0%
things uh School

um all those things tuition and trans
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
portation special
 
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
ed all those things if we total them all
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
together and divided it by the total
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
number of students it came out to the
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
7200 7,300 per student which how could
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
you say that isn't a per capita or a per
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
student cost or what we've
 
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
spent thank you follow follow isn't the
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
things out of the coming out of the
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
courts now mainly addressing just what
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
the base amount is not
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
adding on uh the other things I don't
 
01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
think they said base amount I think the
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
the language I read is you don't spend
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
enough per
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
pupil and after I added up everything or
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
had Mickey add up everything that's what
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
it came out to so that's how much we
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
spent you can't say that this that the
 
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:17.719 align:start position:0%
uh education funding was funding for
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
anything but pupils and their
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.229 align:start position:0%
anything but pupils and their
education

01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%

apparently I'm the only other speaker
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
here so that's the other purpose I'm
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
here today um uh first off I I would say
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of the points that I was
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to make in my testimony came up
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
for questioning um so uh I'll just uh
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
follow up on a few of those first um
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt that there are a lot of
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
needs the state has um
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
that this was uh mentioned earlier I
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
think that's exactly a reason not to um
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
move forward with this piece of
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislation because this would move this
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
These funds into the Gen into the
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
general fund um where there are uh this
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
committee knows there are a great number
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
of needs um not only in in education but
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
in Health and Human Services uh Public
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
Safety um one of the areas that uh I
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
think we've face in education but in
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
other Workforce in in other areas is the
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage and so the state's
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
ability to fund um uh an adequate
 
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
education and and the aid that comes
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
from the state that's critical for a lot
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
of school districts to be able to
 
01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
compete with those communities that have
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
an easier time raising the funds needed
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
when we are under such a a a a Workforce
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
shortage and
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
um not only are we competing with other
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
states for uh teachers and support staff
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're competing among communities and so
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh we already went through the usages of
 
01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund the other uh
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
points I would just raise again the
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
unknowns that we Face uh the LA the
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuit was mentioned um also the EFA
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
program the EFA program U has already
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
exceeded um budget amounts um in every
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
year that it has uh been there there are
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
several bills normally I would be down
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
the hall in House Education there are
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
four bills alone there that would expand
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh eligibility for that program and so
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
um again another unknown um Beyond just
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.350 align:start position:0%
uh the
lawsuit

01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh the last point I think I I I would
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
just make is that we feel that these
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
funds belong in uh public education and
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh they should remain there and we hope
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you'll find this bill um in
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate happy to take any
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
you anyone from the committee have a
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
question for Mr HW
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
question why is it that there are so
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
much funds in the education trust fund
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
is it possibly
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
because um at one time
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
there there were many more school
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
children than we have today and and so a
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
larger percentage of business taxes Etc
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
were needed for Education than they are
 
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
today with Excuse me with the with the
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
per pupil spending um relatively static
 
01:27:19.149 --> 01:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
and until uh recently uh I think that's
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
a part of it I also think that you know
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
we are in very good Economic Times and
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
so the uh so there is a robust Surplus
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
in um General funds uh maybe less so
 
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
this year but General funds and in uh
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and with those
 
01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.629 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and with those
obligations

01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
that are out there and those unknowns I
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
think it would be pretty mature to just
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
say that uh These funds ought to uh go
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
back into the mix with other other
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you uh Brian for
 
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um with the Advent of
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Charter Schools um we've
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
I think we've got somewhere in the
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
vicinity of um about four or 5,000
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
students that are currently attending
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
charter schools and of those children um
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
there's a percentage of those children
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
um who have
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities and because our statutes
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
state that
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
the uh sending School District Remains
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
the school of liability for those
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
services do you have any idea what the
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
costs are for those particular students
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
currently um to the local
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
municipality for the any idea what that
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
would be um I have heard this brought up
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
a number of times um I don't have the
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
exact figure before me but I think it
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
does bring up an important I listed a
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
couple of unknowns in education um this
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
committee is well aware that the uh
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire accepted a $46
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
million Grant from the federal
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
government to expand uh existing and uh
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
new uh public charter schools um and
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
that Grant we I believe several years
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
into that Grant I go to State Board of
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
Education meetings regularly and so I I
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
see the uh approval for expansion of
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
seats in existing and and new Charters
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
um that you know that is also an unknown
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
to to the the degree to which uh and
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is not to say positive or negative
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
about the grant or Charters is just that
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh with that significant amount of money
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
expanding um the legislature obviously
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
also didn't increase this past uh budget
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
for uh not only uh uh traditional but
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
also Public Charter School uh state aid
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
um that's another unknown that uh
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
presents itself and why it ought to be
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh why we think it's premature to to
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
take this action
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
now question thank you thank you Mr
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
Hawkins for taking my question I don't
 
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
expect you to be um an expert on the
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that have been filed however
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
since we were discussing with the prime
 
01:30:30.109 --> 01:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor um my question about if this is
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
um getting ahead of ourselves and we
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
should perhaps wait do you know we were
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
talking about the um average cost per
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
student Statewide but the um the amount
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
that the um the judge stated as his
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
suggested Baseline around that's base
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy so anything beyond that such as
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
special ed or any English language
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
Learners anything like that that would
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
make that amount go higher is that
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
correct in my understanding that's my
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Hawkins thank you
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
enjoy your launch we have uh on the blue
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
sheet we have one opposed and that is Mr
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
Hawkins okay no if there no other
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
comments this will close
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
the question thank you Mr chair Mr chair
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
I just wondered would we be able to get
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
the document that Mickey prepared for
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
you that you shared with the attorney
 
01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.310 align:start position:0%
you that you shared with the attorney
general

01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
yes okay great that'll be helpful thank
 
01:31:33.199 --> 01:31:35.270 align:start position:0%
yes okay great that'll be helpful thank
you

01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay I'm hesitant here everybody has
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
something else to say go ahead Dan yeah
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
this is in the nature of an announcement
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
I guess um so people were talking about
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the the conval and other lawsuits I
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional amendment being
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
heard Wednesday at 9:00 in judiciary if
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
anyone is interested that's relevant to
 
01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.910 align:start position:0%
anyone is interested that's relevant to
those

01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
